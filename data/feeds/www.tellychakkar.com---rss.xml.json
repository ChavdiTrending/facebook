The current track on the show depicts the village of Shirdi encountering a drug menace. Sai Baba had rescued villagers from the clutches of drug addiction.</p><p>Abeer Soofi has practiced law before becoming an actor. He was deeply affected after witnessing drug addiction cases.</p><p>When contacted, he said, \"I was a criminal lawyer before becoming an actor and practiced law for a brief period. During my stint I came across people turning to crime to satisfy their cravings for drugs. It was heart wrenching to see people commit theft to buy drugs and I couldn\u2019t fathom the reason for people to get addicted to something which destroys their lives in all aspects. I used to advise people to stay away from it whenever I could. With the upcoming track on the show, I was glad that such a noble message will be sent to audiences all over. I discussed the dialogues with the creative team and also added my own inputs in the same.\u00a0 It\u2019s a humble request to all to steer clear of these drugs which only cause harm and nothing else. Find something constructive to do, stay connected to family and friends.\u201d</p>\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">What do you think of Mere Sai, Abeer Soofi, and Supriya Pilgaonkar?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAlcohol and drugs do not solve any problems that we face in real life.

It has been well received by the masses due to its storyline. Actress Rukhsar Rehman who played a mother in the story is also getting rave reviews for her character. In an exclusive conversation with TellyChakkar, the pretty actress spoke at length.</p><p>When we asked her how comfortable she was playing a mother and she revealed something astonishing. \u201cWhen they initially approached me I was little apprehensive of playing a mother. But when I read the script and they narrated me my character, I just wanted to be part of this project. I knew this project is going to be really special. For me it doesn\u2019t matter if I play a mother or a grandmother, if it\u2019s a part of a big project and the outcome is going to be good, you enjoy playing that character,\u201d she said.</p><p>The original is set against the backdrop of Kashmir, however the makers have made sure to not touch the sensitive aspect of the war hit region. \u201cWe have not touched any political issues in the show. Kashmir just fitted the background as a geographical state that is instable. Also, in the northern parts there are restrictions for women, that was required in the storyline,\u201d she explained.</p><p>Talking about the head honcho of ALT Balaji, Rukhsar commented, \u201cSince 10 -12 years I wanted to work with Ekta Kapoor. She has given jobs to many people not just actors but also technicians. Many houses run thanks to her. One of the reasons why I picked this show up is because I wanted to work with her. I have immense respect for Ekta and for what she has done for actors like us.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The lady has been away from TV for some time. She started her Cwith Bhaskar Bharti (2009) and was last seen in Dream Girl (2015). When we inquired her about what keeps her away from TV and pat came her reply, \u201cMoney and characters are keeping me away from TV. They should start offering actors a little good and better money. By the end you need to have a satisfaction that you\u2019ve done something credible.\u201d</p><p>Rehman started her career at the age of 17 and then took a pause.\u00a0 In her 26 years long journey, the actor feels she has got her dues. \u201cTo get dues, you just need to be there at the right place at the right time. Even TV is big. A lot many people say that they are not satisfied doing TV. I don\u2019t feel like that, I feel nice being a part of television. What is the point of doing a film that nobody watches and be happy about it and not be happy doing TV that lakhs of people watch,\u201d she concludes.</p>                           <div class=\"PMeta\">18 Feb 2018 05:00 PM | <span rel=\"sioc:has_creator\"><a href=\"#\">TellychakkarTeam</a></span></div>\n        </div>\n        </article>\n  </body>\n</html>\n]]></content:encoded>\n</item>\n<item>\n    <title>Congratulations: Sargun Mehta is the INSTA Queen of the week!  </title>\n    <link>http://www.tellychakkar.com/tv/tv-news/congratulations-sargun-mehta-the-insta-queen-of-the-week-180218</link>\n    <description> Mumbai: She is beautiful, she is stunning.

Last year, we had reached the semi-finals and this year we will definitely win the finals. So yes, collaborating with the team again is amazing,\u201d he says.</p><p>The actor adds that he loves BCL as a platform. \u201cIt is a great boost to cricket, it's very entertaining and it's the only platform where 200 actors come under one roof to play cricket,\u201d he opines.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The actor feels that it is not really that taxing to take time out to practice every day. \u201cIt is not very tough. It was very tough last year when BCL was going on for six months. But this time it is not very tough because it's only for 10 days. So, it's very easy. You can take time out after the shoot,\u201d he says.</p><p>Himmanshoo has always loved the game. \u201cI love cricket from the very beginning when I was six years old. I have been playing cricket on streets, in clubs then in leagues and then in under-19 tournament and I wanted to play for the country. So, cricket is my passion, my first love. Sports have formed a major transformation in my life,\u201d he shares passionately.</p><p>Talking about his main responsibilities as a captain, the actor briefs, \u201cThe main tasks and responsibilities are to get together and form a strong team. The team is doing good, the boys and girls are fabulous and the responsibilities will be, as a captain, to acknowledge all the good that has happened in the team and take all the blame. That's what leaders are supposed to do.\u201d</p><p>Himmanshoo says that more than practicing every day, the team needs to work on certain aspects of the game. \u201cOn a day-to-day basis, I don't practice much but cricket is something that's in my DNA. There's hand-eye coordination, which I think I am blessed and gifted with and the moment I see the ball, the bat starts moving automatically. I don't need to practice much. I think you need basic confidence, fearlessness and the hand-eye coordination to play brilliant cricket.\u201d</p><p>Talking about building stamina, the actor says, \u201cRight now I am undergoing CrossFit, an advanced form of training, because there's a new project lined up and I am shooting for that, so the training is going on very hard these days. CrossFit is for cardiovascular strength and I totally love it.</p><p>\nWhat do you th</p><p>The actor loves working with Anand Mishra. \u201cHe has always been fantastic. He loves cricket and enjoys entertainment and he is a wonderful and warm person. I always liked him; he keeps inviting me to all the other events which he handles. It's really nice to connect with him,\u201d he says.</p><p>Ask Himmanshoo who his favourite player is, and he says, \u201cMy favourite cricketer has always been Sachin Tendulkar but every cricket fan\u2019s favourite is M. S. Dhoni. He is loved for the kind of leadership skills he has, for the kind of brain he holds in cricket field and for the kind of calmness he holds. I think it's fantastic. Following Sachin, Virat Kohli is also fantastic and he is India's favourite right now.\u201d</p>                           <div class=\"PMeta\">18 Feb 2018 11:00 AM | <span rel=\"sioc:has_creator\"><a href=\"#\">TellychakkarTeam</a></span></div>\n        </div>\n        </article>\n  </body>\n</html>\n]]></content:encoded>\n</item>\n<item>\n    <title>Mika Singh calls for a Daawat with Super Dancer Chapter 2 contestants</title>\n    <link>http://www.tellychakkar.com/tv/tv-news/mika-singh-calls-daawat-super-dancer-chapter-2-contestants-180217</link>\n    <description> Mumbai: Popular singers Mika Singh and Daler Mehndi were awestruck with\u00a0Super Dancer Chapter 2\u00a0contestants\u2019 performances which will be aired\u00a0this Saturdayand\u00a0Sunday.Mika Singh, known for his top songs like\u00a0Agal Bagal\u00a0and\u00a0Aaj Ki Party\u00a0to name a few, was so impressed with the talent these future superstars have that he invited all the contestants at his residence for a Daawat.

The kids are so energetic and are the future superstars. When I saw their performances on the show, I was very surprised and astounded with the kind of talent they have.

Featuring the much loved Rubina Dilaik and Vivian Dsena who play the protaganists - Saumya and Harman, the show is now exploring a new track that threatens the foundation of their very relationship.</p><p>Testing the depth of their love is Saumya\u2019s decision of participating in the Aravan Puja. Having accepted Saumya the way she is, Harman is against this puja that highlights old traditions of the Kinnar community. For this immensely critical sequence, 70 real kinnars have been roped in to maintain authenticity and portray the scene aesthetically. Moreover, the makers of the show have even selected a beautiful outfit for the very glamorous Rubina.</p><p>She will be seen draping a rich, red Banarasi saree, inspired by the one worn by Anushka Sharma for her own wedding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:Center\">What do you think of Rubina Dilaik and Vivian Dsena?</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Rubina elaborated, \u201cSymbolic of a marriage to the Aravan God, the puja is a landmark ritual for the Kinnar community wherein they pray to be born as women in their next birth. Saumya wants her relationship with Harmanji to last for eternity but little did she know that this puja would in fact threaten the love and respect that he already has for her. Shooting with the extended cast has been both, challenging and inspiring in its own way. It was definitely one of the most crucial sequences we have shot for so far in the show. \u201d</p>                           <div class=\"PMeta\">17 Feb 2018 04:02 PM | <span rel=\"sioc:has_creator\"><a href=\"#\">TellychakkarTeam</a></span></div>\n        </div>\n        </article>\n  </body>\n</html>\n]]></content:encoded>\n</item>\n<item>\n    <title>Amit Khanna to play a significant role in Vaani Rani</title>\n    <link>http://www.tellychakkar.com/tv/tv-news/amit-khanna-play-significant-role-vaani-rani-180217</link>\n    <description> Amit Kahann, Govinda&#039;s nephew and brother of TV actress Ragini Khanna, who is trying to get back to acting after his sucessful debut in Yeh Dil Chahe More is finally shaping his career on the silver screen with steady grace.Seen in Vishkanya\u00a0(Zee TV), Amit will now be seen in Vani Rani (&amp;amp;TV).

He brings complete charm and ease in his character and feels blessed to be a part of the show.While actors have to go through a lot of look trails to get the costume right, Jitin Gulati had to go through the same. His costume passed the test but it\u2019s his hair look that had to go through 8 to 10 look tests. The actor poses 2 looks, one with a bun and another in open hair in order to support the mukut and ensure it doesn\u2019t come off during scenes.When asked Jitin, he said, \u201cTo get my hair look correct, the look tests were necessary. It was important to get it in right proportions.\u201dIn another incident, the actor who was doing a serious scene, required him to faint. This turned out to be a funny incident as his wig came off and he didn\u2019t understand why everyone was laughing. He adds, \u201cThe wig gets loose sometimes when am doing war sequences sitting on a horse as it gets hot. But this one time, we were shooting a very intense sequence which required me to faint. While I was deeply involved in the scene, I heard a lot of giggles around me and that\u2019s when I realized that the wig actually got stuck in the actresses jewellery while I still lay there with my eyes shut. It took me a sometime to understand what actually happened. It was quiet funny.\u201dWhile Jitin is having a tough time with his hair, we can only hope that he finds a better way to manage it.</p>                           <div class=\"PMeta\">17 Feb 2018 01:00 PM | <span rel=\"sioc:has_creator\"><a href=\"#\">TellychakkarTeam</a></span></div>\n        </div>\n        </article>\n  </body>\n</html>\n]]></content:encoded>\n</item>\n<item>\n    <title>Female cricketers should be paid equal to male cricketers: Helly Shah </title>\n    <link>http://www.tellychakkar.com/tv/tv-news/female-cricketers-should-be-paid-equal-male-cricketers-helly-shah-180217</link>\n    <description> Mumbai: Actress Helly Shah who will be seen in the forthcoming MTV Box Cricket League motivating the teams feels female Cricketers should be paid equal to male Cricketers.</description>\n     <pubDate>2018-02-17T12:04:00+05:30</pubDate>\n <author>TellychakkarTeam</author>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.tellychakkar.com/1799689</guid>\n<content:encoded><![CDATA[\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\" prefix=\"op: http://media.facebook.com/op#\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"http://www.tellychakkar.com/tv/tv-news/female-cricketers-should-be-paid-equal-male-cricketers-helly-shah-180217\">\n    <meta property=\"op:markup_version\" content=\"v1.0\">\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <article>\n\t                  \n        <div class=\"Posts\">\n          <figure><img src=\"http://tellychakkar.com/sites/tellychakkar.com/files/images/story/2018/02/15/Helly%20Shah.jpg\" /></figure>\n\t  <div class=\"Category\">News</div>\n          <div class=\"Title\"><a href=\"http://www.tellychakkar.com/tv/tv-news/female-cricketers-should-be-paid-equal-male-cricketers-helly-shah-180217\">Female cricketers should be paid equal to male cricketers: Helly Shah </a></div>\n                                         <p dir=\"ltr\">Mumbai: Actress Helly Shah who will be seen in the forthcoming MTV Box Cricket League motivating the teams feels female Cricketers should be paid equal to male Cricketers.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"I am happy that television has got a show on Cricket where boys and girls play the matches irrespective to their genders, which is credited for men by our society.

No doubt she is dear and sweetheart but at the same time she knows well how to be a victim. She feels that me, her producers, her co-actors, all are liars and she is the only one who is truthful.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>She further added, \"Shilpa has a habit of changing her words. In fact, she has a history of changing stance with time. After her statement where she has called me a liar, one thing is very clear, some people are not worthy of any relationship.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>(Aslo Read:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.tellychakkar.com/tv/tv-news/post-bigg-boss-11-arshi-khan-wishes-be-part-of-reality-show-180130\">Post Bigg Boss 11, Arshi Khan wishes to be part of this reality show</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Arshi and Shilpa had a weird equation even inside the house. There was a brief period when the two contestants were extremely close. Arshi addressed her as \u2018Maa\u2019. However, as the tradition of the Bigg Boss house is, in no time their equation turned sour and Arshi got close to Hina Khan, by the end of the show. And now, looks like this war of words has still some time to go before it ends.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">What do you think of Shilpa Shinde?</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I still take shilpa as my friend and she will own my respect. I cant be poor at my heart. I always belive to move forward and remember all good people do with me forgiving the bad,\" She concluded.</p>                           <div class=\"PMeta\">17 Feb 2018 11:02 AM | <span rel=\"sioc:has_creator\"><a href=\"#\">TellychakkarTeam</a></span></div>\n        </div>\n        </article>\n  </body>\n</html>\n]]></content:encoded>\n</item>\n<item>\n    <title>Big Magic&amp;#039;s Chakradhari Ajay Krishna to go off-air</title>\n    <link>http://www.tellychakkar.com/tv/tv-news/big-magics-chakradhari-ajay-krishna-go-air-180217</link>\n    <description> Mumbai: These days a show getting pulled off just in the span of a few months is not much shocking.

The latest to suffer the burden of ratings is Big Magic\u2019s Chakradhari Ajay Krishna earlier named as Bal Krishna. \u00a0</p><p>The mythological drama is facing the axe from the GEC. The drama has gone through major changes through its inception, first with production house changes and later with actors. The show, based on the life of Lord Krishna, was earlier produced by Swastik Productions. Filmfarm productions later replaced the production house post the leap and changed the title. The daily featured Jaival Pathak in the titular role while Suman Gupta and Nimai Bali essayed Yashoda and Kansa respectively. Post the leap the character was essayed by Bhavesh Balchandi who was later replaced by Vishal Jethwa.</p><p>According to our exclusive information, 17 February is going to be the last date of shoot. A credible source confirmed the news with us.</p><p>Till now the drama has completed around 200 episodes. Though there's no particular date we've heard that the show will go off air by February end or first week of March. The series was launched on 14 March 2016.</p><p>We couldn't reach out to the actors or anyone from the unit for their official comment.</p><p>Meanwhile stay tuned to TellyChakkar for more such updates from the telly land.</p>                           <div class=\"PMeta\">17 Feb 2018 10:00 AM | <span rel=\"sioc:has_creator\"><a href=\"#\">Vinay MR Mishra</a></span></div>\n        </div>\n        </article>\n  </body>\n</html>\n]]></content:encoded>\n</item>\n<item>\n    <title>Colors\u2019 Kasam completes 500 episodes </title>\n    <link>http://www.tellychakkar.com/tv/tv-news/colors-kasam-completes-500-episodes-180216</link>\n    <description> Mumbai: Congratulations and celebrations!Let\u2019s cheer for the hardworking and dedicated team of Colors\u2019 daily drama Kasam (Balaji Telefilms) which is set to achieve a new milestone.The show will air its 500th episode tonight (16 February).</description>\n     <pubDate>2018-02-16T19:36:18+05:30</pubDate>\n <author>TellychakkarTeam</author>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.tellychakkar.com/1800309</guid>\n<content:encoded><![CDATA[\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\" prefix=\"op: http://media.facebook.com/op#\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"http://www.tellychakkar.com/tv/tv-news/colors-kasam-completes-500-episodes-180216\">\n    <meta property=\"op:markup_version\" content=\"v1.0\">\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <article>\n\t                  \n        <div class=\"Posts\">\n          <figure><img src=\"http://tellychakkar.com/sites/tellychakkar.com/files/images/story/2018/02/16/congrats.jpg\" /></figure>\n\t  <div class=\"Category\">News</div>\n          <div class=\"Title\"><a href=\"http://www.tellychakkar.com/tv/tv-news/colors-kasam-completes-500-episodes-180216\">Colors\u2019 Kasam completes 500 episodes </a></div>\n                                         <p>Mumbai: Congratulations and celebrations!</p><p>Let\u2019s cheer for the hardworking and dedicated team of Colors\u2019 daily drama Kasam (Balaji Telefilms) which is set to achieve a new milestone.</p><p>The show will air its 500th episode tonight (16 February).</p><p>The show struck chords with the audience in no time with its gripping storyline and stellar cast.

She was asked if a Harvey Weinstein also exists in Bollywood, and if the #MeToo campaign has helped women come out with their story in the entertainment industry.Ekta said, \"Well, I think there are Harvey Weinsteins in Bollywood, but there is probably an equal number of Harvey Weinsteins on the other side of the story, but people do not want to talk about that part. Yes, there are people in power like producers who use their power to take advantage of people, but at the same time there are people on the other side, like an actor or others who need the job, would also use their sexuality to get things done.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">What do you think of Ekta Kapoor?</p>\n\n \n\n<p>\"Therefore, I believe that predators should not be put in a box based on power. It is always not true that the person who does not have power is the victim,\u201d she further added.Citing an example, Ekta said, \"Being a producer, on a personal level when I talk to my male counterparts, they said they were propositioned blatantly. Is that person not a predator?\"In our industry, if one actor meets a producer at 2 a.m. and hooks up with him and after five days, if she wants a job based on that and the producer doesn't give the job because he wants personal and professional things separate, then who is the victim here? The interpretation is always that the powerful person took advantage of the poor little budding actor or something that is always not the truth.\"Ekta's father Jeetendra was earlier this month accused of sexually harassing his cousin, who came forward to file a police complaint 47 years after the alleged incident. Jeetendra dubbed the charges as \"baseless\", and a \"miserable effort by a jealous competitor to disrupt his business activities\".(Source: IANS)</p>                           <div class=\"PMeta\">16 Feb 2018 07:28 PM | <span rel=\"sioc:has_creator\"><a href=\"#\">TellychakkarTeam</a></span></div>\n        </div>\n        </article>\n  </body>\n</html>\n]]></content:encoded>\n</item>\n<item>\n    <title>Not Mihika, Ishita to MARRY Raman in Yeh Hai Mohabbatein; major revelation in store...</title>\n    <link>http://www.tellychakkar.com/tv/tv-news/not-mihika-ishita-marry-raman-yeh-hai-mohabbatein-major-revelation-store-180216</link>\n    <description> Mumbai: Star Plus\u2019 popular daily Yeh Hai Mohabbatein (Balaji Telefilms) has some extremely dramatic sequences with Raman (Karan Patel) getting hitched to Mihika (Avantika Hundal) and Ishita (Divyanka Tripathi) trying her best to win her husband back.TellyChakkar now has some exciting news which will double up your eagerness to watch the show!
