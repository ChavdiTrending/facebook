We would like to thank all the amazing fans that have made the first eight shows on the tour the best experience of our lives.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The other tour opener, Shawn Hook, said in a statement late Thursday that he was &#8220;obviously disheartened&#8221; by the allegations levelled against Hedley but would continue &#8220;to fulfil my contractual obligations.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On Friday morning, Hedley&#8217;s management team said it had terminated all &#8220;business relationships with the band&#8221; and the CBC announced it was dropping the group&#8217;s music from its radio and streaming platforms &#8220;in light of the serious allegations that have surfaced.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Corus Radio revealed it had suspended all airplay of Hedley songs across its 30 music stations, as did other stations in Edmonton and Vancouver.</p>\n<p>The Junos also dropped the Vancouver group from the upcoming televised awards bash in what was called a joint decision with the band &#8220;after careful consideration of the situation.&#8221; Wednesday&#8217;s move by the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences came shortly after the release of the band&#8217;s statement addressing claims of impropriety involving young fans.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All of us in Hedley respect and applaud the #MeToo movement and the open and honest discussion it has inspired. We believe these conversations are particularly important within the music industry, which does not exactly have an enviable history of treating women with the respect they deserve,&#8221; reads the statement, which also notes the band&#8217;s members &#8220;are all now either married or have entered into committed, long-term relationships.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;However, if we are to have a meaningful, open and honest discussion, we all have to accept and respect that there are at least two sides to every story. The recent allegations against us posted on social media are simply unsubstantiated and have not been validated. We would hope that people will bear-in-mind the context in which these unsupported accusations have been made before passing judgment on us as individuals or as a band.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hoggard rose to fame in 2004 as a charismatic, sexually-charged provocateur on the second season of the smash hit &#8220;Canadian Idol.&#8221; Although he finished in third place, the Surrey, B.C., native parlayed his screentime into a record deal and Hedley&#8217;s self-titled debut album the following year went on to go double-platinum.</p>\n<p>The band became teen darlings and perennial Juno and MuchMusic Video Awards contenders, with Hoggard developing a reputation for over-the-top red carpet antics, including commandeering reporters&#8217; microphones (in one case, sticking the device down his pants).</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/music/cbc-drops-hedleys-music-from-radio-streaming-service/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t<postmedia:alexa><![CDATA[Hedley dropped by management, radio, tour opener amid sexual misconduct allegations.

Muller's Tyanny of Metrics]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Tyranny of Metrics<br />\nJerry Z. Muller<br />\nPrinceton University Press<br />\n240 pp; $29</h3>\n<p>You might remember when Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill made better baseball through math. They were, of course, portraying the Oakland Athletics&#8217; Billy Beane and John DePodesta in Moneyball, the film based on Michael Lewis&#8217;s bestselling book. The rise of sabermetrics in baseball has corresponded to the exaltation of metrics across many other fields (e.g. Nate Silver&#8217;s Five-Thirty-Eight in politics; or the &#8220;numbers&#8221; person in your mathematically challenged office who just got promoted way past you). So are the rest of us just grumpy baseball scouts, stuck in our ways? According to Jerry Z. Muller&#8217;s The Tyranny of Metrics, perhaps not. Here&#8217;s what we learned:</p>\n<p><strong>1<br />\n</strong><strong>A numbers game. </strong>The main problem with metrics is, frankly, us. &#8220;Almost inevitably, many people become adept at manipulating performance indicators through a variety of methods,&#8221; Muller writes, &#8220;many of which are ultimately dysfunctional for their organizations.&#8221; In Wire-speak (a show the author references in his preface), people learn to juke the stats. Another of the book&#8217;s examples is that of a school gaming the system to attract donors rather than to improve student performance. And if a nonprofit becomes gamified, people will play the game rather than fulfill the organization&#8217;s mission, Muller notes \u2013 but this applies to commercial enterprise as well. Short-term goals that benefit the player may supersede the long-term goals of the company. Cascading effects can include, say, restructuring and layoffs designed to create an attractive takeover target, or the discontinuation of less profitable products that are still valuable (or even vital) to a portion of the market. The things a company does well, and the people who have experience doing them, can be lost before a company&#8217;s eyes, line item by line item.</p>\n<p><strong>2</strong><br />\n<strong>A specialization in generalization. </strong>Scientific management stresses that the similarities between organizations are more important than their differences, according to Muller, and this results in a &#8220;playbook&#8221; by which managers and consultants move between companies that produce drastically different things. This can proliferate the preference for external candidates over internal ones \u2013 for managers who have successfully used the playbook elsewhere, rather than managers who truly understand the business. &#8220;Getting your hands on the numbers&#8221; is then viewed as the most expedient way for a new executive to understand a company, says Muller, and carries with it a resulting downside: &#8220;Managers are on the lookout for metrics of performance that can be deployed when the headhunter calls.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>3</strong><br />\n<strong>Doctoring the numbers.</strong> Health care is one of the areas most vulnerable \u2013 or one of the most <em>important</em> areas that is vulnerable \u2013 to the corrupted use of metrics. Muller notes how the declining cost of consumer goods over time has affected the perceived cost of fields such as health care and education, contributing to the urge to &#8220;run them like a business.&#8221; He cites such negative results as surgeons avoiding riskier procedures to safeguard their stats, or hospitals keeping patients waiting in ambulances and corridors to artificially depress waiting-room times. In short, while the numbers can serve as a defence against liability litigation, they don&#8217;t ensure best outcomes in individual cases.</p>\n<p><strong>4<br />\n</strong><strong>Measuring morale. </strong>&#8220;Professionals tend to resent the impositions of goals that may conflict with their vocational ethos and judgment,&#8221; Muller writes. He&#8217;s referring to the hit morale takes when producers and practitioners are sidelined by administrators and technocrats: the point past which the desire for efficiency paradoxically becomes overregulation. It&#8217;s not that transparency and accountability sought through metrics are negative in principle (and honestly, people can feel overburdened by regulations out of simple laziness), but that, as Muller states, &#8220;the structure of their analysis becomes, in a way, dogmatic.&#8221; Meanwhile the heretics may hew to sociologist William Bruce Cameron, whom Muller quotes: &#8220;Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>5</strong><br />\n<strong>Summing up.</strong> So where do we go from here? Muller recommends asking these questions, as applicable in baseball as in medicine, to keep your eye on the ball: What kind of information are you thinking of measuring? How useful is the information? How useful are more metrics? What are the costs of not relying on standardized measurement? To what purpose will the measurement be put, or to put another way, to whom will the information be made transparent? What are the costs of acquiring the metrics? Why are the people at the top of the organization are demanding performance metrics. How and by whom are the measures of performance developed? Finally, Muller advises remembering that &#8220;even the best measures are subject to corruption or goal diversion,&#8221; and that &#8220;sometimes, recognizing the limits of the possible is the beginning of wisdom.&#8221;</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/takeaways-from-the-tyranny-of-metrics/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<postmedia:alexa><![CDATA[The problem with metrics is us, and other takeaways from The Tyranny of Metrics.

Since Friends has ended, Aniston&#8217;s become a film star in her own right, doing comedies like We&#8217;re The Millers and Marley &amp; Me, and earning a Golden Globe nomination for her work in the drama Cake.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Theroux was in a 14-year relationship with Heidi Bivens before linking up with Aniston.

The multimedia collection is aimed at children 3 to 13, but adults will get a kick out of many of the activities.</p>\n<p>At a recent media preview, few could keep away from an installation called &#8220;Dance with flARmingoes.&#8221; A huge wall-mounted screen shows a group of identical, digitally animated pink flamingoes. But step into the space in front of the screen and one of the birds will mimic your every move, flapping in time to your arms, kicking or walking as you do. It will even settle into the water if you crouch down.</p>\n<p>Another exhibit, simply named &#8220;Sun,&#8221; invites visitors to heft a huge grey beach ball. As it\u2019s lifted, another wall-screen bursts into brightness as a sun rises above an image of the horizon. You can create dusk, noon or anything in between by moving the ball.</p>\n<p>Many of the offerings are astounding for their simplicity. &#8220;RotoRing&#8221; has a single button and a dial to control an LED that must be moved into a specific spot on a game board; it\u2019s easy to grasp, difficult to master, and remarkably addictive. &#8220;Mizaru&#8221; is a soft fabric screen that emits piano music when pressed. And &#8220;Kaleidoscope&#8221; is a series of screens that create swirling patterns when stroked.</p>\n<p>The digiPlaySpace will be open from Feb. 17 through April 22, 2018. Its run nicely brackets that of the TIFF Kids International Film Festival, now in its 21st year and running from March 9 to March 18.

He\u2019s informing them of a new cue that needs to be updated in the sound banks. \u201cIt already got downloaded,\u201d one of the managers explains. \u201cIt\u2019s all good.\u201d Timberlake is stunned. \u201cSee what I mean?\u201d he hollers, beaming. \u201cYou ask for something, and it\u2019s already done.\u201d He begins to bow in awe of his impeccable crew. A stagehand grins: \u201cBetter than getting your ass chewed out!\u201d Everyone erupts in laughter as Timberlake, delighted, walks around giddily shaking hands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">A year ago, I\u2019d have said this anecdote was proof that Timberlake is impossible to dislike.

This is the season of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Man of the Woods</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, Timberlake\u2019s fifth studio album, and the order of the season, evidently, is to excoriate the decorated pop star with a ruthlessness usually reserved for has-been matin\u00e9e idols and talentless one-hit wonders. It\u2019s not enough for the commentariat to judge </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Man of the Woods </span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">an artistic blunder \u2014 one failure among an otherwise fairly unimpeachable catalogue.

Nor is Cox alone in the instinct. Practically every column inch dedicated to Timberlake in the immediate wake of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Man of the Woods </span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">has been concerned expressly with what the musician does or does not deserve: one mediocre album, and suddenly Timberlake is the embodiment of mediocrity, happening unqualified upon critical and commercial triumph undeserved. The press needs a narrative \u2014 some story, either provided or invented, to frame and contextualize an album and its otherwise amorphous collection of songs. The narrative seized upon for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Man of the Woods </span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">catastrophe</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">.</span></p>\n<p>It seems a matter of bad timing, partly. Timberlake has returned to prominence amid a climate not particularly amenable to what he appears to represent \u2014 a paragon of privilege, coasting with ease on the strength of advantages afforded to him by race, gender and sexual orientation. (He was welcomed back to the Super Bowl halftime show this year despite a gaffe whose infamy banished co-star Janet Jackson to oblivion; he\u2019s championed grassroots social-media campaigns and entertainment-industry calls-to-arms despite working, just last year, in a Woody Allen movie. These decisions haven\u2019t helped his image.) Timberlake does <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">benefit from privilege. All white men do, a truth he could stand to acknowledge. But if we are keen now to dismantle the reputations of stars unworthy of them, Timberlake is not an ideal target. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Timberlake has earned his place.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77152337\" style=\"max-width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img data-attachment-id=\"77152337\" data-permalink=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/music/man-of-the-moment-in-defence-of-justin-timberlake-still-a-pop-genius-despite-the-order-of-the-season/attachment/janet-jackson-justin-timberlake\" data-orig-file=\"http://wpmedia.nationalpost.com/2018/02/people-justin_timberlake-e1518713022899.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1000,751\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;AP&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;FILE - In this Feb. 1, 2004 file photo, singers Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson are seen during their performance prior to a wardrobe malfunction during the half time performance at Super Bowl XXXVIII in Houston.

On these records, Timberlake has created what mainstream pop stars almost never seem capable of, coherent albums with the shape and momentum of a statement, as opposed to merely haphazard stockpiles of hit singles buttressed by dispensable filler. These albums feel unmistakably authored: they are the clear, creative visions of an artist in full command of the means to realize them. It\u2019s funny, actually \u2014 so ubiquitous were \u201cMy Love\u201d and \u201cSexyBack\u201d as chart-toppers that it\u2019s amazing how inextricable they sound now from the overall flow of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">FutureSex/LoveSounds</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, a dazzling, self-contained masterpiece that demands to be enjoyed from start to finish in one sitting. How could anyone listen to this and conclude Timberlake simply lucked into a few fluke hits? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Of course, the homogenous aesthetic that makes </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">FutureSex</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> such a pleasingly uniform opus has a great deal to do with the powers of its innovative producer, Timbaland. But it\u2019s unfair to suggest \u2014 as the fiercest critics of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Man of the Woods </span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">continue to do \u2014 that Timberlake only chanced upon the record\u2019s brilliance by deferring to his producer, or, worse, exploiting him. Timberlake and Timbaland devised the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">FutureSex</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> sound as collaborators; Timberlake, not insignificantly, is credited as co-producer. He\u2019s never been the kind of pop star to commission the work of others passively or farm out songwriting duties to hit-makers as he waits around the studio for promising singles to fall in his lap. He takes not only an active role in his music but the primary role in its writing, recording, producing and performing \u2014 and that includes the responsibility of seeking out gifted peers whose ideas accord with his own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Timberlake\u2019s eagerness to solicit help from talented collaborators does not diminish his influence over his music or his responsibility for how it turns out. Indeed, his willingness to work with others no less than his taste in colleagues should be considered assets \u2014 features of his brilliance rather than flaws in his artistry. This virtue reached its apotheosis with his third album, 2013\u2019s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The 20/20 Experience</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. It was here that Timberlake expanded his sound to include the contributions of a sprawling backing band, The Tennessee Kids \u2014 two-dozen virtuoso dancers, singers and musicians (including guitarists, keyboardists, drummers and a full suite of brass players) who performed across the album and supported Timberlake on the two-year, 134-night, five-continent 20/20 Experience World Tour between 2013 and 2015, later immortalized in Demme\u2019s feature film. It would prove the most fruitful collaboration of Timberlake\u2019s career.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77152366\" style=\"max-width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img data-attachment-id=\"77152366\" data-permalink=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/music/man-of-the-moment-in-defence-of-justin-timberlake-still-a-pop-genius-despite-the-order-of-the-season/attachment/topshot-us-entertainment-amfoot-music-2\" data-orig-file=\"http://wpmedia.nationalpost.com/2018/02/afp_ys7jj1-e1518713957369.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1000,750\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;AFP\\/Getty Images&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;TOPSHOT - Singer Justin Timberlake performs during the halftime show of Super Bowl LII at US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on February 4, 2018. \\/ AFP PHOTO \\/ ANGELA WEISSANGELA WEISS\\/AFP\\/Getty Images&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;AFP or licensors&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;TOPSHOT-US-ENTERTAINMENT-AMFOOT-MUSIC&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"TOPSHOT-US-ENTERTAINMENT-AMFOOT-MUSIC\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://wpmedia.nationalpost.com/2018/02/afp_ys7jj1-e1518713957369.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"http://wpmedia.nationalpost.com/2018/02/afp_ys7jj1-e1518713957369.jpg?w=640\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-77152366\" src=\"http://wpmedia.nationalpost.com/2018/02/afp_ys7jj1-e1518713957369.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"http://wpmedia.nationalpost.com/2018/02/afp_ys7jj1-e1518713957369.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225 300w, http://wpmedia.nationalpost.com/2018/02/afp_ys7jj1-e1518713957369.jpg?w=600&amp;h=450 600w, http://wpmedia.nationalpost.com/2018/02/afp_ys7jj1-e1518713957369.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Timberlake had a little Prince tribute during his Super Bowl performance.</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">With The Tennessee Kids at his side, Timberlake seemed wildly fortified, bolstered by the support of people you could tell believed completely in what he was doing and gave him everything they had to help. This effect and Timberlake\u2019s gratitude for it are in evidence throughout </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Justin Timberlake + the Tennessee Kids</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. The film is a 90-minute testament to Timberlake\u2019s genius \u2014 exquisite as so many of his albums are, it\u2019s plainly as a live performer that he excels most, electrifying the stage in a staggering feat of sustained charisma and jaw-droppingly elaborate choreography. What\u2019s more, it is a document of generosity and affection: the love and care flowing from Timberlake to his band and audience and back again are obvious in every frame. He works hard; he brings out the best in people; people bring out the best in him. What more could we ask of our finest artists? If you want undeniable proof that Timberlake deserves his success, watch this film.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Which brings us back, finally, to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Man of the Woods</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. (We\u2019ll skip past </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The 20/20 Experience Part Two</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, a collection of b-sides thrust into official albumdom by contractual obligation, which lacks by nature the scope and cogency of its engrossing counterpart.) The new record sounds, to the ears of this devoted Timberlake admirer, like a decidedly meagre effort \u2014 not the disaster it\u2019s been characterized as in less forgiving quarters, perhaps, but certainly not the equal of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Justified </span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">or </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">FutureSex/LoveSounds</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. Much of the blame has been (too conveniently) assigned to the album\u2019s prevailing theme: marital bliss, shared by Timberlake and longtime wife Jessica Biel, as multiple songs take pains to insist. Where </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Justified </span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">found Timberlake relishing the demise of a relationship (\u201cCry Me a River\u201d is still one of the best break-up songs ever recorded), and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">FutureSex</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> found him lusting broadly (with sexy results), on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Man of the Woods </span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">he\u2019s just \u2026 serene. Is that why it sounds rather dull?</span></p>\n<ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/music/justin-timberlake-is-set-to-return-to-the-super-bowl-halftime-show-but-what-does-that-mean-for-janet-jackson\">Justin Timberlake is set to return to the Super Bowl halftime show, but what does that mean for Janet Jackson?</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/music/justin-timberlake-announces-new-album-saves-pop-music\">Justin Timberlake announces new album, saves pop music</a></li></ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">It may be true that happiness \u201cwrites write\u201d on the page \u2014 that is, contentment isn\u2019t a strong basis for compelling art. But it\u2019s not that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Man of the Woods </span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">seems blunted by equanimity, not exactly. (In fact, the strongest songs on the album are those that most fully embrace his role as husband and father: both \u201cThe Hard Stuff\u201d and \u201cYoung Man\u201d are rich with earnest sentiment and the wisdom of a maturing man.) The problem seems more that Timberlake \u2014 perhaps too gratified, too comfortable \u2014 has eased off the restless creative energy and adventurousness that made his earlier albums such exhilarating works of mastered charm and omnivorous sonic experimentation. The album fails not as an expression of Timberlake\u2019s satisfaction in life, but as evidence of his satisfaction with music. It lacks the spark of a truly new sound.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Still, is this such a sin? The tradition Timberlake has entered, justly, is that of Michael Jackson (to whom Demme\u2019s film is dedicated) and Prince (to whom he made a much-discussed tribute at the Super Bowl). Jackson and Prince are the twin male luminaries of pop: gods among men, unequivocally. And even Jackson and Prince released mediocre albums \u2014 failures of creative imagination that scarcely damaged their reputations or diminished the full force of their best music. What we ought to keep in mind, sensibly, is that they can\u2019t all be </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Off the Wall </span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">or </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Sign o&#8217; the Times </span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\u2014 they can\u2019t all be </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">FutureSex/LoveSounds </span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">or </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The 20/20 Experience</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. If we conclude, nonetheless, that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Man of the Woods </span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">demands some kind of stock-taking reevaluation, we should comfortably know the answer to the question. How much of Timberlake\u2019s career should we chalk up to fortune, privilege and an essential malleability? Where it counts, very little. </span></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<postmedia:alexa><![CDATA[In defence of Justin Timberlake, (still) a pop genius despite the 'order of the season'.

U.S. sales of OJ increased for the first time in almost five years, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/flu-fears-halt-a-long-decline-in-orange-juice-sales-1518181200\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to <em>the Wall Street Journal</em></a>. However, analysts don\u2019t expect the spike \u2014 0.9 per cent to 38.66 million gallons in the four weeks ending January 20 \u2014 to outlive this year&#8217;s virus.</p>\n<p>Orange juice\u2019s health halo has been slipping, with good reason. With slogans like \u201cStraight from the fruit\u201d and \u201cReally close to fruit,\u201d you\u2019d be forgiven for assuming juice is a reasonably \u201chealthy\u201d alternative to sugary soft drinks. But you\u2019d be wrong.</p>\n<p>A 12-ounce serving of orange juice has 10 teaspoons of sugar, the same as cola. And it\u2019s more calorific, containing 170 calories to cola\u2019s 150 (<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/3/25/11305614/soda-juice-energy-drink-consumption-nutrition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Harvard School of Public Health</a>). In terms of carbohydrates, a small orange juice at McDonald&#8217;s has 34 grams. The same as a bag of M&amp;M&#8217;s (<a href=\"https://www.myfitnesspal.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MyFitnessPal</a>).</p>\n<p>\u201cJuice is sugar water with vitamins. It has drop per drop the same amount of sugar as soda pop and, in some cases, more,\u201d Dr. Yoni Freedhoff, an Ottawa-based obesity specialist, writes on his blog <em><a href=\"http://www.weightymatters.ca/2013/03/juice-is-not-f-fruit.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Weighty Matters</a></em>.</p>\n<p>It was a breakfast table mainstay for decades, but awareness of OJ\u2019s negligible nutritional value is steadily growing. <a href=\"http://citrusindustry.net/2017/09/11/what-is-happening-to-the-orange-juice-market/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nielsen data reveals</a> that the market in the U.S. has plummeted by roughly 50 per cent since 2001, and is expected to continue on its downward trajectory. Motivated by fear of fever, hacking and body aches during one of the worst flu seasons on record, though, people seemingly put faith in its health benefits once again. As a Kansas woman told the<em> Journal</em>: \u201cEvery time (my husband) feels like he is about to get sick, he gets a gallon of cheap orange juice and drinks the whole thing. None of us have had any symptoms of illness.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no scientific evidence to support this home remedy, the U.S. National Institutes of Health reportedly said. But apparently, imagining a link between orange juice and vitamin C-fuelled flu-fighting powers was enough to make people feel protected. Never mind the fact that chili peppers, cauliflower, kale, broccoli and brussels sprouts all have more vitamin C than oranges. You\u2019d be better off just eating an orange. One of the chief issues with juices in general, nutrition experts say, is what they\u2019re missing: dietary fibre.</p>\n<p>\u201cLiquid calories don&#8217;t satiate, and they don&#8217;t pack the fibre and phytonutrients of actual fruit,\u201d Freedhoff explains in a post appropriately titled <a href=\"http://www.weightymatters.ca/2017/12/juice-is-not-fing-fruit-part-ii.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Juice is NOT a F@*#ing Fruit Part II</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Even one serving of juice per day can potentially have a negative impact on health. A 2013 study by the <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/08/reduce-type-2-diabetes-risk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Harvard School of Public Health</a> suggests that while eating enough fruit is beneficial, the inverse is true for juice.</p>\n<p>Researchers found a link between eating at least two servings of whole fruits per week \u2014 especially blueberries, apples and grapes \u2014 and reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. Drinking one or more servings of fruit juice per day, on the other hand, was associated with elevated risk. &#8220;It\u2019s one thing to eat an apple. It\u2019s quite another to drink the juice of three apples, which is easy to do with apple juice,\u201d Marion Nestle, a New York University professor, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/10/28/9626756/fruit-juice-cold-press-eat-fruit-vegetables\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told <em>Vox</em></a> in 2015. \u201cJuices, like any other source of liquid sugars, are best consumed in small amounts.\u201d</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://nationalpost.com/life/food/a-wild-juice-chase-fruit-juices-arent-healthy-eat-a-fruit-instead/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t<postmedia:alexa><![CDATA[Fruit juices aren't healthy.

Some social media users called on the Juno Awards to drop Hedley as a performer at the upcoming show.</p>\n\n<p>The pop-rockers &#8212; fronted by Jacob Hoggard and including Dave Rosin, Tommy Mac and Jay Benison &#8212; are up for three Junos this year including fan choice, group of the year and pop album of the year.</p>\n<p>The band said they &#8220;respect and applaud the #MeToo movement&#8221; and say it is especially important within the music industry, &#8220;which does not exactly have an enviable history of treating women with the respect they deserve.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We appreciate the bravery of those who have come forward with their own stories, and we realize that all of us, as individuals and as a society, can and must do better when it comes to this issue,&#8221; says the statement.</p>\n<p>&#8220;However, if we are to have a meaningful, open and honest discussion, we all have to accept and respect that there are at least two sides to every story. The recent allegations against us posted on social media are simply unsubstantiated and have not been validated. We would hope that people will bear-in-mind the context in which these unsupported accusations have been made before passing judgment on us as individuals or as a band.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The group is currently on tour and was set to perform in Medicine Hat, Alta., on Wednesday evening. They were scheduled to perform in Moose Jaw, Sask., and Brandon, Man., later in the week.</p>\n<p><strong>Full statement by Hedley on sexual misconduct allegations</strong></p>\n<p>All of us in Hedley respect and applaud the #MeToo movement and the open and honest discussion it has inspired. We believe these conversations are particularly important within the music industry, which does not exactly have an enviable history of treating women with the respect they deserve. We appreciate the bravery of those who have come forward with their own stories, and we realize that all of us, as individuals and as a society, can and must do better when it comes to this issue.</p>\n<p>However, if we are to have a meaningful, open and honest discussion, we all have to accept and respect that there are at least two sides to every story.

To that end, as we move forward, we will be evaluating some of our next steps. Hedley\u2019s music should only ever be a positive force, and our performances and personal appearances should continue to be inclusive and safe experiences that bring nothing but joy and happiness to our fans.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/music/newsalert-junos-cancel-hedley-performance-in-wake-of-sexual-misconduct-claims-2/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<postmedia:alexa><![CDATA[Hedley performance dropped from Junos over \u2018unsubstantiated\u2019 sexual misconduct allegations.
