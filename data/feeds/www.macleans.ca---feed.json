After the Second World War, Ottawa was willing to pass surplus military equipment in Europe to allied governments.</p>\n<p>But sales to less reliable countries, and those who might actually use the weapons, always required approval by the full cabinet. Prime Minister Mackenzie King <a href=\"http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/politics-government/cabinet-conclusions/Pages/item.aspx?IdNumber=6285\">noted</a> that \u201cgreat care should be taken with respect to all sales of weapons and supplies of war to foreign governments.\u201d</p>\n<p>The first test came in 1946, when cabinet agreed to sell six million 30-calibre cartridges and four million magazines to the Dutch army just as it was about to embark on a <a href=\"https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/53wqxz/unreleased-indonesian-national-revolution-pics\">colonial war in Indonesia</a>. But when the Dutch asked for 10,000 Sten machine guns for use in Indonesia, Canadian officials turned them down.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have no reason to believe that Canadian public opinion would support such a sale, nor would it be in the Canadian interest to make the sale,\u201d according to one document from the day, now filed at <a href=\"http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/Pages/home.aspx\">Library and Archives Canada</a>.</p>\n<p>Why?</p>\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n<p><div style=\"width: 764px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/205839/original/file-20180211-51713-70q4yd.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" alt=\"\" width=\"754\" height=\"503\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Dutch soldier is seen here questioning Indonesian villagers in this undated photo taken some time between 1945 and 1950. (Creative Commons/Tropenmuseum)</p></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The guns would probably be employed in the \u201c\u2018pacification\u2019 of the native population,\u201d exposing the government to \u201csevere domestic and international criticism for supplying these arms\u201d and potentially \u201cprejudic(ing) for a long time our commercial relations with the Indonesians.\u201d</p>\n<p>Any further talk of helping the Netherlands \u2014 a close Canadian ally \u2014 was blocked by the Department of External Affairs</p>\n<h2>No to China</h2>\n<p>Cabinet did get to decide on a proposal in 1946 to sell warships to China, then a pro-American regime desperately fighting off the advances of Mao Zedong\u2019s Chinese communists.</p>\n<p>The Canadian government certainly sympathized with the Chinese Republicans. And the sale of 10 or 11 surplus Canadian frigates would have netted Canada some $2 million \u2014 the equivalent of $27 million in today\u2019s money. Yet cabinet <a href=\"http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/politics-government/cabinet-conclusions/Pages/item.aspx?IdNumber=7069\">blocked the sale</a> on the grounds that the ships \u201cmight be used in civil warfare.\u201d</p>\n<p>The same logic underpinned a Canadian decision to <a href=\"http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/politics-government/cabinet-conclusions/Pages/item.aspx?IdNumber=8573\">bar all military exports to Chinese Republicans</a> in 1947.</p>\n<p>In both cases, the logic was clear: Canada should sell arms only to close allies, and if there was any likelihood of use against civilians, no sale should be made.</p>\n<h2>Arming a dictatorship: Indonesia</h2>\n<p>By the 1970s, however, Canada had thrown early caution to the winds, becoming a keen seeker of arms exports. A <a href=\"http://lactualite.com/societe/2017/02/05/marchandises-militaires-la-grande-hypocrisie-canadienne/\">recent analysis</a> shows that Canada supplied $5.8 billion worth of arms over the past 25 years to countries classed as \u201cdictatorships\u201d by the human rights group Freedom House.</p>\n<p>The example of arms sales to Indonesia curiously shows both a greater Canadian willingness to sell and the limits to that willingness.</p>\n<p>Indonesia notoriously <a href=\"https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/school-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/timor-companion/invasion\">invaded</a> the former Portuguese colony of East Timor in 1975, with more than <a href=\"https://www.ictj.org/news/10-years-cavr-report-timor-leste-truth\">100,000</a> Timorese perishing under the subsequent military occupation. From 1975 to 1991, Canada nonetheless <a href=\"http://oceanpark.com/notes/books/genocide_in_paradise/genocide_13.htm\">was willing to sell arms</a> to Indonesia.</p>\n<p>Writing in the 1980s, Timorese leader <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-17422094\">Jos\u00e9 Ramos Horta</a> described Canadian \u201cdouble standards\u201d in <a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books?id=WsFVXrVEEekC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=funu+canada&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EnmNlYADLt&amp;sig=zHs9BsZItC39WrWRRCrplqKEL-U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHz8DYrJ_ZAhXwUN8KHSAjCGAQ6AEILzAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">scathing terms</a>: \u201cThese weapons play an important role in the war in East Timor. But how does the Canadian government explain the weapons exports to Indonesia if Canadian law states that export permits should be issued only for \u2018non-conflict\u2019 areas? Simply by asserting that there is no armed conflict in East Timor \u2013 knowing that to be a lie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yet there were limits.</p>\n<p>In 1991, a massacre in East Timor prompted Barbara McDougall, foreign minister in Brian Mulroney\u2019s Progressive Conservative government, <a href=\"http://stopwapenhandel.org/sites/stopwapenhandel.org/files/imported/publicaties/boekenbrochures/Indonesia_0.pdf\">to impose an arms embargo.</a></p>\n<p>There was no suggestion that Canadian-made arms had been used in the massacre, but McDougall was taking no chances.</p>\n<p>Arms sales to Indonesia resumed as <a href=\"https://prism.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/handle/1880/51199/From_Kinshasa_to_Kandahar_2016_chapter04.pdf?sequence=6\">Jean Chr\u00e9tien\u2019s government embraced Indonesia</a>, but there was increasing dissent within the Department of Foreign Affairs about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAny question of military sales to Indonesia, by definition, is a sensitive issue,\u201d one divisional director wrote. After all, he noted acidly, \u201cthe Indonesian army is still killing people in East Timor.\u201d</p>\n<p>In September 1999, after extensive public pressure, foreign minister Lloyd Axworthy imposed an arms embargo as <a href=\"http://www.history.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/u184/robinson/robinson_east_timor_1999_english.pdf\">pro-Indonesia militia groups</a> killed, forcibly relocated and terrorized the Timorese population. No evidence was required that Canadian-supplied weapons were being used against civilians. The government simply acted.</p>\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n<p><div style=\"width: 764px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/205840/original/file-20180211-51700-5cupcw.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" alt=\"\" width=\"754\" height=\"623\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lloyd Axworthy, second from left, is seen here with othelink text r foreign ministers at an emergency ministerial meeting on the East Timor crisis in Auckland, N.Z., in 1999.

It has some way to go before it approaches the standards that once prevailed.</p>\n<p>The arc of Canadian arms sales is long, but it seems to bend away from, not towards, human rights.</p>\n<p><em><a

Poor summer rainfall and spring snow melt have left municipal water reservoirs unfilled.</p>\n<p>This is eerily similar to Cape Town\u2019s situation.</p>\n<p>In 2016, a summer drought led to water restrictions in southern Ontario and Nova Scotia. Last summer, water restrictions were imposed on many southern Alberta communities and farms due to low river flows, and a moratorium on new water licenses has been in place on the South Saskatchewan River Basin in Alberta since 2006. Canadian Geographic declared \u201c<a href=\"https://www.canadiangeographic.ca/article/south-saskatchewan-river-runs-dry\">The South Saskatchewan River Runs Dry</a>\u201d in 2010. The river still flows, but at vastly reduced levels from its natural flow in dry years.</p>\n<h2>A week without winter</h2>\n<p>In Canada, our greatest natural disasters come from <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07011784.2015.1131629\">floods</a>, <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-015-1375-5\">fires</a> and <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-012-1422-0\">droughts</a> \u2014 and they are getting worse as our climate changes. They are wreaking havoc on the infrastructure of our communities and transportation networks, contributing to impoverishment of disadvantaged Canadians, diminishing our natural resources capital, disturbing our ecosystems and reducing agricultural and energy production. Canada needs to be better prepared.</p>\n<p>In 2016, the University of Saskatchewan and three partner universities developed the Global Water Futures (GWF) program to find ways to reduce the impact of these disasters nationally \u2014 and globally.</p>\n<p>This is now the largest university-led water research program in the world, with more than 220 university professors and more than 450 graduate students and researchers involved in the rapid transformation of our measurement, understanding, management and prediction of water resources.</p>\n<p>But <a href=\"http://www.globalwaterfutures.ca\">the GWF findings are distressing</a>: Climate warming from human actions is altering precipitation patterns, reducing snow-packs, accelerating glacier melting, thawing permafrost, degrading water quality, intensifying floods and increasing the risk and extent of droughts.</p>\n<p>In short, Canada is \u201closing its cool.\u201d This matters because our water supplies are dependent upon seasonal or longterm water storage in the form of snow and ice. This makes water from winter snowfalls available in spring and summer when we most acutely need it.</p>\n<p>In mid-January this year, daily high temperatures in all the settled parts of Canada, plus much of the Yukon and Mackenzie Valley, were above freezing. It was a week without winter, a <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/warm-weather-january-1.4488484\">phenomenon that would have been extraordinarily rare</a> in the 20th century.</p>\n<h2>Avoiding a Cape Town in Canada</h2>\n<p>The impacts of this water insecurity are felt by cities, agricultural communities, Indigenous communities and industries \u2014 and are a source of domestic and international tension.</p>\n<p>With such unprecedented change, it is clear that historical patterns of water availability, flooding and drought are no longer a reliable guide for the future.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to understand that bracing for a 100-year storm is maybe going to happen every 10 years now, or every few years,\u201d Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said as he <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-tour-floods-gatineau-1.4109872\">toured the flood zones</a> in Gatineau, Que., in May 2017.</p>\n<p>Yet we are the only G7 country without a national flood-forecasting program.</p>\n<p>How can Canadians avoid our own Cape Town and advance solutions to our own water security problems?</p>\n<p>1) We can start by better integrating and coordinating our water governance, planning and services \u2014 by creating a national capability to forecast floods, droughts, water quality and water supply.</p>\n<p>2) We can work to reduce flood damages through more active and integrated river basin water management, calculating future flood risk and restricting development in future flood zones.</p>\n<p>3) We can reassess our infrastructure, and capability to manage and store water, in expectation of droughts longer and more severe than any experienced.</p>\n<p>4) We can manage the cumulative effects of development in our watersheds to reduce the contamination of our lakes and rivers \u2014 so that the water we have is safe to drink and sustains our aquatic ecosystems.</p>\n<h2>A country of water solutions</h2>\n<p>To achieve these water security goals we need more coordinated, inclusive and effective water governance.</p>\n<p>Right now, the services the government provides to measure, predict and manage water are fragmented into dozens of federal and provincial ministries.</p>\n<p>Indigenous people are left out of water governance and policy decisions, despite their treaty rights and the high exposure of many Indigenous communities to drought, flooding and impaired source water quality.</p>\n<p>If we implement coordinated, integrated water management and prediction in a national water security strategy, this will generate a tremendous advantage for Canada. It will also make us a beacon of good governance to the world in the face of increasing climate change threats.</p>\n<p>Advances in science, prediction, measurement and policy analysis made by the Global Water Futures program, and others, can contribute to making Canadians safer from water disasters. We can be the water-solutions country that others go to for answers to their water problems.</p>\n<p><img

(Getty Images)</p></div>\n<p>It\u2019s midnight and minus 12 outside. Yellow arches and yellower cheese squares are beaming on the menu. Milkshake smell is in the air, and vegetable oil glosses the tables, but ordering food or drink is a convention that many guests can\u2019t afford to observe.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just here to stay warm,\u201d says Richard Dionne, 56, who has lived on the streets of Ottawa for three months. He is hanging out at 2 a.m. on a Tuesday at a McDonald\u2019s on Rideau Street. \u201cBetween midnight and \ufb01ve in the morning, McDonald\u2019s is basically sheltering the frigging homeless,\u201d he points out.</p>\n<p>In winter, Canadians without homes are turning to the home of the Big Mac, pointing to acute shortcomings in housing, income assistance and shelter networks. People with no \ufb01xed address will sit and read books or newspapers for hours, chat or simply sit in the restaurants. At the location on Rideau Street, before other customers complained, homeless people sometimes slept at the tables.</p>\n<p>The Liberal government has vowed to halve homelessness across Canada, but still the number of homeless people (estimated at over 230,000) is two and a half times the workforce of McDonald\u2019s in the country. Some franchises are trying to crack down on loitering, but they stay open 24 hours because night shifts are some of the most pro\ufb01table hours for sales. And for the poorest people in downtown Ottawa, the fast-food restaurant, roofed with headachy lights and 26 surveillance cameras, is the homiest place they\u2019ve got.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/why-calgarys-10-year-bid-to-end-homelessness-was-a-valuable-failure/\">Why Calgary\u2019s 10-year bid to end homelessness was a valuable failure</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThank God for McDonald\u2019s,\u201d says Dionne. \u201cIt has saved people\u2019s lives when it\u2019s minus 40 outside and they have nowhere else to go.\u201d He says it saved his own life during a cold spell in early January. \u201cI have to give kudos to frigging McDonald\u2019s for picking up the slack where the government slacked off.\u201d</p>\n<p>A television in the restaurant broadcasts a town hall with Justin Trudeau, whose government made a campaign promise to create a national poverty reduction plan. \u201cSome people who are homeless will stay in a McDonald\u2019s at night even if there are emergency services available like shelters, often for very good reasons,\u201d says Stephen Gaetz, a professor at York University and director of the Canadian Observatory on Homelessness. \u201cThey might be worried about getting sick and might not like being warehoused with a bunch of other people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shelters often don\u2019t permit people with dogs or other pets, and require couples to split up based on gender. One McDonald\u2019s-goer, James, says he was court-ordered to live at a shelter but wants to avoid other drug users while \ufb01ghting his own addiction. So he spends the night at McDonald\u2019s, sipping Coke and coffee because the dispensers had no more Fruitopia. \u201cI can just sit and be normal,\u201d he says, despite a sign noting a 20-minute seating time limit.</p>\n<p>The \ufb01ve to eight staff who work night shifts on Rideau Street tend to turn a blind eye to the homeless who loiter. One employee, who said he was not permitted to give his name, previously allowed people to sleep in the restaurant until 6 a.m., but customers complained. He says the bathrooms are also now locked at night.</p>\n<p>The issue is not unique to Ottawa. A franchise in downtown Toronto, for example, is similarly busy on a frigid weeknight, and people who work with homeless people in Vancouver are familiar with the McDonald\u2019s habit. The head of\ufb01ce of McDonald\u2019s Canada did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/theres-a-better-way-to-fight-homelessness-than-emergency-shelters/\">There\u2019s a better way to fight homelessness than emergency shelters</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Staying open 24 hours is pro\ufb01table largely because of customers coming in from the bars. The store on Rideau Street did $356 in sales between 1 and 2 a.m. on a recent weeknight, more than any of the hours between 6 a.m. and noon, and the store does around $4,000 in sales in a busy night.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m throwing out all your s&#8211;t!\u201d yelled a man to a woman inside the franchise that never sleeps. He punched the window from outside and later returned before two policemen arrived (the franchise also contracts Shield Security Services).</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say you get a good night\u2019s sleep here,\u201d says Dionne, who used to try for some shut-eye at the tables, \u201cbut people die sleeping outside.\u201d During cold days, many homeless also sleep and spend time at public libraries. In fact, librarians in Vancouver have begun helping people \ufb01nd doctors and apply for social assistance, which is $710 for a single person in British Columbia, and $11 more in Ontario.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat we desperately need is investment in social assistance set at people\u2019s income levels,\u201d says Trish Garner of the B.C. Housing Coalition. When libraries close, people don\u2019t even have places to use the washroom. Shipping containers are being converted into houses in Vancouver, but Garner says the province needs to build 10,000 units per year. Most neighbourhoods, meanwhile, don\u2019t want affordable housing built in their backyards. \u201cReally horri\ufb01c things are being said publicly about homeless people that we wouldn\u2019t allow to be said about anyone else,\u201d says Garner. In reality, one-\ufb01fth of homeless people in the city are employed.</p>\n<p>Dionne used to be a cab driver in northern Ontario, but he became addicted to alcohol and his relationship fell apart. He has a 14-year-old daughter whom he no longer sees. At McDonald\u2019s, \u201cyou meet people and talk, if you\u2019re lonely or something like that, especially during the holidays.\u201d McDonald\u2019s is where he goes at night. It\u2019s even where he went on Christmas Day.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/homelessness/\">HOMELESSNESS</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a

Leader Jagmeet Singh and Chief of Staff, Willy Blomme chat prior to having their portrait taken before the Broadbent Institute&#8217;s Progress Gala in Toronto on Thursday, Nov. 16, 2017. (Christopher Katsarov/CP)</p></div>\n<p>She was meant to be called Anna, a name selected to be recognizable in French and English. Instead, while she was in the womb, her parents starting referring to their baby as baseball player Willie Mays. The nickname clung until kindergarten, when Anna decided she officially preferred her sobriquet and that her name would be Willy with a &#8220;Y.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Blomme was brought on board by NDP leader Jagmeet Singh to be his chief of staff. She had written speeches for Jack Layton and brought Valerie Plante into the Montreal mayoral race before leading Singh\u2019s campaign, but there was no certainty she would accept the job of chief of staff, as a 36-year-old academic with other career options.</p>\n<p>She studied in the Ivy League, expanded the Broadbent Institute into Quebec and\u2014based on her PhD thesis and a recently authored book\u2014is professionally obsessed with winter. \u201cWinters in Toronto weren\u2019t cold enough for me,\u201d says Blomme, who grew up in Toronto, lived in Montreal and moved to Ottawa in January for her new role.</p>\n<p>Blomme wrote her PhD thesis at Johns Hopkins University and will publish a book (this winter) arguing that climate change threatens the Canadian sense of belonging\u2014\u201coutdoor skating rinks are under threat,\u201d she says. No specific moment triggered her love for the season; rather, she was innately enthused by snowbanks. In winter, she marvels, \u201cyou hear your footsteps when you\u2019re walking down the street, or you know in a fresh snowfall, you hear the hum of electricity lines.\u201d</p>\n<p>The hum of party lines now fills her ears in Ottawa. Critics worry Singh\u2019s team is inexperienced, though Blomme is an exception to that. She notes some of Layton&#8217;s staff, including his photographer, have joined Singh\u2019s team. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a marrying of those two worlds, and I\u2019m kind of lucky that I know folks on both sides,\u201d Blomme says.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/jagmeet-singh-dodges-questions-about-alberta-and-b-c-pipeline-fight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jagmeet Singh tries not to pick sides on the Alberta and B.C. pipeline fight</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Blomme also knows both sides of French and English Canada. Although she was born to Anglophones in Winnipeg, she became bilingual in French schools in Toronto. On the campaign trail with Singh, she was the driver behind his Montreal rallies and his surprising visit to Alma, Que., a separatist region where Singh said he would respect Quebec&#8217;s decision to separate if Quebecers voted to do so.</p>\n<p>Since Singh was travelling too much during the campaign to attend a regular French course, Blomme and certain friends of hers served as informal French tutors, speaking with him in person or on the phone each day in his third language (his second being Punjabi).</p>\n<p>Among Blomme\u2019s closest friends on the campaign was Dave Weatherall, Layton\u2019s former photographer and now Singh\u2019s deputy director of communications. Blomme spoke in French at his wedding.</p>\n<p>When Blomme was in a political science class at McGill and played the role of the World Bank in a mock exercise, \u201cshe was just like a strategic mastermind,\u201d says her friend Mohini Datta-Ray, who runs a women\u2019s shelter in New York. Blomme stays behind the scenes even as social media talks about her. \u201cAre you going to get Twitter now that you\u2019re trending?\u201d asked Datta-Ray, recalling that Blomme replied, \u201cnope.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Blomme visits Datta-Ray&#8217;s home, she tends to show up with her favourite snack: two grapefruits and a bitter chocolate bar. \u201cShe can make friends with a rock, and make that rock feel like the most special rock in the world,\u201d says Datta-Ray. Before she was offered the job of chief of staff, she had other career routes available to her but made a principled decision, her friend says. \u201cIt\u2019s a once-in-a-moment, where the world is seemingly marching to the right everywhere else,\u201d says Datta-Ray. \u201cThis is not just a crucial move for the NDP, but this is a critical move for the discourse of the country.\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>***</strong></p>\n<p>Since infancy, Blomme has adored the cold. The April after she was born, she kicked off the blankets in her crib. \u201cI even thought she looked slightly blueish,\u201d says her mother, Sheila McCook.</p>\n<p>Blomme started attending rallies, such as one against the Gulf War, with her parents, who worked for the CBC and her father later with Greenpeace. \u201cShe didn\u2019t look quite like the other kids,\u201d says McCook, who once spotted a group of children walking up the street in shorts, including one girl robed in sequins gifted from a family friend in the middle east. \u201cIt was Willy in an Afghan wedding dress.\u201d</p>\n<p>Junior high school was Blomme\u2019s age of peculiar hats. Her grandparents briefly lived in Nigeria and sent her decorative hats, which Blomme thought she should wear, so she showed up in seventh grade with her head dressed in purple embroidery or a skunk-coloured toque with streamers of fabric dangling down her back. \u201cSo, about your hats,\u201d said the teacher at the end of the year, as her mother recalls. \u201cIs it for religious reasons, I guess?\u201d</p>\n<p>At age 19, Blomme ran unsuccessfully as an NDP candidate in 2000 (handing in a history paper on the day of the election), and took off a semester to work on Jack Layton\u2019s leadership campaign. Later, she worked as one of his speechwriters in Ottawa, and Layton on the road would call her and download his thoughts and anecdotes to her as she typed notes and crafted a speech. Their best work together was the apology for the victims of residential schools. \u201cI was really proud that he was the only one who used the word &#8216;racist&#8217; to talk about the residential school system,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Layton\u2019s son phoned Blomme the morning before he made his speech about love, hope and optimism. She was in Baltimore, and she returned to Toronto for the funeral, showing up unannounced at her parents\u2019 house around 2am. During the dress rehearsal, the team tried to busy themselves. \u201cIt was oddly a bit like a campaign office,\u201d she recalls. \u201cYou could cry through your work.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blomme\u2019s own father died from cancer in 2016. While living in Amsterdam with her mother, he was on a work trip to Tokyo and lost feeling in his legs. He died in the hospital in Toronto. Blomme still wears his wool socks and sweaters.</p>\n<p>Blomme later was the director of Val\u00e9rie Plante\u2019s campaign to become the leader of Projet Montr\u00e9al. Plante became best known for her proposal for a new subway line, which the team originally called \u201cthe diagonal line\u201d because it cut across the city. On the published graphic, the line appeared pink, and people started referring to it by its colour. \u201cI would never brand the feminine candidate with pink,\u201d says Blomme. However, \u201cwe decided to champion it.\u201d</p>\n<p>She returned to her role as Quebec director of the Broadbent Institute, a think tank that does research on the green economy, income inequality and democratic reform. She hesitated to leave that role, but she went onto become a close friend of Singh. After he launched his campaign in Toronto, he stayed at her apartment in Montreal, and she recalls sitting with him on a rocking bench on her balcony at 1am, with his brother in a Muskoka chair.</p>\n<p>Singh has tried to become familiar by touring the provinces since October, and Blomme says his challenge will be &#8220;capitalizing on that while also having a strong presence in Ottawa.&#8221; Blomme has now moved into an apartment downtown near Elgin Street with a gym, pool and grocery store. It&#8217;s the first time she&#8217;s looked to live in a high rise. &#8220;The convenience of it makes sense for this life that I&#8217;m embarking on.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/jagmeet-singh/\">JAGMEET SINGH</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-outsiders-behind-jagmeet-singh-and-the-new-ndp/\">The outsiders behind Jagmeet Singh and the new NDP</a></strong></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/jagmeet-singhs-rookie-blunders/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Jagmeet Singh\u2019s rookie blunders</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/jagmeet-singh-and-the-shunning-of-parliament/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Jagmeet Singh and the shunning of Parliament</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/canadians-feel-trudeaus-image-on-the-world-stage-is-his-biggest-asset-poll/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Canadians feel Trudeau\u2019s image on the world stage is his biggest asset: Poll</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/jagmeet-singh-on-his-path-to-the-prime-ministers-office/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Jagmeet Singh on his path to the prime minister\u2019s office</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/if-the-economy-is-so-great-why-do-we-feel-so-bad/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>If the economy is so great, why do we feel so bad?</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/jagmeet-singh-and-the-rise-of-a-unique-brand-of-sikh-politics/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Jagmeet Singh and the rise of a new brand of Sikh politics</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/its-time-for-the-ndp-to-end-its-ideological-loyalty-test/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>It\u2019s time for the NDP to end its ideological loyalty test</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/how-willy-blomme-became-jagmeet-singhs-indispensible-chief-of-staff/\">How Willy Blomme became Jagmeet Singh&#8217;s indispensable chief of staff</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/how-willy-blomme-became-jagmeet-singhs-indispensible-chief-of-staff/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Patrick Brown enters Ontario PC leadership race: video</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/news/patrick-brown-enters-ontario-pc-leadership-race/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/news/patrick-brown-enters-ontario-pc-leadership-race/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 21:38:56 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[The Canadian Press]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[2018 Ontario election]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Kathleen Wynne]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ontario PC leadership race]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Patrick Brown]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1101005</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Brown previously stepped down as PC Party leader amid sexual-misconduct allegations, which he has denied</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/patrick-brown-enters-ontario-pc-leadership-race/\">Patrick Brown enters Ontario PC leadership race: video</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[\t\t<div class=\"bc-video bc-video-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"player-loader\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n\t\t\t<iframe src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/video/iframe/13639244001/VJjIBwmqg/5735390647001\"\n\t\t\t\twidth=\"640\"\n\t\t\t\theight=\"360\"\n\t\t\t\tallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tmozallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"width: 100%;

He has also vowed to sue CTV News, which broadcast the allegations. CTV has said it stands by its reporting.</p>\n<p>He said Friday he believes his name has been cleared.</p>\n<p>Four other candidates\u2014former Tory legislator Christine Elliott, Toronto lawyer and businesswoman Caroline Mulroney, former Toronto city councillor Doug Ford and social conservative advocate Tanya Granic Allen\u2014are already competing to be party leader.</p>\n<p>Mulroney and Ford said Brown joining the race is pulling attention away from what should be the party&#8217;s real objectives\u2014defeating the Liberals.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/patrick-browns-downfall-goes-far-beyond-politics/\">Patrick Brown\u2019s downfall goes far beyond politics</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;Patrick Brown made the right decision to step down.

(Gerald Herbert/AP)</p></div>\n<p>It seemed pretty clear, shortly after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School \u00a0in Newtown, Conn., that America does not have a bottom to hit. If a man killing 20 first-graders, six of the school\u2019s staff and his own mother doesn\u2019t make a nation do something about their gun problem\u2014and indeed, nothing was done\u2014it\u2019s difficult to believe that anything ever will be.</p>\n<p>Wednesday\u2019s attack by a man armed with AR-15 rifle on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., left 17 dead, a number that authorities say could rise.

It was a gunman in all the other schools, and in Pulse nightclub, where 49 people were killed and 58 were wounded. It was an also-a-gunman on <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/how-las-vegas-shooting-victim-jordan-mcildoon-didnt-die-alone/\">the Las Vegas strip</a> who killed 58 people and injured 851 by firing into a country music festival\u2014but had it been a flower girl no one would be dead.

But it\u2019s worth imagining the outcry that would have occurred had he been denied the right to purchase an AR-15 rifle based on any or all of the above. On Friday, the FBI <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/article200523359.html\">issued a statement</a> apologizing for failing to act on a Jan. 5 tip that the man now in custody was behaving erratically and may have been planning a school shooting. At that point, he already had a gun.</p>\n<p>Yes, it should have been more difficult to get a gun, but very likely only because it should be more difficult for <em>everyone</em> to get a gun.

On the evening of the killings, he had 24 firearms in his hotel suite, 14 of which were .223-caliber AR-15-type semi-automatic rifles; a large quantity of ammunition and numerous high-capacity magazines were also found. Yet part of the response to those murders was concern for the feelings of other Americans who might have similar arsenals kicking about. My sympathy is limited. There is simply no reason to stockpile automatic weapons unless you\u2019re planning to kill people.

Well, let me put it this way. Both my children collect and play board games. They are responsible board game owners. They carefully punch out cardboard tokens without fraying the edges; they store all their cards in secure protective sleeves. It seems like someone is always \u201csleeving\u201d around here, and we take a lot of pleasure from this pastime.</p>\n<p>However, if it came to light that all across the country, on a regular basis, large groups of children were being cut to ribbons by deadly playing cards, crushed beneath murderous mounted map boards, or having their skulls cracked by high-velocity dice, my family would understand the need for some restrictions on our hobby.</p>\n<p>Maybe these restrictions would mean that my kids would have to keep their games at a properly licensed Friendly Local Game Store, or be required to register anything featuring a combat results table, or be unable to buy games online. A mandated 14-day waiting period before purchasing <em>Twilight Struggle</em> might be put in place. If, during that two-week period, a dangerous criminal were to break into our house in the middle of the night demanding \u201ca tightly crafted consim game rated no less than 8 on <a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12333/twilight-struggle\">BoardGameGeek</a> demonstrating the futility of nuclear war, or your life,\u201d that might prove highly inconvenient\u2014but we\u2019d <em>Risk</em> it.</p>\n<p>Oh, I know what you\u2019re thinking: a board game won\u2019t keep you safe. Well, odds are, neither will a<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2759797/\"> gun</a>. While having a copy of <em>Diplomacy</em> in your house may ruin friendships, it won\u2019t make the lives of those in your family significantly more <a href=\"https://www.minnpost.com/second-opinion/2012/12/health-risk-having-gun-home\">dangerous</a> than the lives of your board-gameless neighbours, unlike a gun.</p>\n<p>I understand my eldest would fully support a total ban on <em>Betrayal at the House on the Hill, </em>and I\u2019d certainly appreciate legislation requiring that all board games be stored in a secure safe, and not all over the dining room table. Still, it\u2019s possible that necessary restrictions might take <em>some</em> of the joy out of responsible board game ownership. Maybe so much so that a few people would decide to just take up philately instead. That would hardly be the end of the world, for anyone.</p>\n<h3>MORE ABOUT <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/gun-control/\">GUN CONTROL</a>:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/the-nra-is-wrong-real-life-is-not-an-action-movie/\">The NRA is wrong: Real life is not an action movie</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/something-is-broken-in-the-united-states/\">Something is broken in the United States</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/why-country-music-needs-to-speak-up-about-gun-control/\">Why country music needs to speak up about gun control</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/after-las-vegas-terror-gop-lawmakers-hem-and-haw/\">After Las Vegas terror, GOP lawmakers hem and haw</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/house-adjourns-after-round-the-clock-sit-in-on-gun-control/\">Democrats stage round-the-clock sit-in on gun control</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/rebellious-democrats-disrupt-house-stage-protest-over-gun-control-vote/\">Rebellious Democrats disrupt House, stage protest over gun control vote</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/on-domestic-attacks-as-a-new-fixture-of-american-life/\">On domestic attacks as a new fixture of American life</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/how-america-armed-itself/\">How America armed itself</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/another-school-shooting-in-america-and-all-the-nonsense-that-will-be-said/\">Another school shooting in America, and all the nonsense that will be said</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/another-school-shooting-in-america-and-all-the-nonsense-that-will-be-said/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>13</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Patrick Brown removed from Ontario PC caucus</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/news/patrick-brown-removed-from-ontario-pc-caucus/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/news/patrick-brown-removed-from-ontario-pc-caucus/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 18:18:36 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[The Canadian Press]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[2018 Ontario election]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ontario Progressive Conservative]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Patrick Brown]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1100889</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Interim leader Vic Fedeli had previously asked Brown to take a leave as Brown dealt with allegations of sexual misconduct</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/patrick-brown-removed-from-ontario-pc-caucus/\">Patrick Brown removed from Ontario PC caucus</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_1100675\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1100675\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CITY_BROWN_POST.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"822\" height=\"462\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CITY_BROWN_POST.jpg 822w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CITY_BROWN_POST-300x168.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CITY_BROWN_POST-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CITY_BROWN_POST-600x336.jpg 600w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CITY_BROWN_POST-375x211.jpg 375w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CITY_BROWN_POST-111x63.jpg 111w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ontario Progressive Conservative Leader Patrick Brown leaves Queen&#8217;s Park after a news conference in Toronto on Wednesday, Jan. 24, 2018.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Liam Richards</p></div>\n<p>The death of a child is one of the most shattering events a person can endure. Debbie Baptiste lost her 22-year-old son Colten Boushie in August 2016 in horrible, violent manner.

That was just the beginning of the cruelty and injustice Baptiste would face: A campaign of anti-Indigenous hatred on social media and in comments on news stories about the case. A trial in which Stanley\u2019s lawyer blocked every visibly Indigenous person from serving as a juror.

Less than 48 hours after the jury returned its verdict in the Stanley trial, she and her family flew to Ottawa to meet with federal ministers and the prime minister to advocate for change in the political and justice systems.

Parents in remote communities fear sending their children to larger centres for educational opportunities, after a string of suspicious deaths of several young people attending high school in Thunder Bay. \u201cOur kids\u2019 gymnasium should not be a funeral home,\u201d Nishnawbe Aski Nation Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/thenational/deer-lake-high-school-thunder-bay-1.4389945\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told the CBC</a>\u00a0after a crisis meeting called to address the deaths. \u201cI just remember sitting there and thinking, this isn\u2019t right \u2026 that we\u2019re burying children.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-colten-boushie-case-and-a-possible-quick-fix-for-the-legal-system/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Colten Boushie case and a possible \u2018quick fix\u2019 for the legal system</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Another pervasive danger to young Indigenous people\u2019s lives is the perception that they are a threat. When Colten and his friends drove onto Stanley\u2019s property, the farmer grabbed a hammer and loaded his gun. The Mounties who later searched Baptiste\u2019s home appeared to consider Colten more as a suspect than a victim. Even some media coverage seemed to agree with this perspective, referring to the \u201cColten Boushie trial\u201d rather than accurately calling it the \u201cGerald Stanley trial.\u201d (Similarly, the\u00a0<em>Globe and Mail</em>\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/even-after-death-canada-denies-tina-fontaine-dignity/article37821254/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recently ran a headline</a>\u00a0about the trial of Raymond Cormier, the man accused of killing 15-year-old Tina Fontaine in Winnipeg in 2014, that highlighted the girl\u2019s substance use \u2014 as if somehow it was her behaviour that should be under scrutiny.)</p>\n<p>This racially biased victim-blaming and assumption of criminality is rampant. A 2017\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/racial-profiling-report-1.4097377\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a>\u00a0from the Ontario Human Rights Commission found that constant scrutiny from store clerks, police and public servants leaves many racialized and Indigenous people feeling mistrustful and unsafe. \u201cRacial profiling is a daily reality that damages communities and undermines trust in public institutions,\u201d the report concluded.</p>\n<p>Parents of Indigenous children who fear that their children are unsafe and won\u2019t be treated fairly by police and other authority figures have good reason. School administrators are more likely to suspend and expel Indigenous and other racialized children. Police are more likely to confront and arrest them. Just this week,\u00a0<a href=\"http://aptnnews.ca/2018/02/15/rcmp-facebook-group-claims-colten-boushie-got-deserved/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">APTN News reported on a message</a>\u00a0about Colten Boushie posted to a private Facebook group for Mounties. It read, \u201cToo bad the kid died but he got what he deserved.\u201d</p>\n<p>My son is Oji-Cree and Ojibway. He\u2019s not that much younger than Colten was when he was killed, and Colten\u2019s death and the trial of Stanley have struck close to home. Our son has been told to be cautious of authority figures and careful around police. When he leaves the house, there\u2019s always a small catch of anxiety for me. There have been too many encounters that have exposed people\u2019s biases and prejudice: the coach who singled him out for punishment when he was part of a group of boys (the rest of them white) caught goofing around and roughhousing in a locker room; the teacher who threatened to call the police when he got in a fight in middle school; the shop keeper who hovered near him in a toy store until I intervened; the bus driver who screamed at him for going in the wrong door.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/canadas-long-road-to-the-colten-boushie-verdict/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Canada\u2019s long road to the Colten Boushie verdict</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Sometimes I think I\u2019m paranoid, that I\u2019m reading racism into every encounter. But then I consider the violence of Gerald Stanley, the jury who acquitted him, the violent racist vitriol that has been directed at Indigenous people online during the trial and its aftermath, and the Mountie who believed Colten \u201cgot what he deserved.\u201d I\u2019m frightened of what some dangerous, armed stranger could think my son deserves one day.</p>\n<p>Colten\u2019s family says he was funny, gentle, hard-working and considerate. He loved his Cree culture and he loved his family. He liked basketball and dreamed of being a firefighter. All that potential is gone, while the man who ended his life walks free. In her meeting with Justin Trudeau, Baptiste showed the prime minister letters she has received since her son\u2019s death. One came from a group of children on a Saskatchewan reserve. They\u2019re confused as to why someone who had acknowledged killing her son was not sent to prison.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know how to explain this my son either. I don\u2019t know how any parent of a child of any race can explain Colten\u2019s death and the outcome of Stanley\u2019s trial to them with anything but anger at this injustice and shame over Canada\u2019s continued mistreatment of Indigenous people.</p>\n<p>Colten\u2019s family\u2019s advocacy, however, has not been in vain. The federal government just announced a new legal framework to foster self-government. It\u2019s a start, but as with all government promises regarding reconciliation and Indigenous rights, ensuring it happens requires vigilance.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Colten\u2019s family seems to have found a small bit of peace. \u201cOur voices have been made a priority here and we feel like we are finally being heard,\u201d Colton\u2019s cousin Jade Tootoosis said after speaking with government ministers. \u201cColten is not able to stand with us physically so we stand here for him. We speak for him and we will continue to do that.\u201d</p>\n<h3>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/colten-boushie/\">COLTEN BOUSHIE</a>:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/what-could-reform-look-like-after-the-fury-over-the-stanley-acquittal/\">What could reform look like, after the fury over the Stanley acquittal?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/what-political-leaders-said-about-the-gerald-stanley-verdict/\">What political leaders said about the Gerald Stanley verdict</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-colten-boushie-case-and-a-possible-quick-fix-for-the-legal-system/\">The Colten Boushie case and a possible \u2018quick fix\u2019 for the legal system</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/gerald-stanley-trial-aftermath-how-to-avoid-appointing-all-white-juries/\">Gerald Stanley trial aftermath: How to avoid appointing all-white juries</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/canadas-long-road-to-the-colten-boushie-verdict/\">Canada\u2019s long road to the Colten Boushie verdict</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/the-gerald-stanley-verdict-is-a-blow-to-reconciliation-and-a-terrifying-one-at-that/\">The Gerald Stanley verdict is a blow to reconciliation\u2014and a terrifying one at that</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/no-rural-prairie-dwellers-you-cant-shoot-to-protect-your-property/\">No, rural Prairie dwellers, you can\u2019t shoot to protect your property</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/in-saskatchewan-a-high-profile-trials-jury-selection-reveals-a-legal-injustice/\">In Saskatchewan, a trial\u2019s jury selection reveals a legal injustice</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/why-has-colten-boushies-mother-had-to-work-so-hard-just-to-prove-her-sons-humanity/\">Why has Colten Boushie\u2019s mother had to work so hard just to prove her son&#8217;s humanity?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/why-has-colten-boushies-mother-had-to-work-so-hard-just-to-prove-her-sons-humanity/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>12</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Caroline Mulroney passes her first test at the PCs&#8217; opening debate</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/caroline-mulroney-passes-her-first-test-at-the-pcs-opening-debate/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/caroline-mulroney-passes-her-first-test-at-the-pcs-opening-debate/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 17:22:43 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jen Gerson]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ontario PC leadership race]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ontario PCs]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1100821</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Opinion: The first Ontario PC leadership debate was a bit of a bust\u2014but the rookie candidate showed signs that she could win the party's top job</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/caroline-mulroney-passes-her-first-test-at-the-pcs-opening-debate/\">Caroline Mulroney passes her first test at the PCs&#8217; opening debate</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_1100845\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1100845\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_GERSON_POST.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"822\" height=\"548\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_GERSON_POST.jpeg 822w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_GERSON_POST-300x200.jpeg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_GERSON_POST-768x512.jpeg 768w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_GERSON_POST-375x250.jpeg 375w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_GERSON_POST-325x217.jpeg 325w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">PC Ontario Leadership candidate Caroline Mulroney scrums with journalists in the TVO studios in Toronto on Thursday, February 15, 2018, following a televised debate with fellow candidates Christine Elliott, Tanya Granic Allen and Doug Ford. (Chris Young/CP)</p></div>\n<p>There are four people running to be the leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party, and two of them have a good chance to win, if their performance in the first &#8220;debate&#8221;\u2014more of a gathering of friendly rivals hosted by TVO&#8217;s Steve Paikin on Thursday\u2014can be any fair measure.</p>\n<p>Feel free to skip the debate in its entirety. As Paikin himself almost conceded at its outset, it was less of a debate and more of a job interview\u2014and it felt about as interesting as one. (Hug a human resources professional, folks.)</p>\n<p>There was little disagreement between the candidates\u2014 Caroline Mulroney, Christine Elliott, Doug Ford and Tanya Granic Allen\u2014and little veering from talking points. No one embarrassed him or herself, nor did they embarrass a party that is already doing everything possible to staunch the grease fire of former leader Patrick Brown, who helpfully decided to launch his redemption tour just ahead of the debate.</p>\n<p>The poorly prepared Doug Ford was ill-versed on policy, and he lacks the easy charisma of his late brother, Rob\u2014but he also didn&#8217;t come across as an unstable or chaotic future leader.</p>\n<p>Longshot candidate Granic Allen, who had the least to lose, was by far the most fun to watch, lamenting that &#8220;anal sex&#8221; was taught in the Liberal sex education curriculum and castigating Brown for the &#8220;corruption&#8221; that had taken hold in his party under his leadership.</p>\n<p>It would be easy to write her off entirely as a distraction\u2014but given that she was able to raise the $100,000 entry fee to the leadership race through donations, and these wild political times, who knows?</p>\n<p>Elliott, a former MLA and the widow of late federal finance minister Jim Flaherty, is attempting a leadership run for the third time. The debate allowed her to demonstrate her finer grasp of provincial policy. But neither elections nor leadership races are generally won by a test of which candidate can best recite the platform. Elliott is a credible potential leader, but she&#8217;s not terribly sparkly and, worse, already branded with the scarlet L.</p>\n<p>But most eyes were on Mulroney, who is branding herself as the generational change many Ontarians are hoping to see at Queen&#8217;s Park. However, although the daughter of former prime minister Brian Mulroney could mark the establishment of a political dynasty, she has never been elected to office. This debate represented her first major public test.</p>\n<p>Youthful and poised, it was not difficult to picture her as a premier\u2014though the format of the debate made it impossible to guess how she will hold up in a real debate against a more experienced rival like Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne.</p>\n<p>On most policy matters, the candidates were aligned\u2014expressing trepidation on minimum wage increases and marijuana policies\u2014and they abandoned substantive chunks of the policy platform that the party had spent 18 months writing and branding around Brown. All\u00a0of the candidates, for example, opposed the carbon tax Brown was in favour of, prompting Paikin to challenge them to find ways to fund their platform&#8217;s promises absent a now-nixed revenue stream.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One thing that we would do is a value-for-money audit,&#8221; Elliott said. &#8220;I want to audit Kathleen Wynne&#8217;s economic mess that she has made of Ontario. We can find millions of dollars of savings there.&#8221; Look at the money the Liberals wasted, she added, making the obligatory partisan nods toward the gas plant and e-health scandals. &#8220;We can find those savings.&#8221; Mulroney re-iterated Elliott&#8217;s position on the audit, tapping the reliable well of &#8220;culture of waste at Queen&#8217;s Park.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This conformity is a bit baffling. The federal government has threatened to impose carbon taxes on provinces that fail to enact their own climate change policies. This should make this policy a political shruggie for potential premiers.</p>\n<p>Ford, meanwhile, promised to take the federal government to court over the matter. This is empty bluster. Manitoba has already sought a legal opinion on the matter, and scholars decided the federal government was within its rights to impose a carbon tax\u2014so it was better, Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister decided, for the province to just do it in house and keep the tax revenues themselves.</p>\n<p>Who knows what an actual judge might decide, of course\u2014but wouldn&#8217;t it make more sense to offset other taxes instead of fighting an inevitable one? This was an opportunity for Mulroney to set herself apart on a major policy plank that would have maintained the optical integrity of the People&#8217;s Guarantee, the party&#8217;s platform under Brown. It was an opportunity missed.</p>\n<p>She followed with a measured statement about the province&#8217;s contentious sex-ed curriculum, saying that while parents hadn&#8217;t been adequately consulted, she would leave it untouched. This will alienate some social conservatives, but does have the benefit of eliding old culture-war battles that Wynne could use to her obvious advantage against a conservative party.</p>\n<p>Ironically, where Mulroney was at her strongest\u2014the moment at which she seemed most ready for the position she is seeking \u2014was when she answered to her biggest weakness: that she lacks political experience.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Kathleen Wynne has a lot of political experience and that has gotten the province into the situation that we&#8217;re in today,&#8221; she said. Referring to her fellow candidates, and noting that she was the only one who had actually won a nomination for the coming election, she added: &#8220;Nobody here put their name forward and thought that was important until the top job became available.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What people are looking for is something different. They want a new approach to politics\u2014they don&#8217;t want a career politician.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mulroney herself couldn&#8217;t have plotted out this ambitious political arc. But if she is going to win this, she needs a mastery of talking points and policy. She will also need the ability to recover from a rhetorical hit, and to deliver one. It was impossible to gauge how well she could do either from this debate; that&#8217;s a skill that requires a kind of confidence in the limelight that can only be earned with practice. She would be a much easier pick for leader after only a few years in office.</p>\n<p>However, if the coming election hinges on a question of an unpopular Wynne against an unseasoned Mulroney, that&#8217;s a frame the Ontario PCs stand a good chance of winning. After all, for as much as people don&#8217;t know about Mulroney, there is no point in voting for someone you already know you don&#8217;t like.</p>\n<h3>MORE ABOUT <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/ontario-pcs/\">ONTARIO PCS</a>:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ontario-progressive-conservative-leadership-debate-live-video/\">Ontario PC leadership debate: Watch it here</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/the-ontario-pc-party-needs-a-woman-to-take-charge/\">The Ontario PC Party needs a woman to take charge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/patrick-brown-downfall-whats-next-for-the-ontario-pcs/\">Patrick Brown downfall: What\u2019s next for the Ontario PCs?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/caroline-mulroney-the-anti-trudeau-enters-the-political-fray/\">Caroline Mulroney, the anti-Trudeau, enters the political fray</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/former-pc-leader-tim-hudak-will-resign-as-mpp/\">Former PC leader Tim Hudak will resign as MPP</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/ontario-conservative-mpp-jack-maclaren-website-testimonials-improper/\">Ontario Conservative MPP Jack MacLaren: Website testimonials \u2018improper\u2019</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/ontario-pc-leader-denounces-caucus-members-mysogynist-joke/\">Ontario PC leader denounces caucus member\u2019s misogynist \u2018joke\u2019</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/tory-blue-goes-green-ontario-pcs-make-a-plan-for-carbon-pricing-and-renewal/\">Ontario PCs make a plan for carbon pricing, and renewal</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/caroline-mulroney-passes-her-first-test-at-the-pcs-opening-debate/\">Caroline Mulroney passes her first test at the PCs&#8217;

Far from being the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/062.nsf/vwapj/InnovationNation_Report-EN.pdf/$file/InnovationNation_Report-EN.pdf\">nation of innovators</a>\u201d so often touted by Justin Trudeau&#8217;s Liberal government, the <em>Bloomberg</em> report is a stark reminder of one simple fact that negatively impacts a lot more than just jobs: our country is suffering from an innovation crisis, and it\u2019s getting worse every year.</p>\n<p>The <em>Bloomberg</em> ranking is based on seven \u201cinnovation-related\u201d criteria, including R&amp;D intensity, patent activity, and tech density. At number 22, Canada is one of only two G7 nations\u2014along with Italy\u2014that fail to make what <em>Bloomberg</em> calls the \u201ctop-tier,\u201d which includes the Nordic countries, the remaining G7 economies, and other economic powerhouses such as Singapore, Australia, and South Korea. When you consider that the overall innovation score assigned to each country puts Canada only marginally ahead of Russia, the extent to which the Canadian economy is behind in this area is striking. In some cases, diving into the data makes the situation seem even worse. For instance, in terms of \u201ctertiary efficiency,\u201d a measure that combines several individual indicators related to post-secondary education, Canada crashes in at number 45, just a few spots ahead of South Africa and Morocco. In fact, the only criterion in which Canada breaks into the top-tier is concentration of R&amp;D researchers, and even then we fail to make the top ten.</p>\n<p>And the worst thing? Canada has fallen two spots since last year.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/innovative-science-research-in-canada-is-dying-a-silent-death/\">Innovative science research in Canada is dying a silent death</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>If you\u2019re skeptical about an \u201cinnovation index\u201d meaning much in a practical sense, then consider this: in terms of productivity (measured by GDP per hour worked), Canada ranks far below the G7 average\u2014a staggering 12 per cent below, in fact\u2014and only marginally above that of the broader OECD. Widely considered to be a key outgrowth of an innovative economy, and undoubtedly a key ingredient in helping to foster future innovation, productivity is also one of the <em>Bloomberg</em> index\u2019s seven criteria.</p>\n<p>The result of Canada\u2019s low level of productivity is, among other things, a relative weakness in GDP per capita, as compared with other members of the G7 and OECD. Measured in this capacity, Canada has been underperforming other advanced economies since at least the 1980s, and even more so since the 1990s, according to the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.conferenceboard.ca/hcp/Details/Economy/income-per-capita.aspx\">Conference Board of Canada.</a> In 1970, Canada\u2019s GDP per capita was nearly 6 per cent higher than the G7 average; today, it is 4 per cent lower. In fact, between 1980 and 2012, the GDP per capita gap between Canada and the U.S. tripled, and Americans now enjoy a 16 per cent higher rate in relative terms.</p>\n<p>More than the loss of 88,000 jobs, this relatively unproductive workforce is the real face of Canada\u2019s innovation crisis.</p>\n<p>The solution to this mess is not an easy one. Technology advocates might suggest that the country\u2019s firms would benefit from better access to growth capital, while municipal politicians might say that it\u2019s all about an endemic and enduring lack of investment in key public infrastructure projects. Social-justice advocates (including our prime minister) will point to the need for \u201cinclusive growth\u201d\u2014incorporating more women, Indigenous groups, and visible minority populations into the workforce. Undoubtedly these points are all relevant, but the problem is complex and requires much more than one simple policy prescription.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/how-to-fix-canadas-innovation-conundrum/\">How to fix Canada&#8217;s innovation conundrum</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately, the current government\u2019s solutions have mostly involved doing the one thing that is most unlikely to foster innovation: adding a more robust and activist role for Ottawa. In its\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.budget.gc.ca/aceg-ccce/pdf/pathway-to-prosperity-eng.pdf\">third and final report</a>, released this past December, Trudeau\u2019s much-celebrated \u201cAdvisory Council on Economic Growth\u201d summarized its eight recommendations for \u201cresetting Canada\u2019s growth trajectory.\u201d Of these, fully half involve creating a new governmental or quasi-governmental agency (such as the Canada Infrastructure Bank), while the remaining are so ambiguous as to be potentially meaningless (for example, creating a foreign direct investment strategy \u201cin line with the country\u2019s economic growth strategy\u201d). The fact that the Liberals have already given the green light to several of these recommendations suggests that the Trudeau government has every intention of making good on the Advisory Council\u2019s recommendations.</p>\n<p>Ottawa\u2019s \u201cInnovation Supercluster Initiative,\u201d which will see the federal government invest nearly $1 billion to create five separate \u201cregional innovation ecosystems,\u201d is just the latest example of the federal government\u2019s boundless optimism in its own ability to foster economic growth. The concept has been touted as having the potential to \u201cusher in an unprecedented era of innovation and progress,\u201d according to Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains. The idea, apparently, is to create what Bains calls a \u201cmade-in-Canada Silicon Valley.\u201d (Coincidentally, the $950 million that the government plans to spend building superclusters is roughly the same amount as what the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/auditor-general-phoenix-first-report-bigger-costs-1.4411987\">Auditor General reckons</a>\u00a0will be required to fix the Phoenix pay fiasco. But of course that has nothing to do with Ottawa\u2019s ability to think innovatively.) Perhaps someone should tell Mr. Bains that Silicon Valley somehow miraculously developed in the most unexciting of ways: a group of highly innovative and productive companies created products that consumers wanted. Private capital poured in. Markets responded. While it certainly helped to play a backroom role in the region&#8217;s rise, Washington was by no means the key development orchestrator.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/navdeep-bains-and-the-silicon-plant-people-from-saskatchewan/\">Paul Wells on the winners of the Liberals&#8217; supercluster initiative</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Productivity and innovation are mutual enablers, and addressing Canada\u2019s innovation crisis relies on first taking steps to ensure that our workforce is a global leader in productivity. If the federal government really wants to take a leading role in fostering a more innovative national economy, then it should abandon its Ottawa-centric attitude and turn its attention to policies that have been shown, time and again and across multiple geographies, to encourage productivity. Such policies might include providing more incentives for companies (both large and small) to invest in R&amp;D and capital infrastructure, encouraging post-secondary institutions to better tailor their programming to meet market demand in terms of subjects and skills, and making Canada a more attractive country for foreign or start-up companies to invest in by deregulating industries that have no business being as regulated or as protected as they are, such as telecommunications, airlines, and broadcasting.</p>\n<p>These recommendations were in fact cited by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in its <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/eco/growth/economic-survey-canada.htm\">2016 annual Economic Survey of Canada.</a> Naming a lack of productivity as a major impediment to future economic growth, the OECD called for Canada to pursue a platform of deregulation while also reducing interprovincial trade barriers and providing more incentives for small- and medium-sized companies to innovate and invest.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Unlike the Liberals&#8217; Advisory Council, none of the OECD&#8217;s recommendations involve an expanded role for government. Instead, the OECD&#8217;s report suggests that the best way to achieve greater productivity is for government to foster a more market-friendly environment. And being perhaps the world&#8217;s most comprehensive aggregator of economic data for the largest and most advanced economies on the planet\u2014and having tracked such data for the last five decades\u2014one might suggest that the OECD knows a thing or two about improving productivity and making an economy grow.</span></p>\n<p>Given that we\u2019re now two years into the Liberals\u2019 mandate, it seems unlikely that we\u2019re going to see a reversal of Ottawa\u2019s government-centric innovation drive. Unfortunately for Canadians, by the time this approach catches up to us, we\u2019ll have a lot more to worry about than the loss of 88,000 jobs in one month.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>MORE ABOUT\u00a0</b><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/innovation/\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>INNOVATION</b></span></a><b>:</b></span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/to-help-foundations-help-canada-our-fundamental-research-system-must-improve/\"><span class=\"s3\">To help foundations help Canada, our fundamental research system must improve</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/innovative-science-research-in-canada-is-dying-a-silent-death/\"><span class=\"s3\">Innovative science research in Canada is dying a silent death</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/q-a-navdeep-bains-on-selling-superclusters/\"><span class=\"s3\">Q&amp;A: Navdeep Bains on selling \u2018superclusters\u2019</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/how-a-u-k-economist-may-influence-canadas-innovation-agenda/\"><span class=\"s3\">How a U.K. economist may influence Canada\u2019s innovation agenda</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/liberals-nearing-decision-on-how-to-spend-innovation-fund/\"><span class=\"s3\">Liberals nearing decision on how to spend innovation fund</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/too-much-innovation-talk-can-be-a-bad-thing/\"><span class=\"s3\">Too much innovation talk can be a bad thing</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/business/big-law-is-having-its-uber-moment/\"><span class=\"s3\">Big law is having its Uber moment</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/glenn-gould-offers-lessons-for-apple-and-ottawa-on-innovation/\"><span class=\"s3\">Glenn Gould offers lessons for Apple, and Ottawa, on innovation</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/canada-is-lagging-on-innovation-and-the-liberals-arent-helping/\">Canada is lagging on innovation\u2014and the Liberals aren&#8217;t helping</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/canada-is-lagging-on-innovation-and-the-liberals-arent-helping/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>3</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Canadian real estate sales just fell the most since 2008.

The decline is one of the largest in Canadian history. Some agents claim this is temporary, but it\u2019s in line with the estimated declines we <a href=\"https://betterdwelling.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted earlier</a>.</p>\n<h3>Canadian real estate sales drop over 13 per cent</h3>\n<p>Canadian real estate sales made large declines. CREA reported 39,609 sales when seasonally adjusted for January. This a 13.8 per cent decline from December, and represents a 6.2 per cent decline compared to last year. Unadjusted, that number was just 24,931 sales. It\u2019s normal for a monthly decline in January, but the size should be of concern. CREA noted this is the first time since 2015, that sales have fallen below the 10 year, monthly average.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1100805\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_REAL_ESTATE_1.jpg\" alt=\"Canadian real estate sales (Seasonally adjusted)\" width=\"600\" height=\"478\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_REAL_ESTATE_1.jpg 1386w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_REAL_ESTATE_1-300x239.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_REAL_ESTATE_1-768x612.jpg 768w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_REAL_ESTATE_1-1024x816.jpg 1024w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_REAL_ESTATE_1-723x576.jpg 723w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_REAL_ESTATE_1-375x299.jpg 375w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_REAL_ESTATE_1-706x562.jpg 706w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<h3>Largest single month decline since October 2008</h3>\n<p>January\u2019s monthly decline is one of the largest in the history of Canadian real estate. The decline of 13.8 per cent works out to 6,367 less sales than the month before. A decline of this size hasn\u2019t been seen since October 2008. These sales declines will have both an impact on prices, as well as on the broader economy. As sales reduce, so do dollar volumes, which eventually lead to lower prices across the market. Real estate sales also generate \u201cspin off\u201d business activity, which also drops if this persists.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1100807\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_REAL_ESTATE_2.jpg\" alt=\"Monthly percentage change in Canadian real estate sales\" width=\"600\" height=\"478\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_REAL_ESTATE_2.jpg 1386w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_REAL_ESTATE_2-300x239.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_REAL_ESTATE_2-768x612.jpg 768w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_REAL_ESTATE_2-1024x816.jpg 1024w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_REAL_ESTATE_2-723x576.jpg 723w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_REAL_ESTATE_2-375x299.jpg 375w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_REAL_ESTATE_2-706x562.jpg 706w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<h3>The decline is in line with stress testing estimates</h3>\n<p>\u201cThe piling on of yet more mortgage rule changes that took effect starting New Year\u2019s Day has created homebuyer uncertainty and confusion,\u201d said CREA President Andrew Peck. The new B-20 Guidelines from OSFI did likely contribute to the sale decline. Only real estate boards are experiencing \u201cuncertainty and confusion\u201d however. We already went over why the decline would be this size.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"bc-video bc-video-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"player-loader\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n\t\t\t<iframe src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/video/iframe/13639244001/VJjIBwmqg/5389510190001\"\n\t\t\t\twidth=\"640\"\n\t\t\t\theight=\"360\"\n\t\t\t\tallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tmozallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; right: 0px; left: 0px;\" class=\"rdm-brightcove-videojs-iframe\"></iframe>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n<p>The Bank of Canada estimated a similar decline of buying activity as a result of the changes in rules.

The full impact of the new guidelines haven\u2019t been felt yet, either. Many lenders still honoured mortgages approved before B-20 Guidelines applied. This is even true for<a href=\"https://betterdwelling.com/cibc-kills-foreign-income-program-makes-buying-canadian-real-estate-harder/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u00a0foreign buyers, who only saw Guidelines apply to them as of February 1, 2018 at CIBC</a>. Other banks are expected to roll out similar rules for foreign income over the next few weeks, if they haven\u2019t already quietly issued the change.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1100809\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_REAL_ESTATE_3.jpg\" alt=\"Canadian low-ratio mortgages that would not have qualified\" width=\"600\" height=\"478\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_REAL_ESTATE_3.jpg 1386w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_REAL_ESTATE_3-300x239.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_REAL_ESTATE_3-768x612.jpg 768w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_REAL_ESTATE_3-1024x816.jpg 1024w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_REAL_ESTATE_3-723x576.jpg 723w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_REAL_ESTATE_3-375x299.jpg 375w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB16_REAL_ESTATE_3-706x562.jpg 706w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The decline of Canadian real estate sales was expected, as was the impact of B-20 Guidelines.

Canada\u2019s Parliamentary opposition parties can only dream of staffing on that scale, with the number of policy staffers countable using just one hand\u2014often with fingers left over. So, Canada\u2019s opposition parties must deal with a real lack of resources when trying to develop new policy initiatives.</p>\n<p>But, with an election just over a year away, the opposition parties are making do with the scant resources they have and starting to release their first policy initiatives. The Liberal government will get lots of attention with their upcoming budget, so let\u2019s instead shine some light on the policy direction the Conservatives and NDP are taking.</p>\n<p>In recent weeks, the Conservatives introduced two new policy initiatives in the form of Private Members\u2019 Bills on the <a href=\"https://www.parl.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=e&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=9630862\">taxation of parental leave benefits</a> and on <a href=\"https://www.parl.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=e&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=9632317\">facilitating workplace participation by Canadians with disabilities</a>. While <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/conservatives-propose-tax-credit-for-parents-on-leave/article37817587/\">the response</a> to the Conservative initiatives <a href=\"http://nationalpost.com/opinion/john-ivison-scheers-underwhelming-first-economic-policy-suffers-from-lack-of-boldness\">has been mixed</a>, two things stand out to me as a policy wonk. First, they got the policy \u2018nuts and bolts\u2019 right. \u00a0The numbers add up and the legislative approach is coherent. Second, there are clear signs the Conservatives are reaching out to external experts to seek help with policy, as evidenced by <a href=\"http://pierremp.ca/opportunity-act/\">the backgrounder released</a> by Conservative Shadow Finance Minister Pierre Poilievre.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/why-conservatives-and-the-ndp-are-fighting-over-the-working-class/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Why Conservatives and the NDP are fighting over the &#8216;working class&#8217;</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s true these policy offerings have been \u2018small ball\u2019 so far. But, if the Conservatives have now learned how to build coherent policy with the resources available to them as an opposition party, I think it bodes well for the platform the Conservatives will offer Canadians in 2019.</p>\n<p>What about the NDP? In a recent <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/macleans-live-with-jagmeet-singh-six-key-economic-takeaways/\">long-form interview with Maclean\u2019s Paul Wells</a>, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh laid out an ambitious vision for economic policy under a future NDP government. The NDP envisions a social safety net extended to cover drugs, dental, and eyecare. Moreover, with a rejigging of seniors benefits and income support for Canadians with disabilities, Jagmeet Singh is putting together a policy package that strikes me as exactly what a social democratic party ought to be offering. No \u2018small ball\u2019 for the orange party. Instead, they\u2019re putting together a big and bold expansion of social insurance that would have a material impact on the lives of struggling Canadians.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"bc-video bc-video-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"player-loader\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n\t\t\t<iframe src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/video/iframe/13639244001/VJjIBwmqg/5728211488001\"\n\t\t\t\twidth=\"640\"\n\t\t\t\theight=\"360\"\n\t\t\t\tallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tmozallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; right: 0px; left: 0px;\" class=\"rdm-brightcove-videojs-iframe\"></iframe>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n<p>So far so good\u2014Conservatives finding their policy sea-legs and the NDP focusing on big-picture social democratic projects. But what challenges do the parties face?</p>\n<p>For the Conservatives, the biggest challenge is finding fiscal balance for their platform.\u00a0 It seems likely the Trudeau government will head into 2019 with a smallish deficit in the range of $10 to $15 billion. This kind of deficit presents a real problem for Andrew Scheer. It\u2019s going to be really hard to offer both substantial tax cuts and also balance the budget without resorting to fiscal trickery.</p>\n<p>Of course, both tax cuts and budget balance are possible if Scheer takes a big axe to government spending.\u00a0 The prospect of big spending cuts may please small-government conservatives, but <a href=\"http://abacusdata.ca/get-the-next-10-reflections-and-data-on-how-the-conservatives-can-grow/\">recent Abacus polling</a> suggests that most \u2018gettable\u2019 voters aren\u2019t interested in pure austerity. Knowing this, Mr. Scheer is left hoping that the Liberals do the budget-balancing hard work before 2019, leaving the Conservatives plenty of easy room to cut taxes. I\u2019m not sure that will happen.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/conservatives-might-be-cheering-hardest-for-jagmeet-singh/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Conservatives might be cheering hardest for Jagmeet Singh</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The NDP has different problems. While their spending plans may align with the dreams of social democrats around the country, the NDP has presented very few good ideas on how to pay for their big plans. Where\u2019s the revenue coming from?</p>\n<p>Mr. Singh has mentioned going after off-shore tax avoidance. The problem with targeting off-shore tax avoidance is that it happens off-shore, out of the legislative reach of Canada\u2019s Parliament. Mr. Singh may really prefer that Panama or the Cayman Islands change their tax policy, but I don\u2019t see how he makes that happen with decrees issued from Ottawa. The Liberal government has already invested <a href=\"https://www.budget.gc.ca/2017/docs/plan/chap-04-en.html#Toc477707491\">over $500 million of new money</a> on fighting tax avoidance, and is fully participating in <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/tax/aggressive/\">international efforts</a> to scale back trans-national tax avoidance. Is the NDP\u2019s platform to be built upon the bet that the Liberals have left some easy billions lying around just waiting to be scooped?</p>\n<p>The other idea floated by Mr. Singh is to change the taxation of stock options for executives. I think this is a good idea in principle since it makes sense to tax all compensation in the same way, whether it be wages, salaries, or stock options. However, if stock options are put on par with wages and salaries then firms will get a tax deduction when stock options are issued just like they do with wages and salaries. (Lindsay Tedds explains <a href=\"https://deadfortaxreasons.wordpress.com/2015/03/30/repealing-the-employee-stock-option-deduction-and-unanswered-questions/\">all the details here</a>.) This firm-side deduction would wipe out most of the extra tax revenue, leaving the NDP billions short of what they would need to fund their ambitious plans.</p>\n<p>Overall, I think both major opposition parties are off to a good start with their policy development for the next federal election\u2014but there is work still to do. Taken together, the Conservatives look to be building a credible plan that lacks ambition, while the NDP\u2019s plan is ambitious but lacks credibility.\u00a0 But, there is still lots of time for the opposition parties to mount an effective 2019 platform, which will mean all Canadians can benefit from credible and diverse choices at the ballot box.</p>\n<h3>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/\">POLITICS</a>:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ontario-progressive-conservative-leadership-debate-live-video/\">Ontario PC leadership debate: Watch it here</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/politicians-need-to-stop-suing-each-other-its-bad-for-democracy/\">Politicians need to stop suing each other.

(THE CANADIAN PRESS/Fred Chartrand)</p></div>\n<p>&#8220;What is a supercluster?&#8221; Navdeep Bains asked, basically, himself.</p>\n<p>We were in a conference room at the Museum of Science and Technology, on a warehouse strip in eastern Ottawa near the highway. The museum is freshly renovated, thanks to money from, if we&#8217;re being honest, Stephen Harper&#8217;s Conservative government, which decided not to relocate the museum from its dispiriting precinct but did set aside some tens of millions to make it spiffy. Which it really is. Spiffy.</p>\n<p>I caught only a glimpse of the museum&#8217;s exhibits on my way to Bains&#8217;s announcement. The permanent exhibition begins with some wooden sleighs from olden times and ends, I feel certain, with a Canadarm. Everything in Ottawa ends with a Canadarm. It is as though Champlain came to shore in 1603 and said, &#8220;Here, with the help of God, we can make things that will one day lift other things in space.&#8221; How his crewmen must have stared at him then.</p>\n<p>But I digress. Navdeep Bains is the minister of ISED, which as everyone in Ottawa knows, stands for Innovation, Science, and something beginning with E. Here I am reporting to you the content of about 60 conversations everyone has had in Ottawa since the bright and personable MP for Mississauga\u2014Malton was rewarded in 2015 for his prowess as a political organizer (the local Liberal nominees, all Bains prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, rolled over the Conservatives and the third-place New Democrats, across the region, like a fleet of Zambonis).</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have a meeting at ISED,&#8221; the conversation begins.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s ISED?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Nav Bains&#8217;s shop. It used to be Industry. You know. Innovation, Science and&#8230;.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Awkward pause.</p>\n<p>But I digress.</p>\n<p>Bains was here to unveil the names of the five winners of funding under the feds&#8217; $950 million supercluster initiative, which was announced in the 2016 budget and is designed to make five superclusters. Since then, the country has been divided into (a) people who haven&#8217;t heard anything about this (b) people who have heard, and are full of snarky theories about what a supercluster is and what someone has to do to win $(950 million/ 5); (c) people who have been frantically organizing to win their $(950 million/ 5).</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/want-better-science-listen-to-scientists/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Want better science? Listen to scientists.</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>On Thursday at the Museum of Science and Technology on the warehouse row near the highway, it became clear, in case there had ever been any doubt, that group (c) comprises a hefty plurality of all Canadians.</p>\n<p>But I digress. &#8220;A supercluster,&#8221; Bains said, answering his own question, &#8220;is a made-in-Canada Silicon Valley that will create tens of thousands of jobs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The minister, in white shirt with rolled-up sleeves and necktie, striding the stage in a passable impression of his boss the Prime Minister, held a microphone and jabbed his free hand forward with each of the last words of his sentence. &#8220;Tens \u2014 of thousands \u2014 of jobs.&#8221; The audience, made up largely of consultants and PR people associated with one or another of the winning bids, clapped heartily, because if nothing else, the supercluster initiative has already been a big part of their own jobs.</p>\n<p>Then Bains announced the winners of the initiative: The <a href=\"http://oceansupercluster.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ocean</a> Supercluster from Atlantic Canada; the <a href=\"https://aisupplychain.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SCALE.AI</a> Supercluster from Quebec; the <a href=\"http://ngmc.qreserve.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Next Generation Manufacturing</a> Supercluster from Ontario; the <a href=\"https://www.proteinindustriescanada.ca/goals.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Protein Industries</a> Supercluster from the Prairies; and the <a href=\"https://bcsupercluster.azurewebsites.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Digital Technology</a> Supercluster from British Columbia.</p>\n<p>Readers are referred to each organization&#8217;s website for information on what they will do. The amount of information you will get from each website varies spectacularly.</p>\n<p>The next-gen manufacturing group from Ontario lists 27 people leading it, although it&#8217;s not clear how many will be involved on anything approaching a full-time basis (one is Meric Gertler, the president of the University of Toronto; another is my onetime colleague Giles Gherson, an Ontario deputy minister, listed as an &#8220;observer&#8221;).</p>\n<p>The AI supply-chain group from, essentially, Montreal (wait! I guess I&#8217;m just guessing about that) is comically gnomic. I could find no name of any actual person or company anywhere on the website. Only a series of Zen riddles. &#8220;Over 120 industrial and enabling institutions, from very large firms to start-ups, have joined forces in this journey,&#8221; the website says helpfully, &#8220;and we have strong momentum.&#8221;</p>\n<p>My early favourite is the protein supercluster from Saskatchewan. Partly because I can already hear you snickering. Partly because the Saskatchewan protein people were much in evidence at Bains&#8217;s announcement. And partly because there is actual information on their website. I&#8217;m in a mood to quote them at some length:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u00a0<em>PIC will move Canada to second place in global agricultural exports and fifth in agri-food exports, equivalent to an additional US$30 billion in exports in today\u2019s distribution of global export shares, and representing nearly 2% of current national GDP. Plant based protein is a $13 billion market opportunity.</em></p>\n<p><em>Outcomes from this cluster will be a new range of plant-derived foods, ingredients and feedstuffs of superior quality, commanding market premiums. As such, the initial focus will be on value-added canola and pulse crop derived products developed by the value chain, including germplasm innovation, crop management technologies, through to advanced processing technologies yielding novel products and further enhancing value through quality, traceability and brand identity.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>The protein people&#8217;s\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.proteinindustriescanada.ca/supporters.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">list of\u00a0</a><a href=\"https://www.proteinindustriescanada.ca/supporters.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">supporters</a> \u00a0has more than 150 names, including the &#8220;City of Lethbridge&#8221;\u2014I have family there; do they know they&#8217;re in on this adventure in germplasm innovation?; &#8220;Balsillie, Jim&#8221;; and something called &#8220;Naturally Splendid Enterprises Canada Ltd.&#8221;, which I could look up but I fear it would spoil the mystery.</p>\n<p>As a few of us policy wonks marvelled at all of this on Twitter, it was popular this morning to note that there was precisely one winning initiative for every major region of the country, except I guess for the territories and, more conspicuously, Alberta, which had two projects among the shortlisted finalists but none among the winners. It was hard not to correlate this outcome with the Trudeau Liberals&#8217; recent shaky performance in Alberta polls. Bains offered no description of the process that led from 50 applicants to nine finalists to five winners, except to assure reporters it was &#8220;rigorous.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But he also said there was an informal process of self-selection and recomposition among applicants as the process went along. When Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced this supercluster business nearly two years ago, businesses and universities and incubators and industry associations started scrambling to constitute themselves as broad sectoral research initiatives. Some of their efforts were more impressive than others, and as the supercluster sector became self-aware and competitive, some would-be applicants threw in their towels early and joined with others.</p>\n<p>So now we have these five. Each will get between $150 million and $250 million to spend over five years. The ISED official who briefed me wouldn&#8217;t say which winners were at the high end and which at the low end of that range; to some extent it depends on their ability to attract matching money from local business or, I suppose, from Balsillie, Jim.</p>\n<p>The obvious questions that arise are to some extent contradictory. On one hand, a lot of observers are wondering whether this whole business is a perfect waste of money. On the other, it&#8217;s possible to wonder whether the federal investment is anywhere close to big enough. See? Contradictory.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take them in order. I was told, as the crowd dispersed after Bains&#8217;s announcement, that the protein people from Saskatchewan hope to take parts of plants that are currently discarded during processing and turn them into profitable new products. They have also noticed that more and more Canadians, often especially in younger demographics, are preferring substitutes like coconut milk and almond milk to traditional dairy and eggs. And they hope to get in on that. Now that they are officially a supercluster, the protein people from Saskatchewan want to get into those growth markets big time. But surely somebody on the open prairie was already thinking of heading in that direction? So it&#8217;ll never be clear which of the prairie protein products of the future was <em>caused</em> by superclustering and which would have happened anyway. Although one presumes one knows what the Liberals will claim, lo unto the end of days, when campaigning in Saskatchewan.</p>\n<p>The opposite worry is that the money Bains announced Thursday will in the end come to resemble a drop in the bucket. At the high end, $250 million over five years, the richest superclusters will get about $50 million a year. By coincidence, <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/quebec-urged-to-quintuple-ai-investment-or-risk-losing-edge-in-machine-learning/article37984029/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a new report released Thursday</a> called on the Quebec government to quintuple its own artificial-intelligence investment to $50 million a year (but for twice as long) or the recent AI bubble in Montreal might burst.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s only about keeping Canadian activity at about the scale it was yesterday. Bains began popularizing his pitch by claiming that each of his superclusters will be a &#8220;made-in-Canada Silicon Valley.&#8221; Would that it were so simple. If the feds&#8217; goal here is to step in for anemic Canadian venture-capital performance, they have barely begun to step in: <em>quarterly</em> VC investment in the real, made-in-Silicon-Valley Silicon Valley has <a href=\"http://svcip.com/halftime-report-investment-in-silicon-valley-has-rebounded-from-2015s-low/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lately hovered </a>around $US5 billion. That&#8217;s about <em>four hundred times</em> the Canadian supercluster burn rate.</p>\n<p>A visiting tech executive from Waterloo asked me the other day what I make of this whole project, and I had to say that it&#8217;s probably a good thing in a lot of ways. If good people from varied but compatible disciplines and activities have been having substantially more meetings about what they have in common and how they can face the future in smart and competitive ways, there&#8217;s a limit to my appetite for disdain. If thousands of people are suddenly in one another&#8217;s contact apps as they plan for a more ambitious next few years, there&#8217;s actually no telling how much good can come from it all, but it&#8217;s certainly more than zero and maybe vast.</p>\n<p>If pulling Silicon Valley out of a hat were easy, it&#8217;d have been done by now. Lord knows every region-state in the world is trying to do it. But the protein people from Saskatchewan were in a fine mood on Thursday, and you didn&#8217;t have to be Balsillie, Jim to feel pleased for them too.</p>\n<h3>MORE BY\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/author/inklesswells/\">PAUL WELLS</a>:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/how-opioid-vending-machines-could-fix-vancouvers-drug-crisis/\">How opioid vending machines could fix Vancouver\u2019s drug crisis</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/trudeau-and-resource-projects-the-urge-to-get-it-done/\">Trudeau and resource projects: the urge to get it done</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-on-electoral-reform-maybe-consistency-isnt-the-word/\">Justin Trudeau on electoral reform: Maybe consistency isn\u2019t the word</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/patrick-brown-and-priorities/\">Patrick Brown and priorities: Why the PC Party leader couldn\u2019t last</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/on-north-korea-its-basically-bad-cop-bad-cop/\">On North Korea, it\u2019s basically bad-cop, bad-cop</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/dispatches-from-the-ottawa-biography-wars/\">Dispatches from the Ottawa biography wars</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-battle-of-bill-morneau/\">The Battle of Bill Morneau</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/navdeep-bains-and-the-silicon-plant-people-from-saskatchewan/\">Navdeep Bains and the Silicon Plant People from Saskatchewan</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/navdeep-bains-and-the-silicon-plant-people-from-saskatchewan/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>2</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Marie Henein, former Ghomeshi laywer, says #MeToo is a &#8216;necessary social awakening&#8217;</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/society/marie-henein-former-ghomeshi-laywer-says-metoo-is-a-necessary-social-awakening/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/society/marie-henein-former-ghomeshi-laywer-says-metoo-is-a-necessary-social-awakening/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 18:37:54 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Chatelaine]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Society]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[#MeToo]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Jian Ghomeshi]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Law]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Marie Henein]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[sexual harassment]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1100607</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>In an address at the University of Toronto, the polarizing criminal defence lawyer gave her thoughts on the pressures placed on working women</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/marie-henein-former-ghomeshi-laywer-says-metoo-is-a-necessary-social-awakening/\">Marie Henein, former Ghomeshi laywer, says #MeToo is a &#8216;necessary social awakening&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_497220\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<div id=\"attachment_497220\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-497220 size-full\" src=\"http://www.chatelaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/marie-henein-metoo-speech2.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" srcset=\"http://www.chatelaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/marie-henein-metoo-speech2.jpeg 822w, http://www.chatelaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/marie-henein-metoo-speech2-424x495.jpeg 424w, http://www.chatelaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/marie-henein-metoo-speech2-658x768.jpeg 658w, http://www.chatelaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/marie-henein-metoo-speech2-768x897.jpeg 768w, http://www.chatelaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/marie-henein-metoo-speech2-481x562.jpeg 481w\" alt=\"Marie Henein, shown here at College Park, gave a speech on #MeToo\" width=\"822\" height=\"960\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Marie Henein, shown here at College Park, gave a public talk on Feb. 14, 2018. (Chris So/Toronto Star via Getty Images)</p></div>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chatelaine.com/tag/marie-henein/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Marie Henein</a>\u00a0is one of the most polarizing women in Canada\u00a0\u2014 revered by many as one of Canada\u2019s top criminal defence lawyers and reviled by others for successfully defending\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.chatelaine.com/tag/jian-ghomeshi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jian Ghomeshi\u00a0</a>on four counts of sexual assault, expertly dismantling the credibility of each witness who took the stand.</p>\n<p>While her profile rose astronomically during that time, Henein has flown largely under the radar since then, which made her address at the University of Toronto\u2019s Hart House Debate club Wednesday night all the more intriguing. Before a packed auditorium, Henein spoke frankly about the #MeToo movement (a subject she said\u00a0she\u2019d \u201cbeen avoiding for a long time\u201d) and gave her thoughts on the unfair pressures and expectations placed on working women. Here are the highlights\u00a0of her talk.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/marie-henein-defends-herself/\"><strong>READ:\u00a0Marie Henein defends herself</strong></a></p></blockquote>\n<h3>On the value of the #MeToo movement</h3>\n<p>Henein quipped that she imagined many people would expect her to be against a social movement that empowers women to share their experiences of sexual harassment and assault. Not so. \u201cThe #MeToo movement, in my view, is a necessary social awakening,\u201d she said, bringing Black Lives Matter into the conversation, too. \u201cThese movements are a necessary barometer \u2014 think of it as a social gut-check.\u201d Their crucial role, she said, is \u201cto\u00a0shake us out of complacency,\u201d about how we as a society treat women and racial minorities.</p>\n<h3>On the dangers and drawbacks of our approach to #MeToo</h3>\n<p>What worries Henein about the movement\u00a0is what she sees as a \u201cmob mentality\u201d that has\u00a0crowded out the opportunity for critical thought. Proper arguments cannot happen over Twitter, according to Henein,<strong>\u00a0</strong>and the rush to judgment and condemnation that happens there doesn\u2019t serve the greater cause. For example,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.flare.com/news/margaret-atwood-feminism/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">piling on\u00a0</a>a feminist like\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.chatelaine.com/tag/margaret-atwood/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Margaret Atwood</a>, she said, is unproductive and stifling. \u201c[Piling on is]\u00a0willingly getting into the mud pit and wrestling while everyone else gets off on it,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t do it.\u201d</p>\n<h3>On whether the justice system serves women well</h3>\n<p>Henein is a staunch of advocate of the\u00a0justice system as it stands,\u00a0and fears the<strong>\u00a0</strong>aforementioned \u201cmob mentality\u201d might erode an\u00a0infrastructure designed to protect Canada\u2019s freedoms and democracy. The criminal courts are \u201cnot a microcosm of society,\u201d she said \u2014\u00a0their\u00a0purpose is<strong>\u00a0</strong>to determine innocence or guilt. But, she said, for sexual assault survivors or any complainant within the system, \u201cthere is a failure to provide information, a failure to explain what\u2019s happening and a failure to manage expectations because there are limits in terms of what can be done\u2026\u00a0What we do know is often, for many people, the criminal justice system doesn\u2019t give you the feeling you want when you come out the other side.\u201d Restorative justice may be a better avenue in some cases, but Henein also thinks there is more work to be done to find other creative solutions.</p>\n<h3>On boosting the visibility of women</h3>\n<p>This is one of Henein\u2019s main\u00a0messages when it comes to turning the tide on how women are treated at work and in society at large: \u201cWe have to do more so society can see us as leaders.\u201d She points to how Hillary Clinton was mistreated in the United States presidential campaign (Henein is\u00a0still \u201ctraumatized\u201d\u00a0by<strong>\u00a0</strong>her loss), and calls the<strong>\u00a0</strong>fundamental degradation of women the \u201croots\u201d of the #MeToo movement. This can be turned around, in part, by increasing the visibility of women in influential roles and\u00a0promoting women to roles they deserve. \u201cFeminist prime ministers are fine, but female leaders are better,\u201d she said.</p>\n<h3>On work-life balance and keeping women in the workforce</h3>\n<p>Henein said she refuses to do talks on work-life balance unless they\u2019re\u00a0in\u00a0front of\u00a0an all-male audience, \u201cbecause that\u2019s actually who needs to hear it.\u201d On what can be done to\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.chatelaine.com/news/women-criminal-defence-lawyers-are-dropping-out-in-droves/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keep women in criminal defence law</a>, she said \u201cNo one ever leaves a job they\u2019re completely fulfilled in.\u201d They leave because of \u201cexternal pressures,\u201d and messages that they need to do it all. \u201cYou\u2019re a shitty mom, and you\u2019re a shitty partner and you\u2019re a lousy lawyer if you can\u2019t manage to do absolutely everything. Those are the\u00a0<em>Lean In</em>\u00a0books \u2026 they don\u2019t tell you there\u2019s 10 nannies standing off to the side.\u201d She said she\u2019d like \u201cwomen to have the freedom to pursue their careers as vigorously as men do and to not be saddled with this enormous sense of guilt that if you aren\u2019t home at 4:30 feeding your kids, you are a bad human being.\u201d</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"bc-video bc-video-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"player-loader\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n\t\t\t<iframe src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/video/iframe/13639244001/default/5670245219001\"\n\t\t\t\twidth=\"640\"\n\t\t\t\theight=\"360\"\n\t\t\t\tallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tmozallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; right: 0px; left: 0px;\" class=\"rdm-brightcove-videojs-iframe\"></iframe>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/marie-henein-former-ghomeshi-laywer-says-metoo-is-a-necessary-social-awakening/\">Marie Henein, former Ghomeshi laywer, says #MeToo is a &#8216;necessary social awakening&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/society/marie-henein-former-ghomeshi-laywer-says-metoo-is-a-necessary-social-awakening/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Calgary hoped to land 50,000 Amazon jobs.

It was a rare move for a company that has been in hyper-expansion mode in recent years\u2014and, with its plans for a second massive headquarters at a yet-to-be determined location, is expected to add another 50,000 jobs.</p>\n<p>But even now, despite these layoffs, Amazon has a massive number of job openings listed on its website: nearly 13,000 in total.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a map of the nearly 450 global cities where Amazon currently has job openings. However the positions are far from evenly distributed. As the legend shows, most locations (429 of them, represented by the yellow dots) have fewer than 100 openings. In fact, 77 per cent of those cities have 10 or fewer postings. Fully one-third of current job openings are in Seattle.<img class=\"wp-image-1100599 alignleft\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Amazon-map-legend.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Amazon-map-legend.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Amazon-map-legend-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Amazon-map-legend-55x55.jpg 55w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Amazon-map-legend-250x250.jpg 250w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Amazon-map-legend-32x32.jpg 32w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Amazon-map-legend-64x64.jpg 64w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Amazon-map-legend-96x96.jpg 96w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Amazon-map-legend-128x128.jpg 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://fusiontables.google.com/embedviz?q=select+col0+from+1wbK0bdJotihMGXbhl1hvX0ZiaQufKR8Rck7hAUuM&amp;viz=MAP&amp;h=false&amp;lat=14.327921361267347&amp;lng=18.375313113281322&amp;t=1&amp;z=2&amp;l=col0&amp;y=2&amp;tmplt=2&amp;hml=ONE_COL_LAT_LNG\" width=\"100%\" height=\"462\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>How about Canada?

At stake is an estimated US$5-billion in investment and those 50,000 potential new jobs.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"bc-video bc-video-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"player-loader\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n\t\t\t<iframe src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/video/iframe/13639244001/VJjIBwmqg/5715298633001\"\n\t\t\t\twidth=\"640\"\n\t\t\t\theight=\"360\"\n\t\t\t\tallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tmozallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; right: 0px; left: 0px;\" class=\"rdm-brightcove-videojs-iframe\"></iframe>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n<p>Several other Canadian cities had originally hoped to land HQ2, with Calgary once seen as a solid contender. And while there were other benefits for Calgary from participating in the HQ2 beauty pageant, the consolation prize in jobs can only be disappointing. Of all the places where Amazon is presently expanding its workforce, only two jobs are open in all of Alberta. No city is even specified, so those two jobs could still go to Edmonton or elsewhere.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/for-longshot-cities-bidding-on-amazon-hq-was-never-really-about-amazon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">For longshot cities, bidding on Amazon HQ was never really about Amazon</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>These numbers are a reminder of what a retail goliath Amazon has become.</p>\n<p>They also put into perspective the upheaval in that sector.

The hurt caused by that small change would be felt most deeply halfway around the world, in the fields and silos of Saskatchewan.</p>\n<p>The new row established a 50 per cent tariff on the import into India of yellow peas, commonly used as a cheap substitute in gram flour, or at it\u2019s known locally, besan, a staple ingredient in South Asian cuisines. Many of the fields in which they grow can be found at the southern end of Canada\u2019s prairie provinces. During the 2016\u20132017 cycle, Canada exported 2.02 million tonnes of yellow peas to India, the world\u2019s largest market for such crops.</p>\n<p>So when India imposed its duty with immediate effect, it had an impact on the value of the cargo of a lot of ships floating across the oceans filled to the brim with a lot of the Prairies\u2019 finest product. \u201cThere was about a hundred thousand tons of peas that were enroute to India at the time,\u201d says Brennan Turner, the son of a Saskatchewan farming family and CEO of <a href=\"https://farmlead.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FarmLead</a>, an Ottawa-headquartered crop marketplace platform.</p>\n<p>A duty had been expected, but not such a high one and certainly not so suddenly. A lot of that crop was eventually diverted to China and Pakistan, at discount prices. The tariff remains in place, despite the Canadian government expressing its disappointment. Its imposition and effects illustrate some important things about the Canada-India bilateral relationship: Everything about India is at a scale that makes Canada look like a rounding error, it does not always behave in predictable ways and there is not a whole lot we can do about it.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/innovation/murad-al-katib-agt-food-and-ingredients/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The surprisingly innovative company revolutionizing Canada\u2019s lentil trade</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau makes his first state visit to India this month. His challenge, depending on whom you ask, is to kickstart an idling bilateral relationship or keep an accelerating one on course. He will hope to grow a still-small trade relationship and have to assuage India\u2019s security concerns about its diaspora in Canada.</p>\n<p>And he must choose whether to address or ignore a series of low-level irritants between the two countries. All this in service of accessing an explosive-growth market and retaining the favour of one of Canada\u2019s largest immigrant communities.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Trudeau\u2019s state visit</strong> marks the fourth such drop-in by one or other country\u2019s prime minister in the last decade. That\u2019s a considerable pace, and a positive sign according to India\u2019s former representative in Ottawa. Prime ministerial trips send \u201ca very clear message to other ministers, the bureaucracy, and business that \u2018We want this relationship to go forward,\u2019\u201d says Shashishekhar Gavai, the high commissioner to Canada from 2008 to 2012.</p>\n<p>Gavai arrived in Ottawa just after Trudeau, and says the then-MP always struck him a strong supporter of bilateral ties. \u201cHe used to attend almost every Indian function, and he used to make it a point to dress in ethnic wear, to be very much part of the crowd,\u201d Gavai recalls. Trudeau and Modi, both charismatic leaders, will \u201cestablish a very good chemistry,\u201d he predicts.</p>\n<p>Economic ties are one declared focus of the trip, and Canada\u2019s prime minister is set to speak at events hosted by the <a href=\"https://www.canada-indiabusiness.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Canada-India Business Council</a> (C-IBC) in Mumbai and New Delhi in the latter half. \u201cWe have leading business organizations in India take an interest on this visit, in a way that I have not seen before,\u201d says Kasi Rao, CEO of C-IBC and a longtime consultant and advisor on the bilateral relationship.</p>\n<p>Canada and India did $8.3 billion in merchandise trade in 2017, per Statistics Canada data\u2014the equivalent of a work week across the U.S.-Canada border. That number fails to capture some Canadian exports, which flow through other countries before reaching India. The Canadian government has expanded its trade commissioner service in India in recent years, and the two sides have been negotiating a free trade agreement since 2010, and an investment protection treaty since 2004, though neither will be signed during this visit.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/its-high-time-canada-looked-beyond-the-u-s-for-trade-opportunities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">It\u2019s high time Canada looked beyond the U.S. for trade opportunities</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>But it is clear that \u201cthis bilateral relationship has underperformed,\u201d says Vivek Dehejia, an <a href=\"https://carleton.ca/economics/people/dehejia-vivek-h/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">associate professor of economics</a> at Carleton University and fellow at Mumbai-based think-tank the <a href=\"http://www.idfcinstitute.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IDFC Institute</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s simply not achieved its potential given the size of the diaspora.\u201d</p>\n<p>Growing the bilateral relationship is made more complicated by India\u2019s current global popularity. Modi rode to power on a wave of economic aspiration, and governments around the world are keen to participate in the market opportunities that promises. Dehejia says the country\u2019s diplomats are \u201cfocused on the big fish\u201d like the U.S., China and Russia, as well as regional rival Pakistan. Canada is a minnow by contrast.</p>\n<p>That makes growing the bilateral relationship harder, and it is not clear in any case that the two government&#8217;s interests are currently aligned. Dehejia recalls a more natural affinity between Modi and Harper. \u201cThey see themselves as outsiders who have sort of stormed the bastion,\u201d he says, noting that Harper was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Modi on his electoral victory in 2014. The Conservatives were more commercially-driven, whereas Trudeau\u2019s interest might lie closer to home. \u201cThe Liberal government is very mindful of its diaspora constituency,\u201d Dehejia says. \u201cThey were an important voting block that got these guys into power.\u201d He expects to see some \u201cminor deals\u201d struck to show that the meetings were productive.</p>\n<p>Trudeau has previously <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/i-have-more-sikhs-in-cabinet-than-modi-canadian-pm/article8348687.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">jokingly pointed out</a> that there are more Sikh members of his cabinet than Modi\u2019s. The political prowess of the diaspora is certainly not lost on those in India. The <em>Times of India</em> ran the news of Trudeau\u2019s 2015 electoral triumph under the headline \u201cLiberals sweep Canada polls riding on Punjabi shoulders.\u201d That may be something of an overstatement\u2014when the new government took office, 19 of the 184 Liberal MPs were of Indian origin, and 17 of those were from the Punjabi community, a sizeable but hardly overwhelming number.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/harjit-sajjan-the-secret-weapons-of-trudeaus-commando-in-chief/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Harjit Sajjan: Canada\u2019s \u2018bad-ass\u2019 defence minister</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>If the visit is aimed at least partly an exercise in optics for the diaspora, then the prime minister\u2019s itinerary will provide plenty of photo ops. In addition to Mumbai and New Delhi, Trudeau will visit Agra, where the Taj Mahal is; Amritsar, the location of the Golden Temple; and Ahmedabad, in Modi\u2019s home state of Gujarat, which also has a significant diaspora in Canada.</p>\n<p>Dr. Anita Singh, who studies the bilateral relationship, says governments and parties often do not understand the interests and views of Canadians of Indian origin. \u201cThere\u2019s a big part of the [Indian] diaspora [in Canada] that\u2019s also not interested in pursuing better relations,\u201d she says. She notes that some members of the Sikh community continue to push for redress for the 1984 anti-Sikh violence that killed thousands in New Delhi. (While her last name is common in the Sikh community, Singh herself is not Sikh). Muslim Indians, meanwhile, have been subjected to increasing communal violence under BJP rule, and the Tamil community, both of Sri Lankan and Indian origin, also has a complicated relationship with India.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>RELATED:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/the-disappointment-of-narendra-modi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The disappointment of Narendra Modi</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>During his three-day 2015 visit to Canada, Modi made a speech before a crowd of thousands, mainly Canadians of Indian origin, at Toronto\u2019s Ricoh Coliseum.

Modi\u2019s public comments during the trip were often made in Hindi.</p>\n<p>Singh says that Modi is understood to have also taken personal issue with having been \u201cpersona non grata in Canada for a really long time.\u201d Before becoming prime minister, he had been denied a Canadian visa\u2014as he was by the U.S.\u2014over his alleged role in the 2002 Gujarat riots that killed at least 1,000 people, mostly Muslims.</p>\n<hr />\n<div id=\"attachment_1100421\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1100421\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB15_HEMMADI_POST02.jpg\" alt=\"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses the crowd at an event in Toronto during his 2015 visit to Canada\" width=\"822\" height=\"462\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB15_HEMMADI_POST02.jpg 822w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB15_HEMMADI_POST02-300x168.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB15_HEMMADI_POST02-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB15_HEMMADI_POST02-600x336.jpg 600w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB15_HEMMADI_POST02-375x211.jpg 375w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB15_HEMMADI_POST02-111x63.jpg 111w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses the crowd at an event in Toronto during his 2015 visit to Canada.

But even as its ministers have flocked eastwards, Canada\u2019s political and diplomatic reputation has suffered on the Indian side. A series of low-level diplomatic, commercial and political incidents in Canada involving Indian citizens or interests have made headlines in the Indian press, but gone largely unnoticed here.</p>\n<p>A <em>Hindustan Times</em> (HT) <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trudeau-s-call-to-modi-aimed-at-getting-warmth-back-in-india-canada-ties/story-7BveTgEutcXoqpRwSB0q8I.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> on a call between the two prime ministers in June last year claimed that \u201cplenty of frost has formed in the relationship in recent months.\u201d The chill was caused in part by the passage in April 2017 of a private member\u2019s motion advanced by a Liberal MPP in the Ontario legislature that labelled the 1984 violence against Sikhs a \u201cgenocide.\u201d An HT <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ontario-passes-motion-describing-1984-anti-sikh-riots-as-genocide/story-1YPs2tiMkvtW2Tp7UDyydK.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> quoted an unnamed Indian official complaining that Trudeau and his team \u201ccan\u2019t manage their own party.\u201d</p>\n<p>The reaction is notable, even if it displays a misunderstanding of Canadian political structures. The Ontario and federal Liberals are different entities, while the BJP is far more integrated at the state and national level.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/behind-the-local-controversy-hanging-over-harjit-sajjans-india-trip/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Behind the local controversy hanging over Harjit Sajjan\u2019s India trip</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Perceived support among members of the Sikh community for the establishment of a separate Sikh state called Khalistan has been an issue in the bilateral relationship for decades.</p>\n<p>The Ontario <a href=\"http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/house-proceedings/house_detail.do?Date=2017-4-6&amp;Parl=41&amp;Sess=2&amp;locale=en#P1097_242820\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">motion</a> made no mention of Khalistan, but was linked to other concerns about a possible resurgence of the movement in Canada by the Indian press.</p>\n<p>Stewart Beck, CEO of the <a href=\"https://www.asiapacific.ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Asia-Pacific Foundation of Canada</a> and Canada\u2019s high commissioner to India from 2010 to 2014 says that during his time in India and likely still today, the issue is constantly brought up at the bilateral table by Indian officials. \u201cWhat they\u2019re looking for is some sort of comfort that the [Canadian] government understands that this goes on,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to see symbolic support for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>In 2011, Canada <a href=\"http://nationalpost.com/news/politics/ottawa-quietly-apologized-to-india-after-canadian-soldiers-appeared-with-posters-of-sikh-radicals-at-temple\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">apologized</a> to India after military personnel and MPs attended a parade in which some floats were adorned with posters of men some in the Sikh community consider to be martyrs, but others and the Indian government considers radicals. Beck and Gavai both say there has been an increased awareness of India\u2019s concern over the Khalistan issue on the Canadian side in the recent past.</p>\n<p>Last May, an Indian citizen was <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/canada-denies-entry-to-retired-crpf-officer-over-rights-abuse-torture-murder-by-the-force/story-qpOUm7WX05TG1vN57EOrqL.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">barred from entering</a> Canada. According to a letter issued to the individual, who claims he had a valid visa, at Vancouver airport, the denial was a result of his service as an officer in India\u2019s central police force, which the document said had \u201ccommitted widespread and systematic human rights abuses.\u201d The Indian press <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/canada-denies-entry-to-retired-crpf-officer-over-rights-abuse-torture-murder-by-the-force/story-qpOUm7WX05TG1vN57EOrqL.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">read that</a> reasoning as a \u201cstartling condemnation of India.\u201d The Canadian high commission in New Delhi insisted the document contained generic language, and did not reflect the government\u2019s position towards India.</p>\n<p>The events in Vancouver followed an earlier diplomatic incident. In 2010, several Indian officers <a href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/visa-refusal-india-outraged-says-canada-discriminating-419130\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> being denied visas on the grounds of their service in police and armed forces. Gavai said that while his government recognized that the decisions were made on the basis of Canadian law and were not specific to India, the information requirements to obtain immigration documents for former servicemen were seen as intrusive. \u201cThis is classified [and] sensitive information, and holding back visas on these grounds, it\u2019s an irritant for the relationship,\u201d he said, though he insists any bilateral disruption was minor and recalls the individual cases being resolved.</p>\n<p>Beck, who arrived in India shortly after the 2010 incident, says \u201cit took us a while to get out from underneath it.\u201d He recalls giving a talk at the Defence Services Staff College in Wellington in southern India, which often hosts and trains officers from other countries, and having to answer questions about Canadian visa policies for security personnel. \u201cThis was like two years later.\u201d</p>\n<p>At least one business operating in Canada has also caused some consternation in India recently. In January 2017, Indian foreign minister Sushma Swaraj, an active participant on Twitter, took exception to the sale on Amazon\u2019s Canadian site of door mats bearing the Indian flag. In a series of missives, she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SushmaSwaraj/status/819192573134680064\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">demanded</a> an \u201cunconditional apology,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SushmaSwaraj/status/819192941130326016\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">threatened</a> to cancel the visas of company employees and not issue any new ones, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sushmaswaraj/status/819177814037512193\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ordered</a> the Indian high commission in Ottawa to intervene. The offending furnishings <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amazon-takes-off-indian-flag-doormats-but-yet-to-apologise-to-sushma-swaraj/story-NvZOgkyO1m3hkKKOLsSscL.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">were withdrawn</a>. Months later, a BJP spokesperson <a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/fyi/story/amazon-canada-bjp-map-disputed-territories-975946-2017-05-08\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">objected</a> to the presence on the same site of an Indian flag wall sticker that excluded disputed areas of Kashmir.</p>\n<p>None of the former diplomats or India watchers, whether they are bullish on the overall bilateral relationship or not, consider these incidents and the considerable coverage they received in India, to be major impediments.</p>\n<p>Dehejia says these irritants are not themselves things that India\u2019s foreign ministry are \u201cespecially fussed about,\u201d but instead reflect a lull in relations overall. \u201cGiven that there\u2019s not much that\u2019s happening, that\u2019s what lands on your desk, and what the media also picks up on.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>The pulse tariffs</strong> similarly do not seem to have muted the positive noises coming out of the two governments. India has historically used a mix of tariffs and pest control rules to regulate its domestic pulse markets. In addition to the duties imposed at the end of last year, Canadian exporters have also had to contend with the resurfacing of a longstanding issue around the fumigation of shipments.</p>\n<p>Long-term, India\u2019s appetite for pulses will continue to grow, and that\u2019s good for the industry in Canada says Murad Al-Katib, CEO of Regina-based agricultural processing and trading firm AGT Foods &amp; Ingredients. \u201cAt the end of the day, people have to eat, and it\u2019s a protein business.\u201d</p>\n<p>Diplomatic and policy hurdles notwithstanding, it is clear that the floor under the bilateral relationship continues to rise. Outside the halls of government, ties between the two countries continue to grow. More and more Indian students are enrolling at Canadian colleges and universities, and those institutions are forming research partnerships with their Indian equivalents.</p>\n<p>Canadian institutional investors are \u201cperhaps next only to the Japanese,\u201d says Rao, despite the investor protection agreement remaining unfinished. \u201cIf the Canada-India of the 1950s was built on aid and development, [then] today [it\u2019s] being built on trade and investment, ideas and innovation,\u201d Rao says.</p>\n<p>That should give Trudeau and Modi plenty to celebrate on this visit, even if the Canadian prime minister may leave with the potential of India-Canada relations still mostly unrealized.</p>\n<h3>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/india/\">INDIA</a>:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/culture/why-arundhati-roy-returned-to-fiction-after-20-years/\">Ministry of Utmost Happiness author Arundhati Roy on returning to fiction</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/behind-the-local-controversy-hanging-over-harjit-sajjans-india-trip/\">Behind the local controversy hanging over Harjit Sajjan\u2019s India trip</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/the-anti-abortion-movements-cynical-embrace-of-gender-equality/\">Why the anti-abortion movement is embracing gender equality</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/can-bollywood-star-sunny-leone-help-india-get-over-its-prudish-past/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Can porn star Sunny Leone help India get over its prudish past?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/worldpolitics/india-may-hate-arvind-kejriwal-but-hes-doing-something-right/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">India may hate Arvind Kejriwal.

(Aaron McKenzie Fraser)</p></div>\n<p>When Jean-Paul Deveau returned home to Nova Scotia in 1981 on summer break from McGill University, he discovered he had no bedroom.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m about to go put my stuff in my room and my mother stops me and says, \u2018So, before you go upstairs\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009your father started a business and he\u2019s running it out of your bedroom,\u2019\u2009\u201d the president and CEO of Acadian Seaplants Limited remembers. \u201c\u2009\u2018So you\u2019re welcome to stay here but you have to find some other place to sleep.\u2019\u2009\u201d</p>\n<p>His bedroom was the incubation laboratory for Acadian Seaplants, which today is the largest independent marine plant processing company in North America, with six processing plants spread across Atlantic Canada, Ireland and Scotland. It makes seaweed-based food, agricultural and chemical products, ranging from dehydrated \u201csea vegetables\u201d for salad and pasta dishes to pet food to crop fertilizer to additives for brewing. Seaweed is plentiful around the Nova Scotia coastline, where the company is still headquartered. Deveau\u2019s father, the 86-year-old Louis E. Deveau, was perhaps destined for a career in seaweed. As a kid growing up on the shores of Baie Sainte-Marie, Louis noticed his own father put <em>go\u00e9mon de roche</em> (the Acadian term for the seaweed harvested from the rocky shoreline) on the family\u2019s vegetable garden. The practice yielded excellent results and spurred his realization that the plentiful plants were rich in nutrients.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/lists-and-rankings/best-managed-companies/introduction-2017/\">Secrets of Canada\u2019s Best Managed Companies</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>His fascination with the sea plant\u2019s potential resulted in Louis joining Marine Colloids, a subsidiary of the world\u2019s largest carrageenan gum manufacturer, in 1967. He later led seaweed-connected businesses in the Philippines and Mexico before moving to New Jersey as a vice-president of Marine Colloids\u2019 U.S. operations. He was soon appointed president of the company\u2019s Canadian wing, where he was also responsible for sourcing seaweed around the globe. \u201cHe also spearheaded the development of an entirely new industry\u2014seaweed farming in the Philippines and Indonesia, which today is a major industry in those countries,\u201d notes the Acadian Seaplants website with pride.</p>\n<p>In 1981, already a seaweed expert, he decided to become a seaweed entrepreneur. It was a risky\u2014and prescient\u2014move.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere was no market for most of the products we make now,\u201d Deveau says. \u201cThe market emerged afterwards.\u201d And, in many instances, it was created by Louis.</p>\n<p>The company that would become Acadian Seaplants was originally a small, seasonal seaweed harvesting operation, based in Nova Scotia and owned by the parent company of Louis\u2019s long-time employer. After Louis bought its Nova Scotian assets in 1981, the firm\u2019s former owners became its first\u2014and for several years <em>only</em>\u2014customer. It wasn\u2019t a bad way to start a business, but Louis quickly recognized the vulnerability and unsustainability of such a business plan.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Deveau was \ufb01nishing his M.B.A. at McGill. When he came home in 1985, he still had no bedroom. Instead, his father presented him with the kind of job every freshly minted M.B.A. dreams of: there was no pay and high risk. But it had big potential, for either success or failure.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe said, \u2018Do you want to see what we can build with this thing I\u2019m running out of your bedroom?\u2019\u2009\u201d Deveau laughs. \u201c\u2009\u2018We don\u2019t have enough money to pay you, but let\u2019s see what we can build.\u2019 And off we went, and we never looked back.\u201d</p>\n<p>The ability of both Deveaus to take calculated risks continues to define the multinational company\u2019s culture in its fourth decade of operations.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/lists-and-rankings/best-managed-companies/napoleon-grills/\">How Napoleon Grills uses insights from the shop floor to keep quality high</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWhat I really like about Acadian is they are not afraid,\u201d says Derrick Dempster, a partner at Deloitte who works with Acadian in the Best Managed Companies program. \u201cThey operate in a number of countries, they continue to expand strategically and they\u2019re open to taking risks in new environments. They take on those challenges and they create new markets for themselves as a consequence.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Deveaus agree. Louis, from Acadian\u2019s inception, applied a \u201clong-play\u201d business strategy, grounded in heavy investment in scientific research and developing new markets. Deveau believes the company\u2019s current success is driven by four deceptively simple factors. They are all about investment: in research and development, in international market development, in sustainability and in people. These commitments were seeded by Louis on day one, and have been consistently nurtured ever since by father, son and an ever-expanding pool of talent.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe find the best people in the world and either bring them to Canada to have them work for us in Nova Scotia\u2014we speak more than 10 languages in our facility here\u2014or we base them throughout the world to represent our company in all the countries in which we operate,\u201d says Deveau. The company now exports to more than 80 countries and has staff in 12 locations around the globe.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/lists-and-rankings/best-managed-companies/kids-and-company/\">How Kids &amp; Company modernized child care for the on-demand age</a></strong></p>\n<p>Acadian\u2019s talent strategy is guided by the same kind of long-term focus Louis brought to the seaweed business: nothing is about today. It\u2019s not even about tomorrow\u2014it\u2019s about the next three, five or 10 years. Acadian tries to envision the future, and then it actively creates it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI go to a lot of conferences and we are, of course, comparing ourselves to our competitors. And when we see that what we presented three years ago, other companies are doing now, we have to ask ourselves, immediately, what do we do next? What\u2019s the potential, the next opportunity, the new market no one else is thinking about?\u201d says Deveau.</p>\n<p>Indeed, how the company harvests its products is under constant evaluation and improvement. Hyper-competitive long-term thinking like that will continue to contribute to Acadian\u2019s success.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey will continue to change and create new products,\u201d says Dempster. \u201cThey really think of themselves as a learning organization, and they\u2019ve created infrastructure to support that. They\u2019re a Canadian business based in Nova Scotia, but they understand that their market is global.\u201d</p>\n<h3>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/best-managed-companies/\">CANADA\u2019S BEST MANAGED COMPANIES</a>:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/lists-and-rankings/best-managed-companies/napoleon-grills/\">How Napoleon Grills uses insights from the shop floor to keep quality high</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/lists-and-rankings/best-managed-companies/running-room/\">For the Running Room, the shift to digital retail is a marathon, not a sprint</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/lists-and-rankings/best-managed-companies/kids-and-company/\">How Kids &amp; Company modernized child care for the on-demand age</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/lists-and-rankings/best-managed-companies/g-adventures/\">How G Adventures made social good a key part of its management strategy</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/lists-and-rankings/best-managed-companies/steam-whistle-brewing/\">How singular focus made Steam Whistle Brewing one of Canada\u2019s top workplaces</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/lists-and-rankings/best-managed-companies/cowater-international/\">Cowater International: Canada\u2019s Best Managed Companies 2017</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/business/canadas-best-managed-companies-acadian-seaplants/\">How Acadian Seaplants became a global leader in seaweed</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/economy/business/canadas-best-managed-companies-acadian-seaplants/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Pompe disease is treatable\u2014when you know you have it</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/sponsored/pompe-disease-is-treatable-when-you-know-you-have-it/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/sponsored/pompe-disease-is-treatable-when-you-know-you-have-it/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:21:04 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[helen williams]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Sponsored]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1097477</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>With Pompe, as with so many rare diseases, a lack of awareness can be deadly.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/sponsored/pompe-disease-is-treatable-when-you-know-you-have-it/\">Pompe disease is treatable\u2014when you know you have it</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_1097519\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=4560426665&amp;iu=/7326/Tracking.Pixels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1097519\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Pompe_822x536.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"822\" height=\"536\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Pompe_822x536.jpg 822w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Pompe_822x536-300x196.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Pompe_822x536-768x501.jpg 768w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Pompe_822x536-375x245.jpg 375w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Julie Mason and Pierre Beauchamp photographed at their home in Montreal, QC. (Credit: Christine Kirzeder)</p></div>\n<p>Montreal native Julie Mason thought she was just out of shape. She assumed she had spent too long behind a desk and that was why, in her 50s, she was having difficulty climbing stairs. When she decided to join a gym and get back in shape, she had no idea what she was in for.</p>\n<p>The gym she joined had medical professionals on site to help new members achieve their goals, and from the first meeting Julie realized that her situation was more complex than she had thought. \u201cI saw the cardiologist at my gym and told him I was so out of shape that I couldn&#8217;t walk up stairs anymore,\u201d Julie says. \u201cHe asked how old I was, and when I told him I was 58, he said, &#8216;You need to go see a neurologist.&#8217;\u201d</p>\n<p>So began a year\u2019s long process of medical tests and uncertainty. \u201cThe more tests they did, the less enthusiastic I was about finding out what was going on,\u201d admits Julie. \u201cAnd even after all the tests, they still didn&#8217;t know what was happening in my body. They knew there was something wrong but didn&#8217;t know what it was. This went on for four years.\u201d</p>\n<p>In 2010, it was a PhD student with the Montreal Neurological Institute who was reviewing Julie&#8217;s file that asked her to come in to be tested for <a href=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=4560426659&amp;iu=/7326/Tracking.Pixels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pompe disease</a>, a rare genetic disorder that affects about one in forty thousand people. It&#8217;s so rare that many doctors have never seen a single case, and so it frequently goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as other conditions, such as muscular dystrophy, neuropathy or ALS. Julie\u2019s dry blood spot (DBS) test, an easily-accessible screen that can identify four lysosomal storage disorders, came back positive for Pompe. With a diagnosis in hand, Julie&#8217;s life was now changed.</p>\n<p><strong>The earlier treatment begins, the better</strong></p>\n<p>Hers is a distressingly common story and, because Pompe is a progressive disease, the length of time it can take to get an accurate diagnosis is especially concerning. \u201cThe longer it takes to begin proper treatment, the more permanent damage there is and the harder it is to reverse,\u201d says Pompe expert Dr. Mark Tarnopolsky. \u201cIn general, the earlier you start an intervention, the more likely the therapy is to be effective. And that&#8217;s why appropriate diagnosis is essential.\u201d</p>\n<p>The arc of Pompe disease begins with general weakness and an intolerance of exercise. If left untreated, it progresses to include respiratory problems that can eventually become lethal, with the prognosis worsening the earlier the patient experiences onset. This makes the issue of early screening particularly important. \u201cInfantile-onset Pompe is much more severe than adult-onset, even though it\u2019s still a fatal disease for adults,\u201d explains Brad Crittenden, the Executive Director of the Canadian Association of Pompe. \u201cIn other jurisdictions, they\u2019re screening all infants for Pompe disease. We don&#8217;t do that in Canada yet, even though it&#8217;s easy and can save lives.\u201d</p>\n<p>Prompt diagnosis, in both infantile- and adult-onset cases, is even more important now that there is finally effective treatment that can slow or even halt progression of the disease. \u201cBefore the treatment became available, patients had no hope at all,\u201d says Crittenden. \u201cThis was a fatal disease. We\u2019ve seen a huge change, from having no treatment and no hope at all to now having something that can basically save lives.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Greater awareness begets better outcomes</strong></p>\n<p>For Julie, the treatment, which she began in 2012, has indeed saved her life, but it remains frustrating to know that her outcome could have been better had she been diagnosed earlier. She\u2019s thankful that treatment has allowed her to preserve the function and mobility she still has, and especially thankful for the family support network that enables her to continue living her life with Pompe, but living with the limitations imposed by the disease is still difficult. \u201cI couldn&#8217;t have gotten to where I am right now without my husband,\u201d Julie says. \u201cHe was an airline pilot and was gone for four days out of seven for 35 years, so I used to do everything around the house. Now he does everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Awareness is truly the most critical component. When many doctors, and the vast majority of laypeople, have never heard of a disease, it can be far too easy for people to live with a condition for years or even decades without knowing that it\u2019s treatable. \u201cWe&#8217;re probably missing one or two people for every patient we diagnose,\u201d says Dr. Tarnopolsky. \u201cIf people are having difficulty climbing stairs or getting off the toilet seat in their 30s or 40s, that&#8217;s a strong indication that they should see a neurologist.

(Credit: Patrick Chondon)</p></div>\n<p>Imagine your organs failing one after another and having no idea why. Imagine periodic attacks of neuropathic pain with no apparent cause. Or having a stroke that doctors can\u2019t explain. This is the reality of life with undiagnosed Fabry disease.</p>\n<p>As with many rare diseases, most Canadians living undiagnosed with Fabry have never even heard of the disease. Unfortunately, the same is largely true for their doctors. \u201cThere&#8217;s not enough awareness about Fabry disease,\u201d says Julia Alton, the Executive Director of the Canadian Fabry Association and a Fabry patient herself. \u201cI met a gentleman a few weeks ago who is 70 years old and just learned he has Fabry. He\u2019s lived with it his whole life, going through a heart attack and a stroke without ever knowing why.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=4560433335&amp;iu=/7326/Tracking.Pixels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fabry disease</a> is a genetic disorder that affects both men and women, but the onset is usually earlier in males, starting in childhood, whereas women may not begin experiencing symptoms until their teens or twenties. Diagnosis is complicated not just by a lack of awareness of the disease, but by how disjointed the symptoms can appear from one another, leading Fabry patients to see multiple specialists for individual complaints without anyone realizing there\u2019s a single cause. \u201cThe classic symptoms are tingling and pain in the hands and feet, absence of sweating, and significant gastrointestinal symptoms that mimic irritable bowel syndrome,\u201d explains Julia&#8217;s specialist, Dr. Chantal Morel of the University Health Network. \u201cFabry mimicking more common conditions is a big part of the problem in diagnosis.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Reliable testing and treatment are available\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The good news is that <a href=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=4560433323&amp;iu=/7326/Tracking.Pixels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reliable testing</a> for the disease now exists, and effective treatments that can slow or halt the progression of the disease have been available since 2006. Since the advent of these therapies, prompt diagnosis is more important than ever, as the damage that has already been done can usually not be reversed. \u201cI lost my dad to Fabry disease when I was 18 years old,\u201d says Julia. \u201cI lost him because he didn&#8217;t get treatment early enough. He was only on treatment for the last two years of his life. He said that they were his best years in terms of quality of life, but it was just too late.\u201d</p>\n<p>At that point in Julia&#8217;s life, she had already begun to see <a href=\"https://www.fabrycanada.com/diagnosis-treatment/symptoms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the symptoms</a> of her own Fabry disease. Genetically, she had always known that she had the disease, but it was easy not to think about. Until, it wasn&#8217;t. \u201cI had my first symptom of Fabry at age 15,\u201d says Julia. \u201cI got the flu, and it was accompanied by the pain in the hands and feet that is a hallmark sign of Fabry. I remember sitting with a fever and saying to my parents, &#8216;I have pain in my hands and feet,&#8217; and they just looked at each other, because they knew what that meant.\u201d</p>\n<p>After losing her father, Julia knew that she had to take a hard look at her own future. \u201cThat&#8217;s when the fear set in, in terms of what my life was going to look like with this disease,\u201d she says. \u201cMy father was a real example to me in that he didn&#8217;t let the disease define who he was. So I set out to live my own life in a way where Fabry and fear didn&#8217;t take over my thoughts and my life. There was no association at that time, so a number of patients, including my mother, started one. It was a natural decision to devote my career to advocating for our community. I realized how much having a rare disease can affect your life and I wanted to be able to change that for people and help them live their best lives.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Education leads to empowerment</strong></p>\n<p>Today, for Julia, living with a rare disease is just another of the experiences and challenges that make her who she is, an idea exemplified by her <a href=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=4560433326&amp;iu=/7326/Tracking.Pixels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u201cBe Rare Be You\u201d</a> campaign, which has grown from a local Thunder Bay initiative into an international movement. \u201cYou don&#8217;t have to have a rare disease to be rare,\u201d says Alton. \u201cWe are all rare in our own way. We all have our own stories that are unique to us. So, the &#8216;Be Rare Be You&#8217; idea is about being who you are and owning your story. When you live with a rare disease, there are so many things you can&#8217;t control. Once you start focusing on the things you <em>can</em> control, that&#8217;s empowerment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Empowerment means having the knowledge and awareness to assist your health care providers in coming to a correct and prompt diagnosis. It means knowing that there is effective treatment available and exciting ongoing research promising new therapies to come. Empowerment means being rare, and it means being you.</p>\n<p><strong>If you or someone you know is experiencing a symptom that may be associated with Fabry, talk to your doctor.

(Credit: Max Rosenstein)</p></div>\n<p>Access to treatment and medication is a perennial rough spot in Canada&#8217;s generally-beloved health care system, and this issue has been put in the spotlight by recent decisions affecting patients across the spectrum. Doctors and patient groups are expressing concern that excessive focus on the price of treatments may be limiting access for Canadians and putting Canada&#8217;s future as a hub of medical innovation at risk.</p>\n<p><strong>The hemophilia battleground</strong></p>\n<p>Canadian Blood Services (CBS), the organization that manages the Canadian blood supply, is also responsible for ensuring access to critical blood factor treatments for conditions like hemophilia. A <a href=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=4560433188&amp;iu=/7326/Tracking.Pixels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent decision</a> has seen CBS discontinue access to several effective therapies in favour of a wholesale shift to cheaper options.</p>\n<p>The nature of this change raises serious concerns for members of the hemophilia community who have relied on the previous treatments, especially since because CBS first approved the change, it has come to light that the replacement treatments have not been approved for pediatric use by Health Canada. The result is that some younger patients will be able to continue on their existing treatments, while older patients will not. &#8220;For example, a family with two hemophiliac children\u2014say a ten-year-old and a nineteen-year-old\u2014could conceivably end up in the awkward situation of having the younger child continue on their current treatment while his or her older brother would have to be switched to an alternative,\u201d explains Pediatric Hematologist Dr. Jayson Stoffman of the Children\u2019s Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba. \u201cThe family would then have to deal with two different products in the fridge and two different mixing systems for home treatment, not to mention the added challenges if either child ever had to go to the ER for treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>The arrival of new treatments should be a good thing</strong></p>\n<p>While this is currently a point of contention amongst the hemophilia community, concerns about changing access to treatments are also being voiced regarding many other rare disease conditions. \u201cIn the past, this wasn&#8217;t so much of a problem for rare diseases, because often there was only one treatment available,\u201d says Durhane Wong-Rieger, the President and CEO of the Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders. \u201cBut it\u2019s only going to happen more often now that we\u2019re seeing more products become available for rare diseases. Having more products on the market isn\u2019t a problem, but forcing patients to switch to a different product simply because it&#8217;s cheaper isn\u2019t a good idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>This is exactly the situation that Albertan Karen McCullagh finds herself in as she fights to retain access to the treatment that\u2019s been working for her son, Andrew. Andrew has a rare genetic disorder called cystinosis which, if left untreated or improperly treated, can cause complete kidney failure. \u201cIf he\u2019s forced to change treatments and the new treatment turns out to be less effective, his life expectancy will be compromised,\u201d Karen says. \u201cHe\u2019s medically stable right now and is in fact thriving on his current course of treatment. Families who are faced with a rare disease diagnosis already have so much on their plate to contend with. Having your child\u2019s treatment plan disrupted or changed because of inflexible or outdated government policies only further exacerbates an already challenging situation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Further, it\u2019s possible that continued implementation of these policies will not only put more Canadians into Andrew&#8217;s situation, but will also result in a total lack of access to innovative treatments yet to come. &#8220;There\u2019s a real risk that, with too much pushback, pharmaceutical companies may simply withdraw from the Canadian market,\u201d says Dr. Stoffman. \u201cCanadian patients deserve to have access to novel therapies. There are a lot of innovative new therapies coming down the pipe and we want to make sure that we\u2019re able to get them.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Finding a balanced way forward</strong></p>\n<p>As experts express concern about the potential for a race to the bottom when treatments are prioritized by price, they also acknowledge that health care costs must be managed if we\u2019re going to provide sustainable care.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there\u2019s nothing tying us to an all-or-nothing approach, and we do have the tools to control costs while also maintaining access to the best treatments for each individual patient and situation. \u201cA lot of this could be solved if we made a commitment to patient-centred care and patient choice,\u201d says Wong-Rieger. \u201cWe could say that, at the end of the day, we\u2019re willing to have processes that allow us to have the most effective approach as long as we\u2019re committed to preserving the right of the patient to have an element of choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>If Canada is to remain a global beacon of sustainable health care and medical innovation, these are the conversations we need to be having today.</p>\n<p><strong>The Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders is dedicated to supporting the rare disorder community in Canada.

(Credit: Branches Photography)</p></div>\n<p>Learning that your child is sick is traumatic for any parent. But when the diagnosis shows that it\u2019s a rare and progressive disease, it can throw your life into a state of chaos.</p>\n<p>For Emma and Steve Rideout of Beaver Bank, NS, this nightmare became a reality last June when they learned that their fourteen-month-old son, Morgan, had <a href=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=4560433179&amp;iu=/7326/Tracking.Pixels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spinal muscular atrophy</a> (SMA), an uncommon and progressively-worsening neuromuscular disorder that is a leading genetic cause of death in infants.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was shortly after Morgan\u2019s first birthday, and we\u2019d been expecting him to be walking at that point, but he wasn\u2019t,\u201d Emma recalls. \u201cAs time went on, we noticed that he\u2019d stopped doing other things as well. So that raised some concerns.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe reached out to our family doctor, who then referred us to a neurologist and a physiotherapist. On June 7th, we met with our neurologist and she said, \u2018I believe your son has type 2 spinal muscular atrophy.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201cI think we had to have her say that about half a dozen times,\u201d says Emma.</p>\n<p><strong>Finding support\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cWe started composing an email to our closest friends and family, letting them know what was going on. And there was one response that really surprised me,\u201d says Emma. \u201cIt said, \u2018I\u2019ve got a friend whose nephew has type 1 SMA. Whenever you\u2019re ready, we can put you in touch.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>It may have been a small gesture, but to the Rideout family, it felt more like a lifeline.</p>\n<p>Soon after, the Rideouts connected with Cure SMA Canada, an organization that provides family support and funding for SMA research.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey sent us this package as a newly-diagnosed family, and I was thinking it was going to be brochures. But we opened it up and it was toys and games to play with. There was a beautiful blanket for Morgan to lie on and quilts that had been handmade by families across the country,\u201d says Emma. \u201cWe could feel so much love and support in that box.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>The power of community</strong></p>\n<p>While the SMA community today is relatively large and diverse, there was a time when parents had little in the way of support or infrastructure.</p>\n<p>This was the case for Aniello and Rosa Cavallaro, who first learned that their son Sammy had type 2 SMA in May 2001, when he was nine-months- old. \u201cNobody knew what SMA was,\u201d says Rosa. \u201cThe doctors told us that they hadn\u2019t seen a case at the Montreal Children\u2019s Hospital in over 25 years.\u201d</p>\n<p>Like many parents who find themselves in this situation, the Cavallaros immediately turned to the internet, searching for whatever information they could find about SMA. It was there that they learned that an SMA conference was taking place in Chicago just a few weeks later.</p>\n<p>\u201cI flew down to the conference and I was really impressed with what they were doing,\u201d says Aniello.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeople read about it, they see it, but at the end of the day, nobody knows what you\u2019re going through unless they\u2019re going through it also,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why these conferences are so important. They give you hope\u2014they give people a lot of hope.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Staying positive\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>As any parent who has a child with a rare disease knows, staying positive in the face of so much uncertainty can be extremely difficult.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re seven months into it now and I don\u2019t know whether the fear and anxiety will ever really go away,\u201d says Emma. \u201cIt\u2019s the fear of what tomorrow will bring, because we don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to progress. That\u2019s the great thing about having other parents to talk to and being able to hear their experiences with SMA. You start to think that there might be a light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d</p>\n<p>This kind of reassurance can be invaluable to parents of children with serious and progressive diseases like SMA, according to Susi Vander Wyk, a Chilliwack, BC mother of twenty one-year-old Holli, and the Executive Director of <a href=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=4560426641&amp;iu=/7326/Tracking.Pixels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cure SMA Canada</a>. \u201cThere\u2019s a level of care and compassion that comes from being able to talk with someone who\u2019s also living within the world of the disease,\u201d she adds.</p>\n<p><strong>Paying it forward</strong></p>\n<p>As a parent of a child with SMA, Susi\u2019s initial experience with the disease was not unlike that of the Cavallaros.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen Holli was diagnosed, I didn\u2019t even have a computer,\u201d Susi recalls. \u201cAnd it was very isolating. It was difficult not knowing any other families who were also struggling with SMA.\u201d</p>\n<p>This experience led Susi down the road to becoming an SMA advocate. She founded a support group for parents of children with disabilities, fundraised tirelessly to raise money for research, ran summer camps for affected families, and, ultimately, helped grow the community to its current size and scale. She remains the key figure responsible for ensuring that the group has a unified voice when working with government and payers to secure access to lifesaving treatment.</p>\n<p>As the Rideouts have learned in the past seven months, the SMA community today reaches all corners of the country. \u201cThere are so many platforms for people to share their stories, reach out to other folks that have SMA, and learn about what\u2019s going on in research and drug development,\u201d says Emma. Emma recently joined the organization\u2019s board in hopes of being able to provide the same support to parents that she and Steve received from those before them.</p>\n<p><strong>The Rideout, Vander Wyk, and Cavallaro families are active members of Cure SMA Canada, the leading patient group advocating for access to treatment for SMA patients in Canada.

He&#8217;s eight years old and loves sports, animals and the outdoors. But Mason faces special challenges pursuing these interests because, like about one Canadian child in every six thousand, he has <a href=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=4560424238&amp;iu=/7326/Tracking.Pixels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spinal muscular atrophy</a> (SMA), a rare and progressive neuromuscular disorder.</p>\n<p>Mason was born a healthy baby and, for a while, there was no sign that anything was wrong. \u201cMason was a normal kid,\u201d says Jenna, mom to Mason and eleven-month-old Casey. \u201cHe hit all his milestones. He crawled and walked and did everything on cue. But when he walked, he had a bit of an awkward gait, a swagger in his hips.\u201d</p>\n<p>This and other small signs eventually worsened and led to a series of doctor&#8217;s visits, progressively further from the farm. Finally, after a five-day stay at a hospital in Kingston, Mason was diagnosed with SMA in 2011, just shy of his second birthday. \u201cI didn&#8217;t even know what SMA was before we got to Kingston,\u201d says Jenna. \u201cWhen they said that they thought he had a neuromuscular disorder called SMA, my first question was, \u2018How do we fix it?\u2019 I remember them saying, \u2018There&#8217;s no treatment. There&#8217;s no cure. And it&#8217;s progressive.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Mason&#8217;s family had to face the prospect of a future in which he would slowly lose what strength, mobility and independence he had acquired. Then, in 2016, the very first treatment for SMA hit the market in the United States and changed everything.</p>\n<p><strong>Hope where there was none</strong></p>\n<p>The new drug effectively converts an unused gene into a working copy of the gene that malfunctions in SMA patients. While it\u2019s not a cure, the results of the treatment can be dramatic. In many patients, progression of the disease halts entirely, and some even regain mobility milestones they had previously lost.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur best SMA friends are in Texas and their daughter, Kadence, is only a day apart in age from Mason,\u201d says Eddie, Mason\u2019s dad. \u201cHer parents fought hard with their insurance company and now she\u2019s been on the treatment steadily for almost a year. She\u2019s doing things she was never able to do before. For the first time, she can independently climb stairs. She can ride a bike.\u201d</p>\n<p>Children in Canada, however, continued to wait, as it took an additional six months for the treatment to be approved here. \u201cIt was hard watching her progress by leaps and bounds while Mason was still struggling at home, just because we live in Canada,\u201d says Jenna. \u201cWe were happy for them, of course, but we couldn\u2019t help asking why every child couldn\u2019t get access to this drug.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cWe&#8217;re running out of time\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>The fight didn&#8217;t end with Health Canada&#8217;s approval of the new treatment in June of 2017. As with many treatments for rare diseases, the costs can be too much to bear for most families, and both public and private payers have been slow to approve the treatment for reimbursement. As the months tick by, families like Mason&#8217;s feel the weight of lost time heavily. \u201cAt Mason&#8217;s age, it&#8217;s almost like we&#8217;re running out of time,\u201d says Jenna. \u201cHe&#8217;s at the age where he&#8217;s getting quite tall and gaining weight, and he&#8217;s no longer able to do the things he could before. We live on a country farm so it&#8217;s hard for him to do things, especially in the winter.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the time of our conversation in January, Mason&#8217;s treatment had finally been approved by his family&#8217;s private insurance company after a lengthy battle. By the time of publication, that treatment will be underway. When I asked Mason how he felt about the treatment, he answered simply: \u201cHappy and scared.\u201d</p>\n<p>For Mason, the thought of gaining even small amounts of additional mobility means the world. \u201cHe wants to help out around the farm,\u201d says Jenna. \u201cHonestly, his hopes and dreams right now are simply to be able to get up on his own if he falls, to go up a set of stairs himself and to get into his bed on his own\u2014things that we all take for granted.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mason and his family are very much looking forward to the rest of the year and the new opportunities that it\u2019ll bring. They&#8217;ve seen the results of the treatment in other children in the SMA community and, though cautious, they\u2019re optimistic. \u201cMost importantly,\u201d says Jenna, \u201cit gives us all hope and something to look forward to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Despite the very positive turn Mason&#8217;s story has taken, it\u2019s important to remember that there are others in Canada who are still in that painful waiting period, watching as their diseases continue to progress. The Stewarts have not forgotten them. \u201cIf anyone in Canada is looking for guidance on how to fight for their own children, we\u2019re going to help them,\u201d Jenna insists. \u201cI&#8217;m not going to stop fighting just because Mason got his treatment, when there are other children in Canada who are still waiting.\u201d</p>\n<p>In December, CDEC and INESSS published reimbursement recommendations for public funding in Canada. These recommendations are some of the most restrictive in the world to date, limiting access to a very small number of newly diagnosed patients. Unfortunately, for many hopeful patients like Mason, the reality of treatment may remain just out of reach.</p>\n<p><strong>The Stewart family are active members of Cure SMA Canada, the leading patient group dedicated to advocating for the SMA community in Canada.

(James Padolsey/Unsplash)</p></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/george-nicholas-277022\">George Nicholas</a>, Professor of Archaeology, <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/institutions/simon-fraser-university-1282\">Simon Fraser University</a></em></p>\n<p>Our knowledge of what the denizens of the animal kingdom are up to, especially when humans aren\u2019t around, has steadily increased over the last 50 years. For example, we know now that animals use tools in their daily lives. Chimps use twigs to fish for termites; sea otters break open shellfish on rocks they selected; octopi carry coconut shell halves to later use as shelters.</p>\n<p>The latest discovery has taken this assessment to new heights, literally. A team of researchers led by Mark Bonta and Robert Gosford in northern Australia has documented kites and falcons, colloquially termed \u201cfirehawks,\u201d <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2993/0278-0771-37.4.700\">intentionally carrying burning sticks to spread fire</a>. While it has long been known that birds will take advantage of natural fires that cause insects, rodents and reptiles to flee and thus increase feeding opportunities, that they would intercede to spread fire to unburned locales is astounding.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s thus no surprise that this study has <a href=\"https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/01/wildfires-birds-animals-australia/\">attracted great attention</a> as it adds intentionality and planning to the repertoire of non-human use of tools. Previous accounts of avian use of fire have been dismissed or at least viewed with some skepticism.</p>\n<p>While new to Western science, the behaviours of the nighthawks have long been known to the Alawa, MalakMalak, Jawoyn, and other Indigenous peoples of northern Australia whose ancestors occupied their lands for tens of thousands of years. Contrary to most scientific studies, Bonta and Gosford\u2019s team foregrounded their research in traditional Indigenous ecological knowledge. They also note that local awareness of the behaviour of the firehawks is ingrained within some of their ceremonial practices, beliefs and creation accounts.</p>\n<p>The worldwide attention given to the firehawks article provides an opportunity to explore the double standard that exists concerning the acceptance of Traditional Knowledge by practitioners of Western science.</p>\n<h2>Traditional knowledge</h2>\n<p>Our knowledge of the world comes from many sources. In my field, archaeologists have long depended upon ethnographic sources of information \u2014 detailed observations or information derived directly from communities studied \u2014 to help develop or test interpretations about past peoples\u2019 lives.</p>\n<p>In recent years, many scholars have become aware of the large body of information known as Traditional Knowledge (TK), Indigenous Knowledge (IK), or Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), amongst other terms. These knowledge systems, developed over countless generations, are based on individual and collectively learned experiences and explanations of the world, verified by elders, and conveyed and guided experiential learning, and by oral traditions and other means of record keeping.</p>\n<p>Traditional Knowledge has today become a highly valued source of information for archaeologists, ecologists, biologists, ethnobotanists, climatologists and others. This information ranges from medicinal properties of plants and insights into the value of biological diversity to caribou migration patterns and the effects of intentional burning of the landscape to manage particular resources. For example, some climatology studies have incorporated <em>Qaujimajatuqangit</em> (Inuit traditional knowledge) to explain changes in sea ice conditions observed over many generations.</p>\n<p>Despite the wide acknowledgement of their demonstrated value, many scientists continue to have had an uneasy alliance with TK and Indigenous oral histories. On the one hand, TK and other types of local knowledge are valued when they support or supplements archaeological, or other scientific evidence.</p>\n<p>However, when the situation is reversed \u2014 when Traditional Knowledge is seen to challenge scientific \u201ctruths\u201d \u2014 then its utility is questioned or dismissed as myth. Science is promoted as objective, quantifiable, and the foundation for \u201creal\u201d knowledge creation or evaluation while TK may be seen as anecdotal, imprecise and unfamiliar in form.</p>\n<h2>Multiple ways of knowing</h2>\n<p>Are Indigenous and Western systems of knowledge categorically antithetical? Or do they offer multiple points of entry into knowledge of the world, past and present? There are many cases where science and history are catching up with what Indigenous peoples have long known.</p>\n<p>In the past two decades, archaeologists and environmental scientists working in coastal British Columbia have come to recognize evidence of mariculture \u2014 the intentional management of marine resources \u2014 that pre-dates European settlement. Over the course of thousands of years, the ancestors of the Kwakwaka&#8217;wakw and other Indigenous groups there created and maintained what have become known as \u201cclam gardens\u201d \u2014 rock-walled, terrace-like constructions that provide ideal habit for butter clams and other edible shellfish.</p>\n<p>To the Kwakwaka&#8217;wakw, these were known as <em>loxiwey</em>, according to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10745-015-9743-3\">Clan Chief Adam Dick (<em>Kwaxsistalla</em>) who has shared this term and his knowledge of the practice with researchers</a>.</p>\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n<p><div style=\"width: 764px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/206252/original/file-20180213-118385-164169a.jpeg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" alt=\"\" width=\"754\" height=\"566\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kwaxsistalla Chief Adam Dick with a butter clam.

This resource management strategy reflects a sophisticated body of ecological understanding and practice that predates modern management systems by millennia.</p>\n<p>These published research studies now prove that Indigenous communities knew about mariculture for generations but Western scientists never asked them about it before. Once tangible remains were detected, it was clear mariculture management was in use for thousands of years. There is a move underway by various Indigenous communities in the region to restore and recreate clam gardens and put them back into use.</p>\n<p>A second example demonstrates how Indigenous oral histories correct inaccurate or incomplete historical accounts. There are significant differences between Lakota and Cheyenne accounts of what transpired at the Battle of Greasy Grass (Little Big Horn) in 1876, and the historical accounts that appeared soon after the battle by white commentators.</p>\n<p>The Lakota and Cheyenne can be considered more objective than white accounts of the battle that are tainted by Eurocentric bias. The <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/features/2016/red-horse/\">ledger drawings of Red Horse</a>, a Minneconjou Sioux participant in the battle, record precise details such as trooper\u2019s uniforms, the location of wounds on horses, and the distribution of Indian and white casualties.</p>\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n<p><div style=\"width: 764px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/206439/original/file-20180214-174966-1vnnbpt.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" alt=\"\" width=\"754\" height=\"377\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Untitled from the Red Horse Pictographic Account of the Battle of the Little Bighorn, 1881.

What this work revealed was a new, more accurate history of the battle that validated many elements of the Native American oral histories and accompanying pictographs and drawings of the events. However, without the archaeological evidence, many historians gave limited credence to the accounts obtained from the participating Native American warriors.</p>\n<p>These examples, along with the firehawks study, demonstrate the reliability of Indigenous knowledge.</p>\n<h2>Opportunities at the intersection</h2>\n<p>As ways of knowing, Western and Indigenous Knowledge share several important and fundamental attributes. Both are constantly verified through repetition and verification, inference and prediction, empirical observations and recognition of pattern events.</p>\n<p>While some actions leave no physical evidence (e.g. clam cultivation), and some experiments can\u2019t be replicated (e.g. cold fusion), in the case of Indigenous knowledge, the absence of \u201cempirical evidence\u201d can be damning in terms of wider acceptance.</p>\n<p>Some types of Indigenous knowledge simply fall outside the realm of prior Western understanding. In contrast to Western knowledge, which tends to be text based, reductionist, hierarchical and dependent on categorization (putting things into categories), Indigenous science does not strive for a universal set of explanations but is particularistic in orientation and often contextual.</p>\n<p>One key attribute of Western science is developing and then testing hypotheses to ensure rigor and replicability in interpreting empirical observations or making predictions. Although hypothesis testing is not a feature of TEK, rigor and replicability are not absent.</p>\n<p>Whether or not traditional knowledge systems and scientific reasoning are mutually supportive, even contradictory lines of evidence have value. Employing TK-based observations and explanations within multiple working hypotheses ensures consideration of a variety of predictive, interpretive or explanatory possibilities not constrained by Western expectation or logic. And hypotheses incorporating traditional knowledge-based information can lead the way toward unanticipated insights.</p>\n<p>The travels of <a href=\"http://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/aborig/fp/fpz2f21e.shtml\">Glooscap</a>, a major figure in Abenaki oral history and worldview, are found throughout the Mi&#8217;kmaw homeland of the Maritime provinces of eastern Canada.

Some do appreciate the verification, and there are partnerships developing worldwide with Indigenous knowledge holders and Western scientists working together.</p>\n<p>This includes Traditional Ecological Knowledge informing government policies on resource management in some instances. But it is nonetheless problematic when their knowledge, which has been dismissed for so long by so many, becomes a valuable data set or used selectively by academics and others.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/90291/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />To return to the firehawks example, one way to look at this is that the scientists confirmed what the Indigenous peoples have long known about the birds\u2019 use of fire.

Feb. 14, 2018. (AP Photo/Joel Auerbach)</p></div>\n<p>PARKLAND, Fla. \u2014 An orphaned 19-year-old with a troubled past and an AR-15 rifle was charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder Thursday morning after being questioned for hours by state and federal authorities following the deadliest school shooting in the U.S. in five years.</p>\n<p>Fifteen wounded survivors were hospitalized as bodies were recovered from inside and around Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.</p>\n<p>Just before the shooting broke out, some students thought they were having another fire drill.</p>\n<p>Such an exercise had forced them to leave their classrooms hours earlier. So when the alarm went off Wednesday afternoon shortly before they were to be dismissed, they once again filed out into the hallways.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s when police say Nikolas Cruz, equipped with a gas mask, smoke grenades and multiple magazines of ammunition, opened fire with a semi-automatic weapon, killing 17 people and sending hundreds of students fleeing into the streets. It was the nation&#8217;s deadliest school shooting since a gunman attacked an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, more than five years ago.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our district is in a tremendous state of grief and sorrow,&#8221; said Robert Runcie, superintendent of the school district in Parkland, about an hour&#8217;s drive north of Miami. &#8220;It is a horrible day for us.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/numerous-fatalities-in-florida-high-school-shooting-shooter-in-custody/\">\u2018Numerous fatalities\u2019 in Florida school attack; shooter former student</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Authorities offered no immediate details about Cruz or his possible motive, except to say that he had been kicked out of the high school, which has about 3,000 students. Students who knew him described a volatile teenager whose strange behaviour had caused others to end friendships with him.</p>\n<p>Cruz&#8217;s mother Lynda Cruz died of pneumonia on Nov. 1 neighbours, friends and family members said, according to the Sun Sentinel. Cruz and her husband, who died of a heart attack several years ago, adopted Nikolas and his biological brother, Zachary, after the couple moved from Long Island in New York to Broward County.</p>\n<p>The boys were left in the care of a family friend after their mother died, family member Barbara Kumbatovich, of Long Island, said.</p>\n<p>Unhappy there, Nikolas Cruz asked to move in with a friend&#8217;s family in northwest Broward. The family agreed and Cruz moved in around Thanksgiving. According to the family&#8217;s lawyer, who did not identify them, they knew that Cruz owned the AR-15 but made him keep it locked up in a cabinet. He did have the key, however.</p>\n<p>Jim Lewis said the family is devastated and didn&#8217;t see this coming. They are co-operating with authorities, he said.</p>\n<p>Victoria Olvera, a 17-year-old junior at the school, said Cruz was expelled last school year because he got into a fight with his ex-girlfriend&#8217;s new boyfriend. She said he had been abusive to his girlfriend.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/2017-is-the-deadliest-year-for-mass-shootings-in-u-s-modern-history/\">2017 is the deadliest year for mass shootings in U.S. modern history</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;I think everyone had in their minds if anybody was going to do it, it was going to be him,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>Cruz was taken into custody without a fight about an hour after the shooting in a residential neighbourhood about a mile away. He had multiple magazines of ammunition, authorities said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s catastrophic. There really are no words,&#8221; said Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel.</p>\n<p>Frantic parents rushed to the school to find SWAT team members and ambulances surrounding the huge campus and emergency workers who appeared to be treating the wounded on sidewalks. Students who hadn&#8217;t run began leaving in a single-file line with their hands over their heads as officers urged them to evacuate quickly.</p>\n<p>Hearing loud bangs as the shooter fired, many of the students inside hid under desks or in closets, and barricaded doors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We were in the corner, away from the windows,&#8221; said freshman Max Charles, who said he heard five gunshots. &#8220;The teacher locked the door and turned off the light. I thought maybe I could die or something.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As he was leaving the building, he saw four dead students and one dead teacher. He said he was relieved when he finally found his mother.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was happy that I was alive,&#8221; Max said. &#8220;She was crying when she saw me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Noah Parness, a 17-year-old junior, said he and the other students calmly went outside to their fire-drill areas when he suddenly heard popping sounds.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/gun-violence-isnt-just-a-u-s-problem-and-canada-isnt-immune/\">Gun violence isn\u2019t just a U.S. problem\u2014and Canada isn\u2019t immune</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;We saw a bunch of teachers running down the stairway, and then everybody shifted and broke into a sprint,&#8221; Parness said. &#8220;I hopped a fence.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Most of the fatalities were inside the building, though some victims were found fatally shot outside, the sheriff said.</p>\n<p>Sen. Bill Nelson told CNN that Cruz had pulled the fire alarm &#8220;so the kids would come pouring out of the classrooms into the hall.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;And there the carnage began,&#8221; said Nelson, who said he was briefed by the FBI.</p>\n<p>The scene was reminiscent of the Newtown attack, which shocked even a country numbed by the regularity of school shootings. The Dec. 14, 2012, assault at Sandy Hook Elementary School killed 26 people: 20 first-graders and six staff members. The 20-year-old gunman, who also fatally shot his mother in her bed, then killed himself.</p>\n<p>Not long after Wednesday&#8217;s attack in Florida, Michael Nembhard was sitting in his garage on a cul-de-sac when he saw a young man in a burgundy shirt walking down the street. In an instant, a police cruiser pulled up, and officers jumped out with guns drawn.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All I heard was &#8216;Get on the ground! Get on the ground!'&#8221; Nembhard said. He said Cruz did as he was told.</p>\n<p>The school was to be closed for the rest of the week.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/florida-teen-charged-with-17-murder-counts-after-school-shooting/\">Florida teen charged with 17 murder counts after school shooting</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/news/florida-teen-charged-with-17-murder-counts-after-school-shooting/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>8</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Backlash as Max Stern exhibit dubbed &#8216;Too Canadian&#8217; for Dusseldorf</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/backlash-as-max-stern-exhibit-dubbed-too-canadian-for-dusseldorf/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/backlash-as-max-stern-exhibit-dubbed-too-canadian-for-dusseldorf/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 00:38:14 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Maclean's]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Arts]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Max Stern]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1100373</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>A German mayor's meddling in a landmark show on Max Stern\u2019s Nazi art loss has a new focus: downplaying its Montreal roots</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/backlash-as-max-stern-exhibit-dubbed-too-canadian-for-dusseldorf/\">Backlash as Max Stern exhibit dubbed &#8216;Too Canadian&#8217; for Dusseldorf</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_1100377\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1100377\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB14_ANGEL_STERN_POST01.jpg\" alt=\"Seven Old Master and Nineteenth Century paintings that were looted by the Nazi's are unveiled at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, May 20, 2009.

The works are to be part of the Stern exhibition \u2013 if it happens. (Christinne Muschi/Reuters)</p></div>\n<p>In the late days of 2017, the German city of Dusseldorf became the unlikely centre of a scandal that outraged art circles and the international Jewish community. Dusseldorf mayor Thomas Geisel cancelled an exhibition honouring the Canadian art dealer Max Stern, who before immigrating to Montreal was forced by the Gestapo to sell over 200 paintings at a 1937 auction. Today, the Max Stern Restitution Project, founded in Stern\u2019s name and based at Concordia University, is one of the world\u2019s most influential organizations dedicated to reclaiming Nazi-looted art.</p>\n<p>The exhibition \u201cMax Stern: From Dusseldorf to Montreal,\u201d was to open at his city\u2019s Stadtmuseum before travelling to Haifa\u2019s Museum of Art and Montreal\u2019s McCord Museum this year\u2014until Geisel pulled the plug on the show last November.\u00a0 He then flip-flopped on his decision on Dec. 21 following an outpouring of international outrage, including pressure from Germany\u2019s culture minister Monika Gr\u00fctters, who called the mayor\u2019s actions \u201cbeyond regrettable\u201d adding that exhibitions exposing Nazi wrongs \u201care more necessary than ever at the current time.\u201d Dusseldorf\u2019s cultural office then gave official word that the show would be revived.</p>\n<p>However, recent events suggest that the real story, in which Canada plays a key role, is still unfolding. Despite Geisel\u2019s recent promise to reinstate \u201cMax Stern: From Dusseldorf to Montreal,\u201d he has yet to fix a date for the show. Moreover, if the exhibition does go forward the mayor has been clear that it will be in a different format from its original, which he says was \u201ctoo Canadian.\u201d</p>\n<p>If the Canadian art cognoscenti are unimpressed with that explanation, they\u2019re not the only ones. According to Willi Korte, the Bavarian-born Washington-based lawyer, historian, and restitution expert, \u201cthis is an elaborate stall tactic\u201d that allows a politician to save face in a city deeply divided on the subject of returning Nazi-looted art to its original owners.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>FROM 1966: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/max-stern-head-of-the-house-that-art-built/\">Max Stern: Head of the house that art built</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Geisel\u2019s initial reason for cancelling the exhibition was that it could not take place because the Stern estate has claims against Dusseldorf public institutions, which it maintains has paintings that Stern had to give up under Gestapo orders. While Geisel seemed to soften his stance in the wake of the backlash, he has made no efforts to work with Canadians to ensure that the show is realized.</p>\n<p>In late January the mayor visited Washington, D.C. and then New York City to make amends with his most vehement detractors, including Georgetown University professor\u00a0Dr. Ori\u00a0Z.\u00a0Soltes and Manhattan\u2019s Holocaust Claims Processing Office. Oddly, the mayor\u2019s North American tour did not include a trip to Montreal, the home of the Max Stern Restitution Project, where he could have met with its key stakeholders.</p>\n<p>The bypassing of Canada is raising eyebrows about the mayor\u2019s promise to realize an exhibition that has been in the works for more than three years. Unless Geisel cooperates with Stern\u2019s representatives, Stoltes mused in an interview after his meeting with the mayor last month, \u201cHow will this new reinstated exhibition come about?\u201d</p>\n<p>The genesis of \u00a0\u201cMax Stern: From Dusseldorf to Montreal\u201d was the Stadtmuseum\u2019s April 2014 return of <em>Self-Portrait of the Artist</em> by the 19th-century artist Wilhelm\u00a0von\u00a0Schadow. The painting was one of more than 200 paintings, inventory Stern sold involuntarily from his Rhine Valley dealership, the Galerie Stern. Under Gestapo order in 1937 he was forced to auction off the works from his family business at depressed prices after Nazi law revoked his professional credentials as an art dealer because he was Jewish.</p>\n<p>In 2011, when Stern\u2019s heirs located <em>Self-Portrait of the Artist</em> at the Stadtmuseum, the museum\u2019s director, Susanne Anna was unaware of the work\u2019s problematic history. She then committed herself to ensuring the painting\u2019s restitution and announced to the international press that her museum would organize an exhibition about how the Galerie Stern had once been a vibrant component of German cultural life before it was erased from history along with countless other Jewish establishments.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1100463 alignright\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Max_Stern.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"575\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Max_Stern.jpg 620w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Max_Stern-300x278.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Max_Stern-375x348.jpg 375w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Max_Stern-606x562.jpg 606w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /></p>\n<p>For three years Anna planned the exhibition\u2019s curatorial direction in concert with the world\u2019s leading Stern experts, the National Gallery of Canada archivist Philip Dombowsky (who oversees Stern\u2019s papers) and Catherine Mackenzie, who curated an exhibition on Stern in 2006.</p>\n<p>She also involved Geisel in the exhibition from the start. Marnie Stein, the principal of a Jewish grade school in C\u00f4te Saint-Luc told <em>Maclean\u2019s</em> how in 2015, the mayor had visited Les \u00c9coles juives populaires et Les \u00c9coles Peretz, along with Susanne Anna to establish a partnership between the school and the Max Schule, an elementary school in Dusseldorf. As a pedagogical component of the exhibition, two grade three classes\u2014one in Dusseldorf, the other in Montreal\u2014would do twin studies on Max Stern and what his life meant to both their respective countries.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen Geisel visited the school he came across as likeable, engaging and committed to the issue,\u201d said Stein, \u201cThe meaning of his visit was not lost on the students, many of whom are offspring of Holocaust survivors.\u201d They presented him with a Habs jersey with his name on the back. Students felt hopeful and excited about the plan for the two schools to collectively create art and research that would be featured in the travelling Stern exhibition. It was a model, said Stein, for how \u201cdespite great historical adversity, in remembering the past they could collectively forge a better path in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stein says she finds it \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d that she has received no communication about what is happening with the exhibition. Students want to know, \u201cAre we out of the picture?\u201d</p>\n<p>Equally worrying for some is that the curatorial vision for the promised exhibition is itself now under scrutiny. Last week, Dusseldorf\u2019s Cultural Affairs Officer Hans-Georg Lohe\u00a0announced that the 78-year-old renowned art historian Uwe Schneede will be involved in an\u00a0unspecified role on the \u201cinitially canceled Max\u00a0Stern exhibition.\u201d In a phone interview, Geisel explained the show had to be \u201cmodified\u201d with new additions to the curatorial team\u2014\u201cfor balance,\u201d because the exhibition\u2019s initial conceptualization did not have enough German representation.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/saving-italy-the-race-to-rescue-a-nations-treasures-from-the-nazis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Race to Rescue Italy&#8217;s Treasures from the Nazis</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>However, the reason Anna looked outside of Dusseldorf in creating the exhibition in the first place is precisely because there are no leading scholars on Stern in Germany. After being forced to flee his home country, Stern took his possessions and papers to Montreal, which became an important centre for study on him and his work.</p>\n<p>Anna, Dombowsky, and Mackenzie created a show to focus on Stern\u2019s life in Germany, where he ran one of the country\u2019s most successful galleries, as well as Montreal, where he rebuilt his life and became director of the Dominion Gallery of Fine Art, selling contemporary Canadian painters at a time when it was more fashionable to collect European artists. Despite Stern\u2019s success and fame in Canada he never shared details of the losses he incurred in Nazi\u00a0Europe. Following his death, in 1987, Stern\u2019s executors\u2014Montreal\u2019s\u00a0Concordia\u00a0and McGill Universities and the Hebrew University in Jerusalem\u2014learned of his past and established the Max Stern Art Restitution Project. To date the organization has reclaimed 16 paintings, working at a rate of approximately one recovery per year since it was launched in 2002.</p>\n<p>The Max Stern Art Restitution Project has also become one of the world\u2019s most important voices in the study of Holocaust-era art looting, setting precedents such as its 2008 restitution of <em>The Girl from the Sabine Mountains</em>, by Franz Xaver Winterhalter, which was the subject of a landmark U.S. legal case, in which U.S. District Chief Judge Mary Lisi ruled \u201cDr. Stern\u2019s relinquishment of his property was anything but voluntary.\u201d The decision was historic, because it recognized that the majority of European Jews lost their artworks through Nazi coercion, acknowledging for the first time that this forcible selling of art was tantamount to theft.</p>\n<p>Like Stein, the original curatorial team for the exhibition has received no information about the show\u2019s new manifestation, its scope and vision, or whether they will be involved in it. By email, Mackenzie wrote that she still hopes to play a part in \u201cbringing the story of the Stern family\u2019s presence in various art worlds to the attention of an audience in Germany.\u201d However, as she explained, \u201cthere has been no approval from Dusseldorf\u2019s cultural department of funding for the revived project.\u201d</p>\n<p>As for Canadian-based funding for the exhibition, this, too, is a potential challenge. A key sponsor of the show was to have been Montreal\u2019s Jewish Community Foundation (JCF). Its support, however, was predicated on the plan to take the exhibition to Montreal\u2019s McCord Museum. \u201cSince the show was cancelled and then re-announced, we haven\u2019t heard anything,\u201d says Robert Kleinman, executive vice-president of the JCF. Until the JCF has more information on the revised exhibition plan and its confirmed venues, he says, \u201cno funds are forthcoming.\u201d</p>\n<p>In an interview, Suzanne\u00a0Sauvage,\u00a0McCord\u2019s\u00a0president and chief executive officer said that although she is hopeful that the show will arrive in Canada, its status is \u201ctentative, because Dusseldorf is looking for new curators and it will have to find new financing.\u201d In order for the show to happen in 2018 or 2019, these things should be in place by now. \u201cShows are organized years in advance,\u201d</p>\n<p>Art world watchers are starting to ask how it is that that Geisel can make promises to hold this politically freighted exhibition, which now seems unlikely to be delivered as it was originally intended. Not to mention how a mayor in any democratic country can hold this much power.</p>\n<p>One answer lies in the comments that Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, gave on Feb. 1 in Berlin on the current state of art restitution in Germany. \u201cThe huge gap\u00a0between official announcements and\u00a0actual deeds must end,\u201d said Lauder. He added that there will be no justice until, the federal government of Germany takes responsibility and makes restitution \u201ca top priority at the state\u00a0and municipal levels.\u201d Geisel was in the audience at Lauder\u2019s talk. But he has yet to offer any further insights about Dusseldorf\u2019s plans for the Stern exhibition, leaving its future still very much in question.</p>\n<p>Yet the topic is one that the mayor can\u2019t ignore. Last week the heirs of Kurt Grawi, who fled Germany under Nazi persecution, made a claim on the painting <em>F\u00fcchse</em> by the Expressionist master Franz Marc, one of the key works in Dusseldorf&#8217;s Kunstpalast. (It\u2019s valued at up to 14 million euros.) With Nazi-looted art remaining an issue that is tied to his city, Geisel is under more scrutiny than ever.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Sara Angel is a restitution scholar and journalist.

Here is a transcript of what Trudeau told the House of Commons.</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;I would like to begin by recognizing that we are as we are every day in this House on the ancestral land of the Algonquin people. En septembre dernier aux Nations Unies j\u2019ai pris la parole devant des d\u00e9l\u00e9gations des quatre coins du monde.</p>\n<p>Je leur ai fait part des dures v\u00e9rit\u00e9s au sujet de la relation longue et complexe qu\u2019entretient le Canada avec les Premi\u00e8res Nations, les Inuit et la Nation M\u00e9tis. J\u2019ai parl\u00e9 de l\u2019approche coloniale qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens, une loi discriminatoire et paternaliste.</p>\n<p>A colonial approach that systematically ignored the history of the M\u00e9tis Nation and denied its people their rights and that in the name of Canadian sovereignty forced the relocation of entire Inuit communities, starving individuals, uprooting families and causing generations of harm.</p>\n<p>Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements dont j\u2019ai parl\u00e9 sont j\u2019en suis convaincu bien connus de tous les d\u00e9put\u00e9s de cette Chambre mais ce qui est remarquables, M. le Pr\u00e9sident, c\u2019est de quel point ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements tragiques sont aussi bien connus des Canadiens. You see I just finished a series of town hall visits in communities all across Canada.</p>\n<p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/moving-from-talk-to-action-on-indigenous-affairs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Moving from talk to action on Indigenous affairs</a></strong></p>\n<p>Everywhere I went there was at least one person who wanted to know what our government is doing to combat racism, to help advance reconciliation, to improve the quality of life for Indigenous peoples.</p>\n<p>There were questions about fishing rights, land claims and pipeline approvals, questions about the national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous when and girls, about clean water and about the alarming number of Indigenous children in foster care.</p>\n<p>These were thoughtful questions Mr. Speaker and it was immediately clear every time these kinds of questions were asked the room leaned in to hear. This was in part a show of support for the people who stood up and asked some tough questions but it was also a signal that these are questions that Canadians want answered, questions that strike right at the heart of who we are and what kind of country we want to be.<br />\nOne of those questions is how we as a government recognize and implement the rights of Indigenous peoples. We\u2019ve seen those questions grow in number and intensity in just these past few days as more and more Canadians come to grips with the fact that we have so much more work to do.</p>\n<p>More work to push back against the systemic racism that is the lived reality for so many Indigenous peoples, more work to deal with the fact that too many feel and fear that our country and its institutions will never deliver the fairness, justice and real reconciliation that Indigenous peoples deserve.</p>\n<p>There is also reason to be hopeful Mr. Speaker. Yesterday I had the honour of spending some time with Colten Boushie\u2019s family, with his mum Debbie, cousin Jade and uncle Alec and through all their grief and anger and frustration their focus was not on themselves and the tragedy they just endured but on how we must work together to make the system and our institutions better, better for Indigenous youth, for Indigenous families and for all Canadians.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/the-liberals-plans-for-indigenous-reconciliation-are-just-beads-and-trinkets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Liberals\u2019 plans for Indigenous reconciliation are just beads and trinkets</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>We have a responsibility to do better, to be better, to do our best to make sure that no family has to endure what they went through. Mr. Speaker, the criminal justice system is just one place in which reforms are urgently needed.</p>\n<p>Reforms are needed to ensure that among other things Indigenous peoples might once again have confidence in a system that has failed them all too often in the past. That is why we will bring forward broad based concrete reforms to the criminal justice system including changes to how juries are selected.</p>\n<p>Il est \u00e9vident M. le Pr\u00e9sident que les peuples autochtones et tous les Canadiens savent que le temps est plus que venu pour un changement. En m\u00eame temps certains voient les engagements ambitieux de notre gouvernement avec une certaine m\u00e9fiance. Si vous consid\u00e9rez la fa\u00e7on dont les choses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9r\u00e9es par le pass\u00e9 c\u2019est difficile de dire honn\u00eatement que cette m\u00e9fiance n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9e.</p>\n<p>Apr\u00e8s tout ce n\u2019est pas comme si nous \u00e9tions le premier gouvernement \u00e0 reconnaitre le besoin d\u2019apporter des changements et \u00e0 promettre que nous ferions les choses diff\u00e9remment.</p>\n<p>Plus de vingt ans se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9s depuis que la Commission Royale sur les peuples autochtones a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 la reconnaissance des peuples autochtones comme nations se gouvernant elles-m\u00eames et occupant une place unique au pays.</p>\n<p>Plus de trente ans se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9s depuis le rapport Penner et les conf\u00e9rences des Premiers Ministres sur les droits des peuples autochtones. Last year marked thirty-five years since aboriginal and treaty rights were recognized and affirmed through Section 35 of the Constitution Act. You might recall Mr. Speaker that the government of the day led by my father did not intend to include these rights at the outset.</p>\n<p>It was the outspoken advocacy of First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis peoples supported by non-Indigenous Canadians that forced that government to reconsider. Imagine what that must have felt like Mr. Speaker to have fought so long, so hard against colonialism, rallying your communities, reaching out to Canadians, riding the Constitution express and in the end to finally be recognized and included, to see your rights enshrined and protected in the foundational document upon which Canada\u2019s democracy rests.</p>\n<p>Now imagine the mounting disappointment, the all too unsurprising and familiar heartache and the rising tide of anger when governments that had promised so much did so little to keep their word. You see Mr. Speaker the challenge then as now is that while Section 35 recognizes and affirms aboriginal and treaty rights, those rights have not been implemented by our governments.</p>\n<p>The work to give life to Section 35 was supposed to be done together with First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis peoples and while there has been some success, progress has not been sustained nor significant. So, over time, it too often feel to the courts to pick up the pieces and fill in the gaps.</p>\n<p>More precisely, instead of outright recognizing and affirming Indigenous rights as we promised we would Indigenous peoples were forced to prove time and time again through costly and drawn out court challenges that their rights existed, must be recognized and implemented.</p>\n<p>Les peoples autochtones comme tous les Canadiens savent que \u00e7a doit changer et nous le savons aussi. C\u2019est donc pourquoi nous travaillons fort depuis deux ans pour renouveler la relation que nous entretenons avec les peuples autochtones, une relation fond\u00e9e sur la reconnaissance des droits, le respect, la collaboration et le partenariat.</p>\n<p>Nous sommes sur la bonne voie. We endorsed the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples without qualification and committed to its full implementation including with government support for Bill C262.</p>\n<p>We engaged in new recognition of rights and self-determination negotiations where the government and Indigenous peoples worked together on the priorities Indigenous partners say are necessary to advance their vision of self-determination.</p>\n<p>We signed agreements with First Nations, Inuit and the M\u00e9tis Nation outlining how we will work together to identify each community\u2019s distinct priorities and how we will work together to develop solutions. We established a working group of Ministers to review our federal laws, policies and operational practices to ensure the Crown is meeting its constitutional obligations and adhering to international human rights standards including the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.</p>\n<p>To guide the work of decolonizing Canadian laws and policies we adopted principles respecting Canada\u2019s relationship with Indigenous peoples. Pour pr\u00e9server, prot\u00e9ger et revitaliser les langues autochtones nous travaillons avec des partenaires autochtones pour \u00e9laborer de fa\u00e7on conjointe une loi sur les langues des Premi\u00e8res Nations, des Inuit et des M\u00e9tis.</p>\n<p>Nous avons apport\u00e9 des changements en vue de reconnaitre les droits autochtones et les connaissances traditionnelles en plus d\u2019inclure davantage les peuples autochtones lorsqu\u2019il y a des d\u00e9veloppements dans leurs communaut\u00e9s. These efforts are an important start Mr. Speaker but they are just a start.</p>\n<p>To truly renew the relationship between Canada and Indigenous peoples not just for today but for the next 150 years and beyond, we need a comprehensive and far-reaching approach. We need a government wide shift in how we do things. We need to both recognize and implement Indigenous rights because the truth is Mr. Speaker, until we get this part right we won\u2019t have lasting success on the concrete outcomes that we know mean so much to everyone.</p>\n<p>Indigenous peoples in Canada should be able to drink the water that comes out of their taps. They should be able to go to sleep in homes that are safe and not overcrowded. Indigenous children should be able to stay with their families and communities where they are known and loved and Indigenous youth should not grow up surrounded by the things that place them at elevated risk for suicide, things like poverty, abuse and limited access to a good education and good healthcare.</p>\n<p>All of these things demand real positive action, action that must include and be grounded in the full recognition and implementation of Indigenous rights. We need to get to a place where Indigenous peoples in Canada are in control of their own destiny, making their own decisions about their future.</p>\n<p>Today I am pleased to announce that the government will develop in full partnership with First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis people a new recognition and implementation of Indigenous rights framework that will include new ways to recognize and implement Indigenous rights.</p>\n<p>This will include new recognition and implementation of rights legislation. Going forward recognition of rights will guide all government interactions with Indigenous peoples. The contents of the framework that we build together will be determined through a national engagement led by the Minister of Crown Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs with support from the Minister of Justice.</p>\n<p>Plus t\u00f4t j\u2019ai cit\u00e9 de nombreux rapports ainsi que plusieurs \u00e9tudes des consultations pass\u00e9es. Je comprends que certaines personnes verront toute consultation future comme \u00e9tant une autre \u00e9tape visant \u00e0 ralentir la lutte pour l\u2019autod\u00e9termination des peuples autochtones.</p>\n<p>Mais soyons clairs M. le Pr\u00e9sident, aussi responsable, bien intentionn\u00e9e ou r\u00e9fl\u00e9chie soit-elle une solution propos\u00e9e qui ne vient que d\u2019Ottawa ne servira pas \u00e0 grande chose. Nous comprenons que les peuples autochtones ont h\u00e2te d\u2019amorcer eux-m\u00eames le travail consid\u00e9rable de reb\u00e2tir leurs nations et leurs institutions.</p>\n<p>En tant que gouvernement notre travail consiste \u00e0 appuyer, \u00e0 accompagner et \u00e0 travailler en partenariat avec les Premi\u00e8res Nations, les Inuit et les M\u00e9tis pour \u00e9tablir le cadre et leur donner les outils dont ils ont besoin \u00e0 mesure qu\u2019ils tracent leur chemin ensemble avec tous les Canadiens.<br />\nWe\u2019ll also be engaging the provinces and territories and non-Indigenous Canadians, people from civil society, from industry and the business community and the public at large because all Canadians have a stake in getting this right.</p>\n<p>While the results of this engagement will guide what the final framework looks like we believe that as a starting point it should include new legislation and a policy that would make the recognition and implementation of rights the basis for all relations between Indigenous peoples and the federal government moving forward.</p>\n<p>This framework gives us the opportunity to build new mechanisms, to recognize Indigenous governments and ensure rigorous full and meaningful implementation of treaties and other agreements. With this framework we have a chance to develop new tools to support the rebuilding of Indigenous communities, nations and governments and advance self-determination including the inherent right of self-government.</p>\n<p>This framework could establish new ways to resolve disputes so that collaboration becomes the new standard and conflict the exception rather than the rule. By including tools that oblige the federal government to be more transparent and accountable we can build greater trust between Indigenous peoples and government.</p>\n<p>Enfin gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ce nouveau cadre nous pourrons mieux aligner les lois et les politiques canadiennes sur la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones que le gouvernement soutien sans r\u00e9serve.</p>\n<p>Nous croyons qu\u2019un cadre comportant des mesures comme celles-ci donnera enfin suite \u00e0 bon nombre des recommandations formul\u00e9es par la Commission Royale sur les peuples autochtones et par la Commission de V\u00e9rit\u00e9 et de R\u00e9conciliation et dans d\u2019innombrables autres \u00e9tudes et rapports conclus au fil des ans.</p>\n<p>Mr. Speaker, some may worry that this ambitious approach may require reopening the Constitution. That is not true. In fact we are finally fully embracing and giving life to the existing Section 35 of the Constitution and so we\u2019ll replace policies like the comprehensive land claims policy and the inherent right to self-government policy with new and better approaches that respect the distinctions between First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis peoples.</p>\n<p>This will give greater confidence and certainty to everyone involved. The federal government\u2019s absence over generations in recognizing and implementing Indigenous rights has resulted in social and economic exclusion, uncertainty and litigation when our shared focus should have always been on creating prosperity and opportunity for everyone.</p>\n<p>Better opportunities for Indigenous peoples and certainty for Indigenous youth are precisely what we hope to achieve through this framework. Engagement will continue through the spring but it is our firm intention to have the framework introduced later this year and implemented before the next election.</p>\n<p>Ce travail mettra \u00e0 contribution non seulement le gouvernement mais aussi ce Parlement. Il y aura des travaux des comit\u00e9s, des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 entendre et des d\u00e9bats vigoureux et ce dans les deux Chambres. L\u2019histoire de la relation qu\u2019entretient le Canada avec les peuples autochtone transcende tous les gouvernements M. le Pr\u00e9sident.</p>\n<p>La Loi sur les Indiens a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e dans cette Chambre tout comme l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019article 35. Maintenant en tant que Parlement nous avons l\u2019occasion et surtout la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019enfin mettre en \u0153uvre l\u2019article 35. M. le Pr\u00e9sident, nous savons tous que nous ne pouvons pas effacer le pass\u00e9.</p>\n<p>Nous ne pouvons pas retrouver ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 perdu. Ce que nous pouvons faire, ce que nous devons faire c\u2019est nous engager \u00e0 \u00eatre meilleur, \u00e0 faire mieux. Pour commencer faisons ce que la loi constitutionnelle nous oblige \u00e0 faire depuis presque quarante ans. We will work together to do away with legislation and policies built to serve colonial interests.</p>\n<p>We will work together as we follow through on our commitments to build a new and better relationship. Mr. Speaker, Indigenous Canadians and all Canadians are ready for change, ready for a new relationship based on recognition, rights, respect, cooperation and partnership.</p>\n<p>With a recognition and implementation of rights framework we can build that new relationship together. It won\u2019t be easy Mr. Speaker. Nothing worth doing ever is. It will be worth it. It will be worth it because we will have taken more steps towards righting historical wrongs. It will be worth it because we will have replaced apathy with action, ignorance with understanding and conflict with respect.</p>\n<p>We will have laid the foundation for real and lasting change, the kind of change that can only come when we fully recognize and implement Indigenous rights. Together we will take concrete action to build a better future, a better Canada for Indigenous peoples and for all Canadians.

(Jason Franson/CP)</p></div>\n<p><em>David Milward is an associate professor of law at the University of Manitoba. He is the author of the award-winning book, </em>Aboriginal Justice and the Charter<em>, as well as numerous other publications in the field of Indigenous justice, Indigenous rights and the law of evidence.</em></p>\n<p>There is outrage in Indigenous communities over the recent acquittal of Saskatchewan farmer Gerald Stanley of all charges <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/the-gerald-stanley-verdict-is-a-blow-to-reconciliation-and-a-terrifying-one-at-that/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">relating to the shooting death of a young Indigenous man named Colten Boushie.</a> Though the jury heard that the fatal wound was indicative of an execution-style shot to the back of the head at very close range\u2014and that Stanley&#8217;s gun provided no indication that a hang fire accident could have occurred as he claimed, according to a Crown expert witness\u2014he was found innocent. Juries are frequently skeptical of claims of guns accidentally going off in murder cases; that skepticism was not to be found in this case.</p>\n<p>Did the jury simply disregard the law and the evidence in order to give Stanley a free pass to murder an Indigenous man? It is easy for Indigenous communities to come to that conclusion, but simply no way to prove that it was the case. Jury deliberations are kept secret by law, and can never become the basis for a factual appeal. There are sound reasons for this restriction: It is meant to create a safe space for juries to conduct their deliberations free of public condemnations and pressures. However, in the absence of information, that space becomes a ripe field for speculation, and those outraged have many historical reasons to suspect the worst.</p>\n<p>Indeed, this episode is just the latest punctuation mark in the feelings of many Indigenous people that the Canadian criminal justice system is fundamentally racist against them in multiple ways.</p>\n<p>The lead-up to the trial itself sparked suspicions. Secret jury deliberation can lead to jury nullification, when the jury disregards the law and the evidence and renders a verdict based purely on its sympathies and prejudices. Defence lawyers will elect a trial by jury instead of by a judge alone when they are aware that their clients&#8217; defences stand on shaky legal merit, and Scott Spencer, Stanley&#8217;s lawyer, chose to go the jury route. The defence team also deployed peremptory challenges, which can be used by both sides for purely strategic reasons with no imperative to justify their use, to nix Indigenous people from being considered as jurors. Indigenous exclusion from juries has been a longstanding issue: The Aboriginal Justice Inquiry in Manitoba in 1991 and the Iacobucci Commission in 2013 both strongly recommended a serious look at doing away with peremptory challenges. Those calls to action primarily came with reference to the Crown use of the challenges when an Indigenous person was the accused; the Stanley trial has brought the issue back into focus now, with the defence using the challenges when the Indigenous person is the victim.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/in-saskatchewan-a-high-profile-trials-jury-selection-reveals-a-legal-injustice/\">The legal injustice of peremptory challenges</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>There have also been numerous instances where the justice system has treated Indigenous people with inordinate harshness when they were suspects of crime. J.J. Harper was shot to death in 1988 by a Winnipeg police officer, and it became clear that the officer approached him for no other reason other than that Harper was Indigenous. Donald Marshall was wrongfully convicted for a 1971 murder when the investigating police officers, the Crown prosecutors, and even his own defence lawyers failed to act on information they knew of that spoke of a different perpetrator. Indigenous people are subject to a disproportionate police surveillance, a manifestation of racial profiling that assumes a link between ethnicity and crime. There have also been instances of &#8220;starlight tours,&#8221; a practice by which police officers abandon an Indigenous person outside city limits in freezing temperatures with inadequate clothing to protect against exposure.</p>\n<p>And Indigenous over-incarceration continues unabated. Indigenous people make up 20 per cent of the federal penitentiary population, and as much as 70 to 80 per cent of the jail population in some provinces, despite representing only 3 per cent of the Canadian population. It is not hard to see that Indigenous peoples receive inordinate attention from the justice system as suspects of crime.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/canadas-prisons-are-the-new-residential-schools/\">Canada&#8217;s prisons are the new residential schools</a>\u00a0</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>But when Indigenous people are the victims of crime, it only exacerbates the impression of unfairness. The murder of Helen Betty Osborne by four young white men near The Pas in Manitoba went unsolved for at least 15 years, in part because of a defective police investigation, and in part because, despite knowing the suspects, multiple residents of The Pas did not place enough value on the life of an Indigenous woman to report what they knew to the police. <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.ca/sites/amnesty/files/amr200032004enstolensisters.pdf\">Amnesty International&#8217;s Stolen Sisters report</a>\u00a0examined numerous cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women, and it condemned police officers in many of those cases for not taking allegations of missing Indigenous women seriously, and for conducting investigations with a lack of diligence in comparison to cases involving non-Indigenous victims. John Martin Crawford was a serial killer who preyed on Indigenous women exclusively because he estimated that police racism would improve his chances of going undetected. And there can be problems even when matters come to trial: Pamela George was murdered by two white men, and the judge instructed the all-white jury that they could consider the fact that George was working as a prostitute when deciding whether George had consented to sexual activity with the two accused. A not-guilty verdict followed.</p>\n<p>Such a history has certainly given rise to a perception that when it is an Indigenous person who is a crime victim, the justice system will not take it as seriously as in cases of non-Indigenous victims. All that has led up to the Stanley trial now becoming an intense lightning rod for the feelings of resentment by Indigenous peoples towards the justice system.</p>\n<p>Now to be fair, there are people in the justice system who are sincere in trying to do right by Indigenous peoples. The Osborne murder was not solved until an RCMP officer, Robert Urbanoski, performed a dedicated review of the case 12 years after the fact. Raymond Cormier is now on trial for the murder of Tina Fontaine precisely because the Winnipeg Police Service conducted a diligent and thorough investigation after she was found dead. I certainly do not mean to paint everyone with a negative brush.</p>\n<p>But for many Indigenous peoples, these good stories will seem too happenstance and infrequent to allay their beliefs that the justice system remains fundamentally racist. If the routine operation of the system as it is now is inadequate, the natural question is: do we need concrete legal reforms to address the concerns? For example, do we need to abolish peremptory challenges?\u00a0The question of making juries representative of various segments of the community is a complicated one. Such a reform may inject a measure of fairness into the process, but many people would not want to serve on juries as it is, since it takes them away from their usual employment and can amount to a real hardship. Many Indigenous people live in rural settings, where having to travel to urban centres for jury service can become an especially pronounced hardship. Without addressing those issues first, it&#8217;s unclear if it&#8217;s workable.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/why-gladue-has-not-lived-up-to-its-promise-for-indigenous-justice/\">Why Gladue has not lived up to its promise for Indigenous justice</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Do we need to lift the veil of secrecy on jury deliberations, recognizing that jury nullification can amount to a grave injustice?\u00a0Does exposing jury deliberations to appellate review avoid unjust verdicts based on sympathy or prejudice, or does removing that safe space of secrecy instead compromise the integrity of jury deliberations by forcing jurors to worry about popular condemnation? These are complex questions for which there are no easy answers\u2014but they need to be explored.</p>\n<p>But let us take it further.\u00a0Why limit ourselves to reforming the Canadian justice system itself?\u00a0Could Indigenous peoples having their own criminal justice systems be the answer? Is that the only hope for any kind of fair treatment for Indigenous peoples, whether as accused or as victims?\u00a0There may be some benefits to be realized, although they are not a given. Perhaps self-determination means that the question of an Indigenous person&#8217;s guilt or innocence will be determined by that person&#8217;s Indigenous peers from the same community in which he or she resides. Perhaps Indigenous processes can be utilized in ways that mainstream Canadians may be unfamiliar with. Perhaps witness testimony could be structured in less adversarial ways that are more conducive to ascertaining the truth when they emphasize establishing a rapport with the Indigenous witness, making that witness feel as comfortable as possible, and not exposing the witness to confrontational procedures like cross-examination that can put the witness ill at ease.</p>\n<p>Indigenous self-determination over criminal justice remains a hope, but we are far from that point.\u00a0Unless we get there, the Canadian justice system will continue to insist on asserting its laws and operations over Indigenous peoples. And yet there remains a fundamental problem with that ongoing insistence. Will the Canadian justice system continue to exercise a hyper-vigilant harshness in its treatment of Indigenous people when they are suspects of crime, and at the same time display apathy and laxity toward Indigenous people when they are victims of crime?</p>\n<p>In a Feb. 14 address to Parliament, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stressed the need for the Canadian justice system to do better by Indigenous peoples, promising &#8220;broad-based, concrete reforms to the criminal justice system, including changes to how juries are selected.&#8221; Federal Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, who is herself\u00a0Indigenous, has also signalled intentions to reform the jury system. Whether this dialogue leads to tangible reforms, and what they will look like, is at this point too early to tell. But if the Canadian justice system\u00a0hopes\u00a0to garner any meaningful support from\u00a0Indigenous peoples, then the reforms made within that system have to adequately\u00a0address the discriminatory effects suffered by\u00a0Indigenous peoples\u2014and such reforms would have to be pretty substantial indeed. If the Canadian justice system cannot deliver that redress, then it cannot hope to enjoy any legitimacy in the eyes of Indigenous peoples. The only alternative left, then, becomes full Indigenous self-determination over criminal justice.</p>\n<h3>MORE ABOUT <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/colten-boushie/\">COLTEN BOUSHIE</a>:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/what-political-leaders-said-about-the-gerald-stanley-verdict/\">What political leaders said about the Gerald Stanley verdict</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-colten-boushie-case-and-a-possible-quick-fix-for-the-legal-system/\">The Colten Boushie case and a possible \u2018quick fix\u2019 for the legal system</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/gerald-stanley-trial-aftermath-how-to-avoid-appointing-all-white-juries/\">Gerald Stanley trial aftermath: How to avoid appointing all-white juries</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/canadas-long-road-to-the-colten-boushie-verdict/\">Canada\u2019s long road to the Colten Boushie verdict</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/the-gerald-stanley-verdict-is-a-blow-to-reconciliation-and-a-terrifying-one-at-that/\">The Gerald Stanley verdict is a blow to reconciliation\u2014and a terrifying one at that</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/no-rural-prairie-dwellers-you-cant-shoot-to-protect-your-property/\">No, rural Prairie dwellers, you can\u2019t shoot to protect your property</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/in-saskatchewan-a-high-profile-trials-jury-selection-reveals-a-legal-injustice/\">In Saskatchewan, a trial\u2019s jury selection reveals a legal injustice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/the-tragedy-of-colten-boushie-racism-canada/\">What the tragedy of Colten Boushie says about racism in Canada</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/what-could-reform-look-like-after-the-fury-over-the-stanley-acquittal/\">What could reform look like, after the fury over the Stanley acquittal?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/what-could-reform-look-like-after-the-fury-over-the-stanley-acquittal/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>5</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>&#8216;Numerous fatalities&#8217; in Florida school attack; shooter former student</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/numerous-fatalities-in-florida-high-school-shooting-shooter-in-custody/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/numerous-fatalities-in-florida-high-school-shooting-shooter-in-custody/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2018 21:36:05 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[The Associated Press]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[World]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Florida]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[school shooting]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1100341</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>18-year-old gunman was detained without incident</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/numerous-fatalities-in-florida-high-school-shooting-shooter-in-custody/\">&#8216;Numerous fatalities&#8217; in Florida school attack; shooter former student</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_1100425\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1100425\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FLORIDA_SHOOTING_2_POST.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"822\" height=\"462\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FLORIDA_SHOOTING_2_POST.jpg 822w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FLORIDA_SHOOTING_2_POST-300x168.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FLORIDA_SHOOTING_2_POST-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FLORIDA_SHOOTING_2_POST-600x336.jpg 600w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FLORIDA_SHOOTING_2_POST-375x211.jpg 375w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FLORIDA_SHOOTING_2_POST-111x63.jpg 111w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Parents wait for news after a reports of a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Wednesday, Feb. 14, 2018. (AP Photo/Joel Auerbach)</p></div>\n<p>PARKLAND, Fla. \u2014 A former student opened fire at a Florida high school Wednesday, killing &#8220;numerous&#8221; people, sending students running out into the streets and SWAT team members swarming in before authorities took him into custody.</p>\n<p>Frantic parents rushed to the scene and ambulances converged in front of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Live footage showed emergency workers appearing to treat possibly wounded people on the sidewalks.</p>\n<p>The Broward County Sheriff&#8217;s Office tweeted Wednesday afternoon that &#8220;so far we have at least 14 victims.&#8221; The tweet added: &#8220;Victims have been and continue to be transported to Broward Health Medical Center and Broward Health North hospital.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Broward County Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie said there were &#8220;numerous fatalities.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is a horrific situation.&#8221; He added, &#8220;It is a horrible day for us.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The male shooter was identified as Nicolas Cruz, said a U.S. official briefed on the investigation. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the information publicly. Previously, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel had said the shooter was a former student. He said the shooter was outside and inside the school at points during the attack, and taken into custody &#8220;without incident&#8221; about an hour after he left the school. Israel said police were waiting for the SWAT team to give them the all-clear so that they could go inside the school.</p>\n<p>Michael Nembhard said he was sitting in his garage about a mile away from the school watching the coverage on TV when he heard a police officer yelling, &#8220;Get on the ground, get on the ground, get on the ground!&#8221; He looked up and about 150 yards (140 metres) away he saw a teenage boy on the ground and an officer pointing a gun at him. The officer stood over the boy until other officers arrived, and the boy was handcuffed behind his back and taken away, Nembhard said.</p>\n<p>Noah Parness, a 17-year-old junior, said the fire alarm went off for the second time of the day about 2:30 p.m. He said he and the other students calmly went outside to their fire drill areas when he suddenly heard several pops.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Everyone was kind of just standing there calm, and then we saw a bunch of teachers running down the stairway, and then everybody shifted and broke into a sprint,&#8221; Parness said. &#8220;I hopped a fence.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Television footage showed police in olive fatigues, with weapons drawn, entering the school, then dozens of children frantically running and walking quickly out. A police officer waved the students on, urging them to quickly evacuate. Some students exited the building in single-file rows with hands raised overhead to show they carried no weapons. Others held onto other students as they made their way out past helmeted police in camouflage with weapons drawn.</p>\n<p>The Broward Schools department said on its website that students and staff heard what sounded like gunfire and the school immediately went on lockdown.</p>\n<p>Beth Feingold said her daughter, Brittani, sent a text at 2:32 p.m. that said, &#8220;We&#8217;re on code red. I&#8217;m fine,&#8221; but sent another text shortly afterward saying, &#8220;Mom, I&#8217;m so scared.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Brittani later was able to escape the school, but was running along a busy road for part of the time, in what was a very chaotic scene around school \u2014 one of the state&#8217;s largest in the county with about 3,000 students.</p>\n<p>Feingold said her daughter struggled with anxiety so she knew that she needed to stay calm. She told her daughter in a phone conversation when she was still inside a school building that a Swat team was there to protect her. She said she told her: &#8220;Your dad is on one side of the building, and I&#8217;m on the other.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Feingold said there had been a fire drill in the morning. Then in fourth period, someone pulled the fire alarm again and shouted code red.</p>\n<p>The high school is a sprawling complex set on a tract in the South Florida community of Parkland, about 45 miles (70 kilometres) north of downtown Miami.</p>\n<p>The school had just over 3,100 students in the 2016-2017 academic year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Major streets run along two sides and an expressway passes nearby on the other not far from a residential neighbourhood of single-family homes.</p>\n<p>Caesar Figueroa said when he got to the school to check on his 16-year-old daughter, he saw police officers drawing machine-guns as they approached the campus.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My wife called me that there was an active shooter and the school was on lockdown. I got on the road and saw helicopters. &#8230; It was crazy and my daughter wasn&#8217;t answering her phone.&#8221; She finally texted him that she was inside a closet with friends.</p>\n<p>Len Murray&#8217;s 17-year-old son, a junior at the school, sent his parents a chilling text around 2:30pm: &#8220;Mom and Dad, there have been shots fired on campus at school. There are police sirens outside. I&#8217;m in the auditorium and the doors are locked.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, he texted again: &#8220;I&#8217;m fine.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Murray said he raced to the school only to be stopped by authorities under a highway overpass within view of the school buildings. He said he told his son to save his battery and stop texting, while the boy&#8217;s mother told him to turn off his ringer.</p>\n<p>No information has been provided yet to parents, he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m scared for the other parents here. You can see the concern in everybody&#8217;s faces.

Phillip)</p></div>\n<p>April Meservy\u2019s name started to climb the iTunes music charts as soon Canadian figure skaters Meagan Duhamel and Eric Radford got off the ice.</p>\n<p>The Olympic medal favourites from Team Canada had just finished their first pair&#8217;s routine in Pyeongchang, a nearly flawless skate as they danced to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql3bI39ue9Y\">her cover</a> of the hit U2 song \u201cWith or Without You.\u201d Meservy was even there to see it all, thanks to an anonymous donor who bought her a ticket to Pyeongchang so she could watch the Canadians skate to her song.</p>\n<p>It was a feel-good story unlike any from previous Olympics, in part because this is the first Games where singles and pairs figure skaters are allowed to perform to music that includes lyrics (in ice dancing, music with lyrics has been permitted since the 1990s). The reason: figure skating needs new fans.</p>\n<p>Since the 1990s heyday of the sport\u2019s popularity, when the all-American drama of Tonya Harding versus Nancy Kerrigan was playing out on the ice\u2014as opposed to a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yrucwaxCcI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">movie theatre\u00a0in 2017</a>\u2014figure skating has struggled to keep up its popularity, especially among the all important U.S. audience.</p>\n<p>Fewer than half as many Americans tuned in to watch figure skating for the 2014 Sochi Games as they did for the Harding-Kerrigan smackdown at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer. In those two decades, the sport lost some star power, not to mention fans in the aftermath of the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City, which were so plagued by judging controversies the sport completely <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/olympics/pyeongchang-2018-how-can-patrick-chan-fall-and-still-finish-first/\">revised how it scores routines</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>RELATED:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/olympics/pyeongchang-2018-how-can-patrick-chan-fall-and-still-finish-first/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pyeongchang 2018: How can Patrick Chan fall and still finish first?</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The International Skating Union started its experiment with musical lyrics months after Sochi finished in hopes of helping the sport rebound from its waning popularity, most notably among younger viewers. For the history books, the very first song with lyrics blasting over the loudspeaker at a major competition, back in October 2014, was Canadian Michael Bubl\u00e9 and his rendition of \u201cCry Me a River,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/international/ct-music-lyrics-figure-skating-spt-1024-20141023-column.html\">a choice by Russian skater Artur Gachinski</a>. Since then, the world\u2019s best figure skaters have danced on ice to the music of Justin Bieber, Christina Aguilera and\u2014yes\u2014<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5Tb5upUttA\">rapper Eminem</a>.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, the right song choice can bring a level of energy the music of Swan Lake can&#8217;t.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PV8XZe7iVqc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Fast forward to Pyeongchang, and the song selection is sometimes prophetic. Canada\u2019s Patrick Chan, having never won Olympic gold at previous Games despite being a three-time world champion, fell to the ice multiple times in his first skate in Korea. It was very disappointing short routine in the team event for what is likely his last Games, and his song choice? \u201cDust in the Wind.\u201d</p>\n<p>However, days later for his free skate routine, Chan landed two quads to help launch Canada\u2014and himself\u2014to a gold medal. Perhaps it only fitting that his song choice that day was a cover of Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201cHallelujah.\u201d</p>\n<p>As with any sport with decades of history, there is no shortage of critics, who argue the new playlists serve as a\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/international/ct-music-lyrics-figure-skating-spt-1024-20141023-column.html\">crutch for skaters</a>\u00a0relying hit songs to get the crowd going to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/sports/olympics/figure-skating-lyrics.html\">song choice simply detracting</a> from the main event: the skating itself.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>RELATED:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/olympics/the-north-korean-figure-skaters-have-a-canadian-connection/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The North Korean figure skaters have a Canadian connection</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Then there are the language barriers at international events. What good is a South Korean skater trying to playfully sync up a dance routine with lyrics in a K-Pop song if most of the judges don\u2019t speak Korean?</p>\n<p>Since the musical changes have been adopted, however, figure skating has seen its popularity\u2014at least in America\u2014climb back. The U.S. Figure Skating organization has said its membership has grown steadily over each of the past four years, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/13/news/figure-skating-popularity-us-olympics-pyeongchang/index.html\">according to CNN</a>, and viewership for 2018 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in January was 60 per cent higher than the year prior.</p>\n<p>Thus far in Pyeongchang, music has been a constant driver of conversation among figure skating viewers\u2014from the North Korean pairs team skating to an instrumental cover to the Beatles\u2019 \u201cA Day in the Life\u201d to <em>Sport Illustrated </em><a href=\"https://www.si.com/olympics/2018/02/13/winter-olympics-figure-skating-songs-pyeongchang-2018\">awarding \u201cmedals\u201d</a> for the best skating musical choices.</p>\n<p>As for Meservy, before the Olympics she was unknown indie singer from Utah. Then, without warning, she was getting her 15 minutes of fame and international media attention. Kind of like an Olympian.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/olympics/pyeongchang-2018-pop-songs-with-words-are-good-for-figure-skating/\">Pyeongchang 2018: Pop songs with words are good for figure skating</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/olympics/pyeongchang-2018-pop-songs-with-words-are-good-for-figure-skating/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The Liberal Party insider who saved the TPP trade deal</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-liberal-party-insider-who-saved-the-tpp-trade-deal/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-liberal-party-insider-who-saved-the-tpp-trade-deal/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2018 20:21:11 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Maclean's]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[APEC]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ian McKay]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Japan]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Justin Trudeau]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Shinzo Abe]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[TPP]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[trade]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1100255</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>After Trudeau's no show at a leaders' meeting in Vietnam, the trade deal seemed at risk.

(LILLIAN SUWANRUMPHA/AFP/Getty Images)</p></div>\n<p>Talk to anyone in the Liberal government connected to the international trade file and they won\u2019t hide the fact that Danang was a mess.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 10, with the leaders and trade ministers of 10 countries gathered in a room in Vietnam on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, ready to announce a Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement in principle, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau suddenly went missing.</p>\n<p>Though it would later emerge that Trudeau\u2019s government wasn\u2019t satisfied at that point with the agreement\u2019s outcome for Canada\u2019s auto sector and cultural industries, a picture of Trudeau\u2019s empty seat at that meeting left a mark and soured Canada\u2019s relationships with key allies.</p>\n<p>No TPP member was more irritated than Japan, which became the biggest champion of the agreement following the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal in Jan. 2017. Its former ambassador to Canada told the <em>National Post</em> what happened in Vietnam might lead to \u201cstasis\u201d in the bilateral relationship.</p>\n<p>Fences needed mending\u2014and quick.</p>\n<p>When to the surprise of many International Trade Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Phillipe Champagne announced in Toronto on Jan. 23 that Canada was now prepared to sign the rebranded Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, he expressed his gratitude to one person in particular: Ian McKay.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/three-lessons-from-tpp-that-could-help-canada-in-the-nafta-talks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Three lessons from TPP that could help Canada in the NAFTA talks</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>A number of stakeholders regularly briefed on the status of the talks, including members of influential business associations, were caught off guard. Ian <em>who</em>? They didn\u2019t know the name, let alone that he was involved.</p>\n<p>To Liberals, however, McKay wouldn\u2019t have needed an introduction. National director of the federal party from 2010 to 2013, he was at the helm for the party\u2019s 2013 leadership race and got to know the then small Liberal caucus, including Justin Trudeau, quite well.</p>\n<p>Back in 2000, McKay ran for the Liberals unsuccessfully in Vancouver, then went on to serve as a senior policy advisor to the minister of industry under Jean Chr\u00e9tien and Paul Martin\u2019s governments.</p>\n<p>\u201cCanada successfully concluded an agreement with hard-fought gains for Canadians, thanks in large part to a dedicated and hard-working negotiating team and Canada\u2019s special envoy Ian McKay,\u201d read Champagne\u2019s official statement last month.</p>\n<p>In contrast, when the Liberals named former trade minister Pierre Pettigrew as a special envoy to the European Union in August 2016\u2014to help them get the Canada-EU trade agreement done\u2014there was a press release and very public government acknowledgement of his role. That quickly led to scrutiny of Pettigrew\u2019s position.</p>\n<p>Within days, the Conservatives asked the ethics commissioner to investigate whether Pettigrew\u2019s business affiliations presented a conflict of interest. (The commissioner\u2019s office promptly replied that Pettigrew was not a reporting public office holder and therefore not subject to the Conflict of Interest Act.)</p>\n<p>For McKay, that kind of scrutiny wasn\u2019t possible. His role as TPP envoy wasn\u2019t public knowledge until after his work had finished. As senior Liberal officials would explain, things had just moved too quickly. In their view, Pettigrew\u2019s appointment had been a success and a precedent on which to draw, but it was fundamentally different. For one thing, it was longer, and involved many more countries; McKay had one target: Japan. And his appointment lasted all of about a week.</p>\n<p>On the record, the Prime Minister\u2019s Office provided some general information about the role McKay\u2014now CEO of the Vancouver Economic Commission\u2014played. (McKay declined to comment.) Cameron Ahmad, Trudeau\u2019s deputy communications director, said McKay was appointed on a volunteer basis on Jan. 16 and arrived in Tokyo two days later.</p>\n<p>His expenses were covered and he worked closely with Canadian chief TPP negotiator, Bruce Christie, Ahmad added in an email. He operated at the \u201cpolitical level\u201d\u2014meeting several times with the Japanese TPP minister\u2014but not actually sitting at the negotiating table.</p>\n<p>All of that was \u201ccoordinated with Ottawa, our embassy in Japan and with PMO,\u201d Ahmad wrote.</p>\n<p>But another senior government official, who couldn\u2019t be quoted, went into detail about how McKay, a fluent Japanese speaker, helped make peace with the Japanese and get the agreement passed the finish line.</p>\n<p>When the problematic photo of Trudeau\u2019s absence from the Danang meeting was taken, Trudeau was actually meeting with Japanese Prime Minster Shinzo Abe and telling him that Canada wasn\u2019t prepared to sign yet, said the official.\u00a0Abe, disappointed, told Trudeau that the group meeting about to take place probably wasn\u2019t necessary, and so Trudeau decided not to take part.</p>\n<p>Abe and Trudeau had had a very good relationship to that point, the official said, and no one felt great about how things were left in Danang.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to London, Ont., where the Liberal cabinet was meeting on Jan. 11 and 12 ahead of meetings of chief TPP negotiators in Tokyo scheduled for the end of the month. McKay, who\u2019d worked in finance in Japan for over a decade and now runs a group that tries to lure foreign direct investment to Vancouver, was invited to facilitate a conversation with cabinet about Japan and TPP.</p>\n<p>Protocol and optics dictated that Canada couldn\u2019t send a minister to the Japan TPP talks, because it wasn\u2019t a ministerial round, but McKay\u2019s input in London gave Trudeau the idea of sending him as an envoy to Japan to reboot the relationship and better explain Canada\u2019s positions, the official said.</p>\n<p>Days later, McKay was on a plane to Tokyo with the assignment of making a connection at the political level. Jonathan Fried, Canada\u2019s former ambassador to Japan and current personal representative to the prime minister on the G20, joined him.</p>\n<p>At a Vancouver foreign ministers meeting on North Korea, while McKay was en route to Tokyo, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland made sure her Japanese counterpart knew McKay would be speaking for the government; Trudeau\u2019s right-hand man, Gerry Butts, told the Japanese ambassador the same in Ottawa.</p>\n<p>On Jan. 18, McKay and Japanese TPP Minister Toshimitsu Motegi spoke for over two hours, almost entirely in Japanese, according to the senior official, and hit it off. At the end of the meeting, Motegi invited McKay to dinner, where they spoke for two more hours.</p>\n<p>They were making progress, the official said. McKay had explained why Canada needed to protect its cultural sector in TPP; that it needed improved market access for Canadian auto exports in Japan; and that it could make no further supply management concessions.</p>\n<p>Nothing was agreed to as chief negotiators started to meet on Jan. 23, but by the end of the day progress had been made on autos: the Japanese agreed to automatically grant Canada any future concessions made to other trading partners and to a binding resolution process on non-tariff barriers.</p>\n<p>On Monday, Montegi and McKay met again to have one more conversation.

(Colin Way/Sportsnet)</p></div>\n<p>Kaillie Humphries is sitting in a downtown convention centre in her hometown of Calgary, about 60 km east of where she tore down a bobsleigh track for the first time, and she\u2019s on the topic of her chief rival, an American named Elana Meyers Taylor. \u201cI know, I know,\u201d the two-time Olympic gold medallist says, smiling and throwing up her tattooed arms, \u201cI could pick a different friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>She really could. On the bobsleigh circuit, Humphries has dominated for the better part of a decade, there are dozens of elite athletes the 32-year-old could choose to call her closest buddy. There are plenty of fellow Canadians, to be sure. And yet, she\u2019s grown closest to the woman who has the best chance at dethroning her as Olympic champion.</p>\n<p>Over the past five years, no one has challenged Humphries like Meyers Taylor, the 33-year-old California-born and Georgia-raised pilot. In a sport that requires perfection, where consistency is tough to attain and smidgeons of a second matter a ton, these two are regularly 1-2. Humphries was first at the Sochi Olympics, Meyers Taylor was second. Meyers Taylor was first at the last world championships, Humphries was second. The rivalry is so deeply rooted that Meyers Taylor says, \u201cthere\u2019s really no way to classify it, because we rival each other in every sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>And yet, if Meyers Taylor doesn\u2019t win, \u201cI want Kaillie to,\u201d she says. If the Canadian doesn\u2019t win, well, \u201cI want Elana to,\u201d Humphries says.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/olympics/pyeongchang-2018-how-olympic-athletes-deal-with-failure/\">Pyeongchang 2018: How Olympic athletes deal with failure</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The two became friends on account of a devil-you-know situation: Humphries trains with Meyers Taylor in order to push herself so she can beat Meyers Taylor when it really counts. Meyers Taylor, of course, has the same game plan. In the process of working out together they became fast friends \u2014 \u201cshe\u2019s very likeable,\u201d Humphries admits \u2014 because they have everything in common, nationality aside. No one else feels the pressure they do to win, in Humphries\u2019s case because that\u2019s what she does at the Olympics, in Meyers Taylor\u2019s because she let gold slip away four years ago. And if you ask Humphries, nobody works quite as hard as they do. \u201cI could be friends with shittier people,\u201d she says, \u201cbut they\u2019re shittier for a reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well said.</p>\n<p>And so, the woman who\u2019s looking to become the first to ever pilot back-to-back-to-back sleds to Olympic gold is going to remain close with the American who could beat her in Pyeongchang, her friend Elana, the training partner whose ass she wants to kick. Because, as Humphries admits, \u201cI need her.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1100265\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1100265\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Big-Read-Kaille-Humphries-at-sochi.jpg\" alt=\"Team Canada bobsled\" width=\"822\" height=\"462\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Big-Read-Kaille-Humphries-at-sochi.jpg 822w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Big-Read-Kaille-Humphries-at-sochi-300x168.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Big-Read-Kaille-Humphries-at-sochi-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Big-Read-Kaille-Humphries-at-sochi-600x336.jpg 600w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Big-Read-Kaille-Humphries-at-sochi-375x211.jpg 375w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Big-Read-Kaille-Humphries-at-sochi-111x63.jpg 111w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">In Pyeongchang, Humphries is looking to become the first to pilot back-to-back-to-back sleds to Olympic gold. (Sampics/Corbis/Getty)</p></div>\n<p>That devil-you-know situation? Blame a UK-born sprinting coach. Stu McMillan is his name, and he has coached skeleton, bobsleigh and track-and-field athletes from Canada, the U.S. and Great Britain to more than 30 Olympic medals (among his current clients is sprinting phenom, Andre De Grasse). McMillian is the best bobsleigh push coach in the world, \u201cand there\u2019s no argument,\u201d Meyers Taylor says. The coach will tell you that\u2019s because he\u2019s one of just five or so people on the planet with that job description, but still, four years ago at the Sochi Olympics, McMillan coached at least one athlete in each of the women\u2019s medal-winning sleds. \u201cWhy would you go with anyone else?\u201d Meyers Taylor asks.</p>\n<p>It was McMillan who trained Meyers Taylor in the lead-up to her bronze-medal performance at her Olympic debut in Vancouver in 2010, while she was a brakeman. Meyers Taylor switched to pilot soon after and tried some other coaches, but ahead of the 2012\u201313 season she asked McMillan if she could join the Calgary-based training group he\u2019d assembled. He was happy to oblige, of course, but he told Meyers Taylor she\u2019d have to clear it with Humphries first. \u201cThe group dynamic when people are training together is very, very important,\u201d McMillan explains.</p>\n<p>Humphries had the reaction you\u2019d expect when Meyers Taylor first floated the idea at a world cup stop in Switzerland: \u201cI wanted to say no,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was no way I wanted to share with her.\u201d Humphries is McMillan\u2019s longest-running client, and they\u2019re now in their 11th year together. Eventually, after speaking with McMillan and thinking it over, Humphries became convinced it was actually a good idea. \u201cMaybe she didn\u2019t know it then,\u201d McMillan says, \u201cbut she needed somebody at that level to train with to give her a little bit of additional motivation.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/olympics/the-north-korean-figure-skaters-have-a-canadian-connection/\">The North Korean figure skaters have a Canadian connection</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>And it turned out Meyers Taylor pushed her more than a little bit. \u201cThere was nobody within our Canadian system and nobody in the world that was going to push me athletically or mentally more than Elana,\u201d Humphries says. \u201cIf I was going to continue after Vancouver to be dominant, to continue to defend gold, I couldn\u2019t become complacent \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t be the athlete I am today without Elana pushing me as hard as she does.\u201d</p>\n<p>Humphries will be first to admit, though, that it can be incredibly frustrating training side-by-side with her rival. Meyers Taylor is, after all, an athletic specimen. She\u2019s not tall, at five-foot-five, but she\u00a0is\u00a0180 pounds of mostly muscle. As the American puts it, \u201cI\u2019ve got some genetic gifts,\u201d thanks to her dad, Eddie, who played in the NFL. \u201cI\u2019m freakishly good at squatting,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Those gifts mean Humphries is rarely the strongest in their training sessions in the gym. \u201cI see on a daily basis that I\u2019m not the best,\u201d Humphries explains. \u201cShe reminds me that on any given day I can be No. 2 or No. 3. I have to fight for that No. 1 position.\u201d As Meyers Taylor points out, \u201cIf I\u2019ve gotta squat 180 kilos [397 pounds] to out-push her on the track by a little bit, then I\u2019m gonna do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>If you ask Humphries, she\u2019s the best pilot in the world, but Meyers Taylor is \u201cby far\u201d the fastest starter. Meyers Taylor holds the start record \u2014 the time it takes from the moment a team begins pushing the sled to the moment both sliders have jumped in and are seated \u2014 at a couple of tracks, but she says that Humphries is closer than the Canadian thinks. \u201cI feel like Kaillie could sit on the couch for two weeks and be just as good at pushing,\u201d Meyers Taylor says. \u201cShe\u2019s figured out how to push a sled, and it\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen. She\u2019s so efficient; she\u2019s so natural.\u201d</p>\n<p>Meyers Taylor has had the upper hand with her push times this season in a few races and won\u2019t hesitate to let her training partner know it. \u201cI trash talk all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether or not she likes it, but she entertains me at least.\u201d The two don\u2019t talk on race day, but in the lead-up, you might hear Meyers Taylor say something like, \u201cI\u2019m coming for you!\u201d Humphries has her retort down: \u201cHistory will prove that\u2019s not gonna make a difference.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/olympics/pyeongchang-2018-patrick-chan-proves-he-can-deliver-under-pressure/\">Pyeongchang 2018: Patrick Chan proves he can deliver under pressure</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s all part of the friendship, of course. Ask either pilot what she likes most about the other and the word \u201ccompetitive\u201d comes up pretty quickly. Humphries is in a distinct category in that regard, says McMillan, who\u2019s never seen her drive waver. It\u2019s impressive for any athlete, but especially one who competes in a sport that receives so little mainstream attention. \u201cShe\u2019s got a very clear understanding of what she\u2019s driven by when she gets up every morning, and that\u2019s been consistent for a decade,\u201d McMillan says. \u201cThe athletes who aren\u2019t as successful as Kaillie, they\u2019ll go through periods of their training careers where they lose that drive, that passion, that love for the sport. And she\u2019s really driven by being the best, continuing to go out and prove to everybody that she\u2019s the one to beat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Humphries is the first to admit that fire means she isn\u2019t easy to work with. \u201cI know I\u2019m not,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cI demand a lot from my teammates and my coaches, but it\u2019s nothing that I don\u2019t demand of myself. Am I control freak? One hundred percent. Do I need things to be the very best? One hundred percent. That\u2019s how I\u2019m the best.\u201d</p>\n<p>Four years ago in Sochi, at the Sanki Sliding Centre, it looked like Humphries and brakeman Heather Moyse were going to be second-best. Through three runs, Meyers Taylor and Lauren Williams had a 0.11-second lead on the Canadians, and this after Meyers Taylor had to rebuild parts of her sled after it hit a wall in a training run and \u201cshattered into pieces.\u201d</p>\n<p>But on her fourth and final run, Meyers Taylor made a costly driving error, hit the wall and lost Olympic gold. At the bottom of the track, Humphries and Moyse \u2014 who\u2019d already finished their final run \u2014 watched USA 1 cross the line with a cumulative time 0.10 seconds slower than theirs. The Canadians jumped up and down, hugging and screaming in celebration.</p>\n<p>Humphries and Meyers Taylor didn\u2019t see one another until they were on the podium, and it wasn\u2019t until all the athletes had received their medals and the Canadians had belted out the anthem that the rivals hugged. When they talked later, it wasn\u2019t about the result. \u201cI knew she was gutted,\u201d Humphries says. \u201cShe feels like she lost the gold and didn\u2019t win the silver.\u201d Meyers Taylor left Sochi before the closing ceremony. \u201cI needed to get out of there, with everything that happened, my sled breaking and not being too happy with my performance,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt it was best for me to leave.\u201d Her friend, meanwhile, carried Canada\u2019s flag in the closing ceremony, and celebrated becoming the first female pilot to successfully defend an Olympic title.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/olympics/pyeonchang-2018-these-are-canadas-medallists/\">Pyeonchang 2018: These are Canada\u2019s medallists</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The outcome of that race has been driving Meyers Taylor for the past four years. Since her silver-medal finish, she has piloted USA 1 to two world championships, including last year in Germany, where Humphries ended up on the second-highest podium step. \u201cWhen you come that close to that Olympic gold medal, you can\u2019t help but use that to push you forward,\u201d Meyers Taylor says.</p>\n<p>Pyeongchang, then, offers a chance at redemption for Meyers Taylor, and an opportunity to make history, yet again, for Humphries. The Canadian says the target on her back feels enormous. \u201cThis will be a three-peat,\u201d Humphries says. \u201cIs that what I\u2019m working towards? Definitely. At the same point, I don\u2019t devalue my competitors, I know it\u2019s going to be a hard-fought battle. They\u2019re going to step up because they want their first Olympic gold-medal experience, and I don\u2019t want to give it to them. It will be a challenge, but one I\u2019m ready for, one I\u2019ve worked for, and one I will do everything to attain again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Meyers Taylor can\u2019t wait for a second chance to pilot Team USA to Olympic gold, for another shot at beating her friend on the biggest stage. But she wants to make one thing clear: \u201cI don\u2019t want to beat her because she did something wrong,\u201d Meyers Taylor says. \u201cI want to beat her when she\u2019s at the top of her game.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her training partner couldn\u2019t agree more. \u201cWe call it the \u2018Battle Royale,\u2019\u201d Humphries says. \u201cMay the best person win.\u201d</p>\n<p>This article

attends a photocall during the Edinburgh International Book Festival on August 21, 2017 in Edinburgh, Scotland. (Simone Padovani/Awakening/Getty Images)</p></div>\n<p>Born in Northern Ireland and raised in Wales and Scotland, Maggie O\u2019Farrell, 45, is the author of seven acclaimed novels and, now, one astonishing memoir, <em>I Am, I Am, I Am: Seventeen Brushes with Death</em>. The exquisitely apt title comes from Sylvia Plath\u2019s novel <em>The Bell Jar</em>: \u201cI took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am. I am. I am.\u201d That\u2019s precisely what O\u2019Farrell is up to in her taut, beautifully written book\u2014celebrating life that goes on after escapes less miraculous than random. A collection of essays following no chronological order and named after the body part most at risk each time\u2014including neck, lungs and cranium, some more than once\u2014<em>I Am</em> sweeps across time and distance. There are terrifying moments in Scotland, Chile and above the Pacific Ocean, and close calls ranging from a childhood bout of encephalitis that left O\u2019Farrell with relatively minor but permanent muscle, nerve and cerebellum damage, to a Caesarean that went so wrong the attending doctors were leaving bloody footprints as they moved about.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/the-modern-baby-boomers-guide-to-dying/\">The modern Baby Boomer\u2019s guide to dying</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The themes, and O\u2019Farrell\u2019s prose, reach a crescendo in the 17th and final chapter, when the focus moves from the writer to her middle child and her life-threatening susceptibility to anaphylactic shock. O\u2019Farrell and her husband, novelist Will Sutcliffe, are out of cell range on Italian back roads when it becomes apparent their daughter\u2014wheezing and clawing at her throat\u2014has somehow come into contact with one of the many substances that can kill her. Suddenly the car comes into range, the satnav snaps into life, the map to the hospital appears. Sutcliffe guns far past the speed limit, the car screeches to a halt at the emergency entrance. O\u2019Farrell runs in, child in her arms, with her own version of John Donne\u2019s \u201cDeath, Be Not Proud\u201d running through her mind: \u201cOh no you don\u2019t. Not now, not here. You\u2019re not getting her, not today, not any time soon. She is, she is, she is.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>There are many themes in your book, including maternal love, but is the main one how thin the membrane is between life and death?</strong></p>\n<p>I wanted to invite people to think about their own near-death experiences. We\u2019ve all had them, some more serious than others, obviously. The book is asking people to think about what it meant to them, those times when they came really close to death, what such experiences make us think about and value or reassess.</p>\n<p><strong>So, you don\u2019t think you\u2019re exceptionally lucky to be alive\u2014or exceptionally unlucky in coming so close to not being alive\u2014because the rest of us have these experiences, too? We just don&#8217;t <em>see</em> them. We suppress our awareness.</strong></p>\n<p>Perhaps I\u2019ve had more than most people, but certainly less than some. There&#8217;s nothing unique about my experiences. We\u2019re all lucky to be alive, aren\u2019t we? From our very conception\u2014one in five pregnancies ends in miscarriage\u2014life is random. And the odds against being our unique selves are what, seven billion to one?</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/death-doulas/\">The rise of the death doula</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>That brings to mind the \u201cCranium\u201d chapter, when you bent over to hold a dog\u2019s collar and the wheel arch of a passing van brushed through your hair. That sort of experience, more than your encounters with violent men in Chile and Scotland\u2014the two \u201cNeck\u201d chapters\u2014would be familiar to many.</strong></p>\n<p>Something like that is a common recollection for people, when a step or two in the wrong direction could have killed them. It makes you more careful the next time, perhaps.</p>\n<p><strong>Perhaps not. There are three \u201cLungs\u201d chapters. You have had your share of trouble in the ocean and you are still not leery of it at all.</strong></p>\n<p>No, no, once I had children I became a lot more careful, really, though it&#8217;s not kept me out of the ocean. But more cautious, really.</p>\n<p><strong>You name as few people as possible. What was your thinking there?</strong></p>\n<p>One of the things that always worried me about writing a memoir was the tax it imposes on friends and family. I love to read memoirs, but sometimes they take your breath away, how exposing they are, not just of the writers but the people around them. The only person who has his real name is my husband, Will. Everybody else, including the children, is unnamed or has a pseudonym.</p>\n<p><strong>What stood out there was Jimmy Savile, the media personality lionized for his charitable work on behalf of sick children. After his death in 2011, his rampant sexual abuse of children, often while they were hospitalized, came out. You didn\u2019t name him when recalling his appearance in your hospital room during your encephalitis recovery.</strong></p>\n<p>That was slightly different. I didn&#8217;t want to name him, type those letters in that order, in a book with my children. It was almost a superstitious thing, like destroying that signed copy of a book Savile gave me, which I came across while writing <em>I Am</em>. I thought if you know who he is, you&#8217;ll recognize him and if you don&#8217;t, it doesn&#8217;t really matter.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/when-last-tweets-become-last-words/\">When last tweets become last words</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Were there other constraints that made you reluctant to craft a memoir? Did you worry about the treachery of memory?</strong></p>\n<p>Some, but after the fear of exposing other people, my other issue was how restrictive I find chronological structure. I&#8217;m not that wedded to chronology in my novels, because I don&#8217;t think that as human beings we are organized in a neat chronological order. It\u2019s not really the way we think. So coming up with the structure of episodic essays, arranged by body part, was liberating. I didn&#8217;t have to stick to a kind of &#8220;and then this happened and then that&#8221; form. Which meant there was an awful lot I could leave out\u2014skip five years, 10 years, and it wouldn&#8217;t look as odd as it would have in chronological order. That meant I could omit things and protect people&#8217;s privacy. It was also much easier to have my siblings or my parents dip in and out in a way that would have been impossible otherwise.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0It was hard, then, to write about your children and your husband in a way not just fair about them but fair to them?</strong></p>\n<p>Silences in the book speak volumes. Like the rests in music, the things that aren&#8217;t said\u2014the submerged narratives\u2014are as important as the ones you say. The chapters that were about my kids and my husband went back and forth a lot between us. Something else that arose in writing was the idea of ownership of narrative. There are stories in there you could say I own because they happened to me, But a lot of them I don&#8217;t own. The final chapter about my daughter I wrote when she was sick. I had to bear in mind the story of her condition is hers to tell if she chooses later in life, not mine. What I could write about was taking care of her, not interpreting what it meant to her. I don&#8217;t own that story. She does.</p>\n<p><strong>The individual stories move about in time, too. You describe a moment\u2014a man holds a machete to your throat or a riptide pulls you under\u2014and weave your present-day thoughts into the past outcome.</strong></p>\n<p>Despite the subtitle, the book is really about life, about one life lived around those moments, and the way I now, at 45, look back on them. I wanted these essays to be like that, to convey the immediacy of what it was like to be five and nearly run over, at the same time as what it&#8217;s like to be 45 thinking about it. I approached the writing as a novelist, because that&#8217;s what I am, and that&#8217;s the way I think about things.</p>\n<p><strong>It was very tricky\u2014and brilliantly pulled off\u2014for you to write about the past that way. There were times you had to flick at the encephalitis you had at age eight, because that was the first Great Divide of your life, a clear before-and-after moment that affected many later events, like why you had to have a Caesarean.</strong></p>\n<p>I realized for the first time with this book how writing memoir is so different. Fiction has its artistic forms\u2014you make a beginning and an end, you choose exactly what to include\u2014while in a memoir you have to create order out of chaos. Life is messy and you don&#8217;t always get the answers to the questions it throws at you. Usually, you don&#8217;t. When I listed the experiences I would include, it was only then that I realized how many related back to my illness as a child. I&#8217;d never really thought the virus had changed me so fundamentally. But of course, it had, I just wasn&#8217;t ready to admit that to myself.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/the-doctor-who-took-on-death/\">The doctor who took on death</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>That does explain a lot. It&#8217;s the awareness of these incidents that alter us, not the incidents themselves. What happened to you, to your brain, when you were eight sparked major developments\u2014a certain recklessness arising from the belief you were on borrowed time anyway, and an awareness of mortal fragility probably more intense than most people\u2019s.</strong></p>\n<p>The doctors set out two different destinies for me. First of all, that I was going to die\u2014I gathered that from what I overheard\u2014and then, when I didn&#8217;t die, that I would never walk again, never hold a pen, always be in a wheelchair. I have always felt I&#8217;ve managed to find a loophole escape out of those two futures. My life has been incredibly blessed. I&#8217;ve tried to make the most of it.</p>\n<p><strong>The \u201cCerebellum\u201d essay, which contains my favourite lines in the book\u2014\u201cWhen you are a child no one tells you that you\u2019re going to die. You have to work it out for yourself\u201d\u2014is the 16th and final chapter about you, capping all your other near misses, and immediately preceding \u201cDaughter.\u201d Between those two falls your second Great Divide: motherhood. That was the impetus to writing the book, thinking about your children? </strong></p>\n<p>Well, I can&#8217;t believe I would have been grappling with ideas of mortality and the fragility of life if I hadn&#8217;t been required as a parent to look after a child with additional needs. For an eight-year-old, she&#8217;s had a lot more brushes with death than most children. It&#8217;s the job of parents to help their children to metabolize whatever difficult experience they&#8217;re going through, and give it back to them in a form they can understand. One week she can be in the ICU and the next week in class back at her times tables. How do I reconcile the two sides of her life, help her understand why she is in pain, why she is suffering, why she\u2019s in an ambulance? All I could do was to tell her stories. It highlighted for me as a mother and as a writer the human need for narrative, our urge to transpose our experiences into a story or to hear the story of other people&#8217;s experiences, because good stories explain us to ourselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Story is the only thing that explains anything.</strong></p>\n<p>Especially to a child who is trying to grapple with enormous questions of pain and mortality. It&#8217;s to help her understand that all of us have challenges. I&#8217;m always saying to her, look at everybody around you\u2014others may not have something as dramatic as anaphylactic shock or as visible as severe eczema, but everybody is struggling with something. The only thing we can all do is to live the biggest and best life we can within the boundaries our challenges set for us.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/death/\">DEATH</a>:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/the-modern-baby-boomers-guide-to-dying/\">The modern Baby Boomer\u2019s guide to dying</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/sports/what-does-it-mean-when-we-mourn-sports-heroes-like-roy-halladay/\">What does it mean when we mourn sports heroes like Roy Halladay?</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/health/a-gender-gap-thats-a-matter-of-life-and-death/\">A gender gap that\u2019s a matter of life and death</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/when-last-tweets-become-last-words/\">When last tweets become last words</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/partisan-to-the-very-end-and-beyond/\">Partisan to the very end\u2014and beyond</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/the-queen-is-not-dead-how-a-prank-bbc-tweet-sparked-alarm/\">The Queen is not dead: How a \u2018prank\u2019 BBC tweet sparked alarm</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/death-doulas/\">The rise of the death doula</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/h-is-for-hawk/\">When grief takes flight: Book review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/how-often-have-you-come-close-to-death/\">How often have you come close to death?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/how-often-have-you-come-close-to-death/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The North Korean figure skaters have a Canadian connection</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/olympics/the-north-korean-figure-skaters-have-a-canadian-connection/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/olympics/the-north-korean-figure-skaters-have-a-canadian-connection/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2018 16:32:44 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Maclean's]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Olympics]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Sports]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[2018 Olympics]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[2018 Winter Olympics]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[North Korea]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Pyeongchang]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Pyeongchang 2018]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Winter Olympics]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Winter Olympics 2018]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1100221</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Ryom Tae Ok and Kim Ju Sik spent last summer in Montreal training with Team Canada coach Bruno Marcotte</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/olympics/the-north-korean-figure-skaters-have-a-canadian-connection/\">The North Korean figure skaters have a Canadian connection</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_1100227\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1100227\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ryom-tae-ok-kim-ju-sik-north-korea-figure-skaters-pyeongchang-olympics-18534341-paul-chiasson-cp_POST.jpeg\" alt=\"Ryom Tae Ok and Kim Ju Sik\" width=\"822\" height=\"541\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ryom-tae-ok-kim-ju-sik-north-korea-figure-skaters-pyeongchang-olympics-18534341-paul-chiasson-cp_POST.jpeg 822w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ryom-tae-ok-kim-ju-sik-north-korea-figure-skaters-pyeongchang-olympics-18534341-paul-chiasson-cp_POST-300x197.jpeg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ryom-tae-ok-kim-ju-sik-north-korea-figure-skaters-pyeongchang-olympics-18534341-paul-chiasson-cp_POST-768x505.jpeg 768w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ryom-tae-ok-kim-ju-sik-north-korea-figure-skaters-pyeongchang-olympics-18534341-paul-chiasson-cp_POST-375x247.jpeg 375w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ryom Tae Ok and Kim Ju Sik of North Korea compete in the pairs figure skating short program at the Pyeonchang Winter Olympics Wednesday, February 14, 2018 in Gangneung, South Korea. (Paul Chiasson/CP)</p></div>\n<p>GANGNEUNG, South Korea \u2013 There is so much intrigue attached to everything North Korean at the Pyeongchang Olympics, so much eagerness to analyze and seek wider meaning from every act by their dignitaries, their cheering squads, and, of course, their athletes. Their presence at the Winter Games is inspiring or cynical or hopeful or painful or symbolic or hollow, depending on your vantage point, and since they\u2019re under watch by severe-looking men in black, it\u2019s impossible to know what they really think.</p>\n<p>In part, that\u2019s why the North Korean figure skating pairs team of Ryom Tae Ok and Kim Ju Sik are so compelling. The country\u2019s 22-athlete delegation is, essentially, inaccessible but Ryom, 19, and Kim, 25, feel different, and not just because they trained in Montreal this past summer and are coached by Canadian Bruno Marcotte.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/how-sports-diplomacy-could-lead-to-an-unprecedented-shift-for-the-koreas/\">How sports diplomacy could lead to an unprecedented shift for the Koreas</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Unlike their compatriots, they actually earned their way to Pyeongchang, securing berths by qualifying in September rather than getting in through an allocation of extra spots. And they\u2019re legit good, sitting a surprising 11th after Wednesday\u2019s short program, with upside for the future.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re more than just a feel-good story.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I will say one statement about them, I\u2019m very happy for them, and they did their job,&#8221; said Marcotte, also the coach of Canadian pair Meagan Duhamel, his wife, and Eric Radford, who sit third after the short. &#8220;That\u2019s it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Marcotte wouldn\u2019t take further questions on Ryom and Kim to avoid creating a distraction for the Canadian team, but he\u2019s been in high demand at these Games because of his work with the North Koreans. They first connected at the world championships in Helsinki last March and eventually the pair came over to Montreal to train under Marcotte with Duhamel and Radford.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Their whole team of people and coaches and their federation, they were all so nice and so generous and so passionate about skating and passionate about competing at the Olympics for their country,&#8221; Duhamel recalled in a recent interview with Sportsnet. &#8220;That\u2019s what the Olympics are about, to be able to participate in the Olympics representing the country you feel proud of. And they feel so proud of their country and they want to represent their country in the Olympics. It was such a great experience to get to know them and train with them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The influence of that experience showed at the Gangneung Ice Arena.</p>\n<p>Ryom and Kim smiled and emoted during an expressive skate that stood in stark contrast to the North Korean cheer squad in the rink\u2019s upper corner, clad in conspicuous red jackets with blue and white trim, which either sat stoically facing forward, avoiding any eye contact, or dutifully chanted and waved flags in unison.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/sports/pyeongchang-2018-will-team-canada-beat-its-medal-record/\">Pyeongchang 2018: Will Team Canada beat its medal record?</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Kim waved to those fans at the end of their performance, and afterwards told the Olympic Information Service in the mixed zone where interviews take place that, &#8220;the cheering from the South Koreans and North Koreans together for us was very helpful.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Asked about their experience at the Games, he added that &#8220;there have been no inconveniences whatsoever when it comes to life here in the South area,&#8221; and that &#8220;we could really feel the power and the energy of the Korean people.&#8221;</p>\n<p>They then blew through the rest of the mixed zone, ignoring an official asking them to stop in front of South Korean and North American media, a handler at their back pushing them through.</p>\n<p>Duhamel said she and Radford saw them after their performance and that Ryom and Kim were both very excited about how it went. She was also pleased by the progress they\u2019ve made since the summer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I worked with them a little bit on the energy of their footwork and their death spiral, so when she starts rolling her head and giving more emotion I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s what I asked her to do,\u2019&#8221; said Duhamel. &#8220;I feel like I take just a little bit of credit for it, obviously not much. They\u2019re so impressive in the fact that they keep coming out and nailing their performances.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/olympics/pyeongchang-2018-how-olympic-athletes-deal-with-failure/\">Pyeongchang 2018: How Olympic athletes deal with failure</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>As for their own short program that left them third at 76.82 points, just 0.23 ahead of Germans Aljona Savchenko and Bruno Massot, Radford said that &#8220;content is a really good word.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It wasn\u2019t crazy perfect, but we\u2019re definitely really satisfied, really happy, we felt right where we wanted to be when the music started,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;We did some good elements, not great, but we can take those little things that were off and give ourselves a target for (Thursday).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Added Duhamel: &#8220;Especially in a field this deep, we could have taken ourselves out of contention with missing a major element. We didn\u2019t do that, we kept ourselves in the mix. That makes us feel good going forward.&#8221;</p>\n<p>China\u2019s Sui Wenjing and Han Cong lead at 82.39 followed by Russians Evgenia Tarasova and Vladimir Morozov at 81.68 going into Thursday\u2019s

kill tank at the old Hallmark Poultry Factory on Clark Drive. He set out on a career in urban regeneration and applied demographics that took him to projects in New Orleans, New York City and San Francisco.</p>\n<p>Nowadays he\u2019s the director of the City Program at Simon Fraser University, and while he\u2019s too modest to boast about it, along the way he\u2019s picked up a couple of exceedingly rare civic distinctions.</p>\n<p>The first is the enduring enmity of all the politicians, real estate speculators, white-collar currency pirates and money launderers who have turned Vancouver into a global swindler\u2019s paradise for real estate racketeering, a city that is now also one of the world\u2019s most hopelessly pathetic urban landscapes of housing affordability. The second thing Yan has earned is an unfettered and unimpeachable right to say \u201cI told you so.\u201d</p>\n<p>Three years ago, Yan was anxious to get a handle on the role foreign capital was playing in Vancouver\u2019s weirdly convulsing real estate market. At the time, Yan\u2019s main gig was his work as an urban planner with Bing Thom Architects, on contract as an urban planner. When\u00a0Yan published the results of his research in November, 2015, it\u00a0came as a shock,\u00a0for two main reasons. It seemed to conclusively prove what everybody knew but nobody was supposed to say out loud. And it broke a taboo that was enforced so absurdly that Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson resorted to dismissing Yan\u2019s research as racist.</p>\n<p>Yan found that buyers with \u201cnon-Anglicised Chinese names\u201d had picked up two-thirds of 172 houses sold over a six-month period beginning in September 2014 in Vancouver\u2019s posh west side neighbourhoods. Contrary to public perception, however, the buyers weren\u2019t just showing up with \u201cbags of cash\u201d to make their buys. Some of Canada\u2019s biggest banks were in on it. Roughly 80 per cent of the deals involved a mortgage, and half of the mortgages were held by two banks \u2013 CIBC and HSBC.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>WATCH: 5 signs Canada is in the grips of real estate mania</strong></p></blockquote>\n\t\t<div class=\"bc-video bc-video-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"player-loader\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n\t\t\t<iframe src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/video/iframe/13639244001/VJjIBwmqg/5389510190001\"\n\t\t\t\twidth=\"640\"\n\t\t\t\theight=\"360\"\n\t\t\t\tallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tmozallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; right: 0px; left: 0px;\" class=\"rdm-brightcove-videojs-iframe\"></iframe>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n<p>Canada\u2019s banks have mastered the manipulation of clandestine back channels around China\u2019s currency control regulations\u2014the same routes that well-connected Chinese multi-millionaires have been using to shift up to a trillion dollars\u2019 worth of yuan out of China every year. What wasn\u2019t clear about what was happening on Vancouver\u2019 s west side, however, was who the real buyers were, exactly. The new homeowners\u2019 most commonly stated occupation: housewife or homemaker.</p>\n<p>Fast forward three years. The weirdness that Yan documented in Point Grey, Dunbar, Kerrisdale and Shaughnessy has rapidly spread southward and eastward, decoupling the bonds linking incomes with housing values across Burnaby, Richmond, Coquitlam, all the way out to Surrey and White Rock on the Canada-U.S. border. Metro Vancouver\u2019s real estate market is now a dystopian tableau of panic buying, tax fraud, property flipping, overseas pre-construction condominium sales, stone cold speculation and elaborate, multiple-account money transfer rigmaroles that are the conduit of choice for drug cartel tycoons. Not even the heaviest regulatory hands at the controls of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s surveillance state seem capable of shutting the networks down.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not just about shady Chinese money\u2014not by a long shot. Vancouver\u2019s old establishment property developers and real-estate companies fed the frenzies and made a killing. Along the way, they greased the skids by pouring buckets of money into Gregor Robertson\u2019s now-dying Vision Vancouver civic party and Christy Clark\u2019s Liberal Party. Robertson is now a sad figure, his legacy a shambles, his term up in October, and even his celebrated relationship with his glamorous girlfriend, the Chinese pop star Wanting Qu, fell apart last year. Qu\u2019s mother, a Communist Party official in Harbin, remains on trial on charges of embezzling $70 million in a land swindle. Christy Clark is history, too. Her government was toppled last year by John Horgan\u2019s New Democrats.\u00a0With at least 60,000 Chinese immigrant investors sloshing their money around Metro Vancouver real estate over the past few years, federal politicians, too\u2014Liberals, mainly\u2014have been more than happy to rake it in at cash-for-access soirees and in generous donations to election campaign war chests.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/worldpolitics/why-canadians-need-to-start-worrying-about-china/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Why Canadians need to start worrying about China</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>In these ways, in Vancouver&#8217;s political circles, and in polite company, one simply didn\u2019t mention the way the city&#8217;s\u00a0housing market was being restructured to serve as an offshore investment bolthole for billions of dollars\u2019 worth of shadow currency being spirited out of China, Iran, Russia and other such kleptocracies. But back in 2015, when the profoundly caucasian Mayor Robertson attempted to dismiss Yan\u2019s findings\u2014\u201cI\u2019m very concerned with the racist tones that are implied here,\u201d Robertson said\u2014it was a smear too far.</p>\n<p>Yan\u2019s great-grandfather was allowed into Canada only after being obliged to pay the infamously racist head tax Ottawa put in effect to keep out working-class Chinese immigrants. Students, merchants and diplomats were exempt. The head tax was in place until 1923. Yan wasn&#8217;t going to put up with Robertson&#8217;s backchat, and by that time,\u00a0Vancouver\u2019s ethnic Chinese community leaders had similarly\u00a0lost their patience. White real estate moguls and politicians like Robertson persisted in\u00a0proclaiming their anti-racist bona fides and purporting to be the champions of Vancouver\u2019s Chinese community by shutting down public debates about the region\u2019s housing catastrophe. Brandon Yan, a civic activist and volunteer on Vancouver\u2019s planning commission, put it best: \u201cLet\u2019s leave it to the rich white dudes to decide what\u2019s racist, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Vancouver\u2019s \u201ccondo king\u201d Bob Rennie\u2014a primary financial backer of Robertson\u2019s NDP-tilting Vision Vancouver team and also the chief fundraiser for the NDP\u2019s adversaries in Christy Clark\u2019s Liberals\u2014had cultivated a particularly brazen habit of it. \u201cSo you had these whispers about racism being used to shut down a dialogue about affordability and the kind of city we want to build here,\u201d Andy Yan explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of moral signalling to camouflage immoral actions. It\u2019s opportunism, and it\u2019s a cover for the tremendous injustices that are emerging in the City of Vancouver and across the region. It\u2019s a weird Vancouver thing. It\u2019s very annoying. It\u2019s kale in the smoothies or something.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/the-battle-to-clean-up-b-c/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The battle to clean up B.C.</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>While the politicians and their friends in the property industry were making speeches about diversity and the importance of having sensitive feelings, foreign ownership grew to account for more than $45 billion dollars\u2019 worth of Metro Vancouver residential property. Within Vancouver city limits, 7.6 per cent of all residential properties are now owned directly by individuals \u201cwhose principal residence is outside of Canada,\u201d by the definition of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Roughly one in ten Vancouver condos are owned by non-residents. And that\u2019s just the owners we know about.</p>\n<p>Transparency International reckons that perhaps half of Vancouver\u2019s most expensive properties are owned by shell companies or trusts, with the nominal owners commonly listed as student, housewife, or homemaker. Roughly 99 per cent of the single detached houses within Vancouver\u2019s city limits are now valued in excess of $1 million. More than 20,000 Vancouver homes are vacant, year round. Vancouver\u2019s rental vacancy rate is hovering just below one per cent.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m always careful about using biomedical analogies,\u201d Yan told me the other day, \u201cbut what was like a little skin ailment, if you will, over the last 10 or 15 years, has become a full fledged cancer.\u201d Over just the past four years, throughout Metro Vancouver, homes worth $1 million or more have risen from 23 per cent of the housing market in 2014 to 73 per cent of the market now. Yan has been putting together a series of maps that show how the $1 million \u201cred line\u201d has been moving inexorably across the region, deep into the suburbs. \u201cBut what those maps don\u2019t do is they don\u2019t factor in transportation costs,\u201d Yan said. \u201cThe top two expenditures of any Canadian household is shelter and transportation. God help you if you factor in child care. The whole map might as well be red. A\u00a0number of factors have all come together to produce this catastrophic situation, but what was a small concentrated pattern in the west side of Vancouver has now metastasized to hit every single part of the region, and it\u2019s similarly metastasized into the rest of the economy.\u201d</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1100163\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ANDY_YAN.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"822\" height=\"617\" /></p>\n<p>As for where things are headed, Horgan\u2019s NDP government has raised expectations, mainly because of Attorney-General David Eby\u2019s avowed determination to chase dirty money out of Vancouver\u2019s housing market and bust up the gangland playground B.C.\u2019s provincially-licenced casinos have become\u2014money laundered through casinos has also been pouring into residential property acquisitions. In Tuesday&#8217;s throne speech, \u00a0delivered by Lt.-Gov. Judith Guichon, Horgan&#8217;s government directly addressed tax fraud, tax evasion and money laundering in the real estate market, hinting that a speculation tax is in the works.\u00a0Next week, the New Democrats release their first full budget. The housing file, however, falls mainly to the more timid Carole James, former NDP leader and now deputy premier and finance minister.\u00a0Preliminary indications aren\u2019t particularly promising.</p>\n<p>With short-term AirBnB rentals swallowing up long-term rental inventory, Yan was less than impressed with James\u2019 solution, announced last week: short-term rental outfits will now pay the eight per cent provincial sales tax, and two or three per cent in municipal taxes. \u201cThat\u2019s like taxing cigarettes to pay for lung cancer treatments,\u201d Yan said.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/ian-young-on-vancouvers-freak-show-housing-market/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ian Young on Vancouver&#8217;s &#8216;freak show&#8217; housing market</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Developing appropriately punitive taxes to discourage property-flipping and offshore pre-construction sales \u2013 those are obvious fixes. But knowing how to fix things requires a clear understanding of what\u2019s wrong, Yan says, and closing the \u201cbare trust loophole\u201d that allows property owners to hide their holdings is a must-do. Ontario closed the loophole back in the 1980s. Clark\u2019s Liberals promised to close it, but they never did.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Yan is focusing on converting hidden-away data into publicly comprehensible information. Some key information Yan has drawn from a\u00a0trove recently released by Statistics Canada\u2019s Canadian Housing Statistics Program, for instance, shows that simply building more condominiums won\u2019t do. A condo building boom in Metro Vancouver has\u00a0kept the property developers happy, but there\u2019s no evidence that the boost in supply has lessened demand or beaten back prices. Nearly one in five condos built in Vancouver since 2016 were snapped up by non-residents.</p>\n<p>To a certain extent, there\u2019s nothing new here,\u201d Yan said, pointing to the Guinness family\u2019s financing of the Lion\u2019s Gate Bridge in the 1920s, and the opening up of the British Properties on Burrard Inlet\u2019s north shore. \u201cBut what is new is the hyper-commodification of residential real estate, mixed in with an intensification of global flows of people and capital. It\u2019s just a statement in fact. We\u2019re talking about the globalization of the Chinese economy and its impacts.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yan says there may be some solution\u2014a mix of remedies, new laws, purpose-built rental housing, tax adjustments and so on\u2014that does not mean a collapse in Metro Vancouver\u2019s real estate prices. Channelling foreign investment in such a way as to serve the public interest might be possible. \u201cBut whether this comes out as a bubble-popping isn\u2019t the point. That\u2019s a secondary concern to the kind of society we want to build.\u00a0\u201cWe need to go back to civic virtues.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We need to talk about the sacrifices we are willing and we need to make for the greater good of the community. We need to have a discussion about what the public good is, and what we are willing to sacrifice to make it happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/realestateeconomy/andy-yan-the-analyst-who-exposed-vancouvers-real-estate-disaster/\">Andy Yan, the analyst who exposed Vancouver&#8217;s real estate disaster</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/economy/realestateeconomy/andy-yan-the-analyst-who-exposed-vancouvers-real-estate-disaster/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>14</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>A writer to her dying sister: &#8216;We tell ourselves lies to survive&#8217;</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/a-writer-to-her-dying-sister-we-tell-ourselves-lies-to-survive/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/a-writer-to-her-dying-sister-we-tell-ourselves-lies-to-survive/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2018 12:00:57 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Maclean's]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Before you go]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1093297</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Kelly S.

Thompson is a former captain in the Canadian Armed Forces who now lives as a writer and university instructor in Ontario.</em></p>\n<p>Once upon a time, my family would sit around the Thompson dining-room table, and my sister Meghan and I would be \u201cBill\u2019s Broads,\u201d as my Dad liked to joke. We would roll our eyes at his lame anti-feminism and tell him about what all females\u2014Meghan and me in particular\u2014were capable of. And then we\u2019d laugh. When we were younger, we laughed.</p>\n<p>It took me five years to learn to set the dining-room table at my parent&#8217;s home for three, instead of the usual four. Eventually, it became easier to just pretend my sister Meghan didn\u2019t exist than it was to admit that drugs, any number of them, had whisked her away to places we didn\u2019t care to imagine.</p>\n<p>Growing up, I wanted to be Meghan. As army brats who moved all the time, she made new friends easily because she exuded confidence and kindness; I, on the other hand, spent my childhood hiding behind my mom\u2019s dress and worrying about how I\u2019d ever get into university when I only got a B+ in grade eight phys ed. I would watch from the sidelines as my sister approached new kids and started up a game of tag, and without fail, Meghan would take my hand and bring me into the fold of friendship, protecting me from naysayers who didn\u2019t want a bratty sibling tagging along.</p>\n<p>And then there was the scar Meghan had, evidence of her childhood kidney cancer, splitting her open like a coconut from belly button to the back of her ribs. God, how I ached for that scar. It spoke of survival, toughness, determination\u2014everything I didn&#8217;t have.</p>\n<p>So I tried to be her\u2014at least, until the edges of my sister\u2019s personality disintegrated under layers of chemicals snorted up her nose or inhaled through a pipe through much of her twenties. I no longer ached for her scar; instead, I longed to forget.</p>\n<div id=\"before_you_go_email\" style=\"display: block; margin: 2em auto; padding: 1em; background: #FFFACD; border: solid 1px #ddd; box-shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(80,50,50,0.4)\">\r\n  <p style=\"font-family: sans-serif; text-align: center\">Share your tribute with the world.

She stole from our purses while we slept. There was lying\u2014so much lying. Doors were slammed. Hateful words were spewed. Items were shattered against the stencilled fruit border that lined the kitchen. This tiny, five-foot-tall woman terrified me, even though I towered over her by six inches.</p>\n<p>My response, like most young people who don\u2019t understand the disease and power of addiction, was to be angry. I essentially cut my sister out of my life\u2014tired of the late-night phone calls that were slurred to the point of incomprehension, or the missed birthdays where I would blow out candles on my cake and lick all the icing off by myself, trying so hard to pretend I didn\u2019t miss her.</p>\n<p>When we did connect, her shape passing like an unrecognizable ghost, I forced my arms to hang limp as she hugged me. There was, I thought, some decency I possessed in not telling her how she smelled like crack, or pointing out that I could see her collarbone now poking through her oversized sweatshirt. I had become a military officer, and I wanted Meghan to know what a success I was\u00a0<em>despite</em>\u00a0her lack of sisterly guidance. I&#8217;ll admit it: I wanted to rub it in her face, just a little.</p>\n<p>But my sister has always been my biggest fan anyway. People say that all the time. But Meghan has championed every piece of writing I have ever produced, touting my first publication to her circle of friends like I\u2019d just won a Pulitzer. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be a famous writer some day,\u201d she would say. \u201cI just know it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything,\u201d I would snap.\u00a0Because Meghan was a drug addict. Below me.</p>\n<p>We tell ourselves lies to survive.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, Meghan got clean with support from my parents and that same steely determination she\u2019s had since we were kids. She made a family with a man she loves. She had a son. And then something happened; she apologized to me. No qualifier. No \u201cbut I was depressed.\u201d No\u00a0\u201cbut I was lonely.\u201d No &#8220;but I had no self-esteem.\u201d\u00a0Just: sorry.</p>\n<p>A writer knows the power of words. Two in particular: Sorry. Sister. Now we talk daily, share stories, trade advice. We&#8217;re laughing again.</p>\n<p>But last April, my sister gave birth to a premature baby girl. The next day, the six-pound tumour playing hide-and-seek behind her womb ruptured, spreading cancer throughout her abdomen. She has been diagnosed with Stage 4 sarcoma, which accounts for just 1 per cent of all cancers. She always did like to be different, but there is a cost. Meghan doesn\u2019t have much longer to live.</p>\n<p>Recently, I took Meghan to her first chemo session, because she asked me to. She said I&#8217;d make it fun. I made us matching T-shirts with profanity-filled quips\u00a0about\u00a0the determination of Thompson women to give cancer the big &#8220;F&#8211;k you.&#8221; I held her hand as the poison dripped into her body, as it will nearly every week until she dies.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, I drove her home, spent of my assuaging humour but pent up with tears, knowing this was what she needed of me. But as she stood in her kitchen and put her arms around my waist, I squeezed back until my arms ached, hands rubbing up and down her spine, tears slipping into my sister&#8217;s hair.\u00a0I hugged her tightly, regretting every single moment in which I let one of my sister&#8217;s hugs pass me by unreturned.</p>\n<p>I kissed my niece and nephew goodbye, climbed into my car and sobbed, emotion cracking me open, just like a coconut. I&#8217;ve developed my own scar, this one from heart to mind and everywhere in between.</p>\n<p>This is meant to be an essay to say the things I have not said to my loved one. But Meghan will not read anything here that she doesn\u2019t already know.

In year one of the platform, Ontario\u2019s existing cap-and-trade program would remain in place, and the government would run a projected $2.8-billion deficit, though we should keep in mind these numbers are estimates. Small changes to interest rates, inflation or economic growth will change the final amounts by hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>\n<p>Years two through four of the mandate are where things get interesting.

If the plan is to both not implement the carbon tax and to scrap cap-and-trade, the platform has a revenue hole of $9.8 billion ($4.1 billion plus three years of forgone cap-and-trade revenue at $1.9 billion per year).</p>\n<p>The obvious solution to make up for the lost revenue is to simply run a deficit. If we apply the proposed $1.3 billion surplus against the $9.8 billion revenue hole, we have a three-year deficit of $8.5 billion, for an average of $2.8 billion per year. This almost exactly matches the deficit the Tories have planned for year one, so such a deficit would not be without precedent. Economically, a yearly deficit of $2- to $3 billion in a province the size of Ontario is no problem whatsoever. Politically, though, it may be difficult given the party\u2019s rhetoric on balanced budgets.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/albertas-strong-carbon-policy-is-key-to-getting-pipelines-built/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alberta\u2019s strong carbon policy is key to getting pipelines built</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The three leadership candidates are indicating that the lost carbon-tax revenue will be <a href=\"http://nationalpost.com/opinion/andrew-coyne-a-carbon-tax-is-coming-no-matter-what-ontario-pcs-say\">made up for in spending cuts</a>, but it is hard to see how this will be achieved. Over the three years, the existing platform proposes cutting nearly $12 billion from the Ontario budget in years two through four, with more than half of the dollars coming from the \u201cvalue-for-money\u201d spending cuts. Finding another nearly $10 billion to be cut is daunting; even if the Tories canceled all of their proposed new spending initiatives they would only be 60 percent of the way there.</p>\n<p>While the fiscal hole has an obvious (if not necessarily politically viable) solution, the environmental hole caused by the elimination of the carbon tax will be much harder to fill. There are three basic ways that government policy can reduce greenhouse gas emissions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Carbon pricing, through a carbon tax or cap-and-trade type mechanism</li>\n<li>Subsidy programs, for everything from green energy to home retrofits</li>\n<li>Regulations, such as vehicle emission standards</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All three leadership candidates have signed a <a href=\"http://canadafreepress.com/article/ontario-pc-leadership-candidates-sign-ctf-no-carbon-tax-pledge\">Canadian Taxpayers Federation pledge</a> to repeal cap-and-trade and to not enact a carbon tax, so option one is a non-starter. The Tory platform eliminates the subsidy programs associated with Ontario\u2019s existing cap-and-trade program; given the financial constraints of the People\u2019s Guarantee (not to mention political constraints) it is difficult to see that spending being reinstated, so option two would appear to be off the table. The Tories have, quite justifiably, <a href=\"https://www.ontariopc.ca/ontario_businesses_losing_confidence_in_the_economy\">spoken at length</a> about the very real competitive pressures faced by Ontario exporters. Given these pressures, it is hard to imagine the Tories implementing expensive new emissions rules and regulations on Ontario companies. But after rules and regulations there are no alternatives, so without those there is simply no way that the Ontario government can use policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>\n<p>The fiscal problem created by the removal of the carbon tax from the people\u2019s guarantee can be addressed, though the fixes may not be political palatable. The environmental policy gap, however, would appear to be without a solution. Unfortunately, the leadership candidates have very little time to find one.</p>\n<h3>MORE ABOUT <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/carbon-pricing/\">CARBON PRICING</a>:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/what-if-ontario-scrapped-cap-and-trade-for-a-carbon-tax/\">What if Ontario scrapped cap-and-trade for a carbon tax?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/for-atlantic-canada-its-decision-time-on-carbon-pricing/\">For Atlantic Canada it\u2019s decision time on carbon pricing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/brad-walls-provincial-problems-finally-trumped-his-national-stature/\">Brad Wall\u2019s provincial problems finally trumped his national stature</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/canadas-climate-shift-will-require-everyone-to-get-on-the-same-page/\">Canada\u2019s climate shift will require everyone to get on the same page</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/donald-trump-changes-the-climate-game/\">Donald Trump changes the climate game</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/why-corporate-america-thumbed-its-nose-at-trump-over-the-climate-deal/\">Why corporate America thumbed its nose at Trump over the climate deal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/why-canadas-carbon-pricing-plan-should-give-money-directly-to-canadians/\">Why Canada\u2019s carbon pricing plan should give money directly to Canadians</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/how-canada-can-meet-its-emissions-target/\">How provinces can help Canada meet its emissions target</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/scrapping-carbon-taxes-leaves-a-gaping-hole-in-the-ontario-pc-platform/\">Scrapping carbon taxes leaves a gaping hole in the Ontario PC platform</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/scrapping-carbon-taxes-leaves-a-gaping-hole-in-the-ontario-pc-platform/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>6</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Pipelines aren\u2019t just an Alberta issue\u2014they are crucial to national prosperity</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/pipeline-arent-just-an-alberta-issue-they-are-crucial-to-national-prosperity/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/pipeline-arent-just-an-alberta-issue-they-are-crucial-to-national-prosperity/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2018 12:00:04 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Maclean's]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Alberta Premier Rachel Notley]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[John Horgan]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Kinder Morgan]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[pipelines]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1100185</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Opinion:.

The cost of looking after hundreds of wells, pipelines and other oilfield gear left behind by bankrupt Lexin Resources Ltd. has exceeded $2 million and the bills continue to roll in, says Alberta&#8217;s Orphan Well Association. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Larry MacDougal</p></div>\n<p><em>Steve Lafleur and Ashley Stedman are analysts at the Fraser Institute.</em></p>\n<p>The governments of Alberta and British Columbia are waging an intense trade dispute over the proposed Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, which would run between Edmonton and Burnaby. The details of the feud, to date, have been well-documented. After B.C.\u2019s NDP government, led by Premier John Horgan, said it wants more time to review the project (which already has federal approval), the Alberta government, led by Premier Rachel Notley, announced a ban on B.C. wine imports and halted talks about electricity imports from its western neighbour.</p>\n<p>While this issue is often framed as Alberta (and its interests) versus B.C. (and its interests), in reality, the benefits of Alberta\u2019s natural resource sector extend beyond provincial borders. Moreover, Canadian oil will get to market one way or another. This isn\u2019t a debate about whether or not oil will get to market, but how the oil will get there, which has crucial economic and environmental implications. In short, we should think about how to maximize the benefits of Canada\u2019s natural resources while prudently managing environmental risks.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the economic implications of pipelines. At the moment, due to pipeline constraints, Canadian oil producers are selling unrefined bitumen at a fraction of the price many competitors receive. Western Canadian Select has long fetched lower prices per barrel than West Texas Intermediate for a variety of reasons, but the Canadian crude discount recently reached <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/outlook-for-canadian-heavy-oil-prices-darkens-on-widening-differential/article37724700/\">$27.50 per barrel</a>. Increasing pipeline capacity would reduce this discount by reducing export constraints. The Trans Mountain expansion would have the additional benefit of increasing access to tidewater and higher prices in the world market, rather than relying so heavily on the United States.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/how-trudeau-hasnt-left-himself-any-wiggle-room-on-pipeline-politics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trudeau hasn\u2019t left himself any wiggle room on pipeline politics</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Moreover, collecting less revenue per barrel means less money to create jobs and less tax revenue for government services and/or future tax relief. This is crucial given the <a href=\"https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/a-friend-in-need-recognizing-albertas-outsized-contribution-to-confederation.pdf\">outsized role Alberta plays in Canada\u2019s economy</a>. Between 2004 and 2014, Alberta contributed 18.8 per cent of national GDP despite having 11.6 per cent of the country\u2019s population. The province also accounted for nearly one in three jobs created in Canada during that period, resulting in a net total of 270,926 jobs.</p>\n<p>But perhaps most impressive is that Albertans paid $221.4 billion more in federal taxes (including CPP payments) than they received in programs and transfers. One can argue about whether or not that volume of net payments is excessive. But in principle, in an economic federation such as Canada, younger, more productive parts of the country subsidize the older, less productive parts. But that deal only works if we think about key national infrastructure issues as a country, rather than as isolated provinces.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/jagmeet-singh-dodges-questions-about-alberta-and-b-c-pipeline-fight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jagmeet Singh tries not to pick sides on the Alberta and B.C. pipeline fight</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>On the environmental front, the case for moving oil by pipeline is equally as strong as the economic case. Despite rhetoric from pipeline opponents, blocking a pipeline does not mean Canada\u2019s oil producers will stop producing. In reality, they will find other\u2014and riskier\u2014modes of transportation, mainly by rail. In fact, pipelines are 2.5 <a href=\"https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/safety-first-intermodal-safety-for-oil-and-gas-transportation.pdf\">times</a> safer (i.e. less likely to experience an oil spill) than rail transport. As such, anyone concerned about the environment and human health should support pipelines over rail.</p>\n<p>Whether the B.C. government likes it or not, the federal government has the <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/provinces-have-no-right-to-pipeline-conditions/article21887449/\">legal</a> jurisdiction over inter-provincial pipelines. B.C. followed a process, went along with the results, before a new government took power and decided the federal process wasn\u2019t good enough. This is not a valid reason to oppose a long-delayed pipeline project. Due diligence is important, but that due diligence is long done.</p>\n<p>While environmental issues are no doubt serious and emotional, costs and benefits must be weighed when evaluating resource projects. But again, that process has already taken place. Crucially, that doesn\u2019t mean Alberta has won and B.C. has lost. Both benefit from Alberta\u2019s resource development.

The last summer Olympics in Rio saw an all-time high for Canadian women athletes. Not only were nearly 60 per cent women, they also brought home a majority of the medals (16 out of 22), largely thanks to Penny Oleksiak\u2019s record-breaking haul.</p>\n<p>Peter Donnelly, the director of Centre for Sports Policy and co-author of\u00a0<a href=\"https://kpe.utoronto.ca/sites/default/files/the-sochi-2014-olympics---a-gender-equality-audit.pdf\">a gender equality audit of the Sochi Olympic games in 2014</a>, speculates that one reason for the discrepancy between the summer and winter games could be because Canada qualified more women in team sports in the summer games than men.</p>\n<p>In the winter games, however, that\u2019s not the case.</p>\n<p>A look at the sport-by-sport gender breakdown of this year\u2019s team gives insight into why there are more male athletes than female in Pyeongchang. One reason: the competitors for the two of the \u2018mixed gender\u2019 events are made up of men.</p>\n<p>Take the Luge, for instance. While the doubles luge event is technically open to both genders,\u00a0<a href=\"https://olympics.cbc.ca/luge/event/doubles/phase=lgx020101/index.html\">no women qualified for the event</a>\u00a0\u2013 not in Canada nor internationally. Canada sent eight athletes for luge \u2013 three of them are women, five are men.</p>\n<p>The four-man Bobsleigh has a similar pattern. Women\u2019s bobsleigh was introduced as an Olympic sport in 2002, but only as a two-man event, while male athletes were able to compete in two-man and four-man events. This year, however, the four-man event was changed from a men\u2019s-only event, to a mixed gender event.</p>\n<p>Despite the change, however, the Canadian four-man team is still composed of all men. Team Canada has a total of 18 bobsleigh athletes \u2013 12 of which are men, six are women.</p>\n<p>Canada bobsleigh star Kallie Humphries was a strong advocate for a four-man bobsleigh event for women. Thanks in large part to her pushing, the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation announced in 2014 that the it would allow mixed-gender teams. Later that year, Humphries made bobsled history by becoming the first Canadian woman to compete in a four-man event, driving an all-male crew. Humphries\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/more/humphries-to-race-with-men-in-4-man-bobsled/\">told Sportsnet in 2016</a>\u00a0that she hoped opening the four-man event to mixed gender team would \u201copen the door\u201d for women to have their own four-man event, separate from the men.</p>\n<p>The one mixed-gender event at Pyeongchang that has equal representation is curling. The mixed event had its debut at an Olympic games this year and it paid off for Canada. Canadians John Morris and Kaitlyn Lawes won the first Olympic gold medal in the event on Feb. 13.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/olympics/pyeongchang-2018-why-mixed-doubles-curling-deserves-to-stay-in-the-olympics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pyeongchang 2018: Why mixed doubles curling deserves to stay in the Olympics</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The number of athletes sent for short-track speed skating, skeleton and ski jumping are equal between genders and the number of women competing in figure skating outnumbered the men by one. All other sports \u2013 alpine skiing, bobsleigh, cross-country skiing, freestyle skiing, ice hockey, long-track speed skating, luge and snowboarding \u2013have more male athletes on the team than females.</p>\n<h3>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/olympics/\">THE OLYMPICS</a>:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/olympics/pyeongchang-2018-how-can-patrick-chan-fall-and-still-finish-first/\">Pyeongchang 2018: How can Patrick Chan fall and still finish first?</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/olympics/pyeonchang-2018-these-are-canadas-medallists/\">Pyeonchang 2018: These are Canada\u2019s medallists</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/olympics/pyeongchang-2018-patrick-chan-proves-he-can-deliver-under-pressure/\">Pyeongchang 2018: Patrick Chan proves he can deliver under pressure</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/olympics/pyeongchang-2018-non-canadian-media-explain-curling/\">What is curling?
