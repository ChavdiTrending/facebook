That&#8217;s his job at Facebook and it&#8217;s also one of the areas where the company is most vulnerable\u2014it took money from an allegedly Kremlin-linked disinformation campaign that relied on identity theft. However, special counsel Robert Mueller&#8217;s <a href=\"https://qz.com/1209619/russian-election-interference-read-the-full-text-of-robert-muellers-indictment-of-13-russian-nationals/\">indictment</a> of 13 Russians shows that buying ads was a just a component of the troll farm&#8217;s efforts, which reached a &#8220;significant&#8221; number of Americans through more direct use of Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s social networking platform.</p>\n<p>The indictment details how the trolls made reconnaissance trips to the US to gather information and target their efforts. They set up Facebook groups aiming to stoke divisions and radicalize Americans, pushing bogus causes like &#8220;United Muslims of America,&#8221; &#8220;Blacktivist,&#8221; and &#8220;Army of Jesus.&#8221; They created fake accounts that aimed to become \u201cleaders of public opinion in the US,\u201d which would then push the same divisive agenda. They organized rallies over false issues and persuaded real Americans to go to them. They encouraged minorities not to vote and pushed allegations of voter fraud.</p>\n<p>All this began in 2014 and Facebook, alongside Twitter, Instagram (which it owns), and YouTube, was a crucial tool in the campaign\u2014in fact, according to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/17/technology/indictment-russian-tech-facebook.html\">New York Times</a> (paywall), the indictment mentions Facebook and Instagram a combined 41 times, compared to just 9 for Twitter. It reached <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/technology/facebook-google-russia.html\">126 million people</a> (paywall) through Facebook alone. So, to cite the increased ad spend after the election, with the implicit suggestion that the campaign didn&#8217;t affect the vote, is deeply misleading.</p>\n<h2>There were a lot of ads bought before the election</h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s no doubt that attempts to sow discord in US society continued after the election. It would also make sense that the Russian operatives would boost their ad spending\u2014there seems a reasonable amount of evidence to conclude that it was a cheap and effective source of influence over the American public, especially after the election when voting-directed organizing would no longer make sense as a tactic. Regardless, the indictment says Russian propagandists were spending thousands of dollars per month on Facebook ads as early as mid-2015.</p>\n<h2>The troll campaign did support Donald Trump</h2>\n<p>Goldman is right to say that swaying the election&#8217;s result wasn&#8217;t the Russians&#8217; main aim. The hackers stated goal was &#8220;spread[ing] distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general,&#8221; according to the indictment. Despite Goldman&#8217;s claims, this is regularly reported in the media\u2014after Mueller\u2019s indictment was released, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/17/technology/indictment-russian-tech-facebook.html\">New York Times</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-16/mueller-shows-how-russians-sowed-discord-with-dirty-tricks\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-russia/u-s-grand-jury-indicts-13-russian-nationals-in-election-meddling-probe-idUSL2N1Q619M\">Reuters</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/02/mueller-roadmap/553604/\">the Atlantic</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/16/586361956/as-an-american-tragedy-unfolds-russian-agents-sow-discord-online\">NPR</a> all published stories that described Russia\u2019s aim as sowing \u201cchaos\u201d or \u201cdiscord.\u201d</p>\n<p>However, that doesn&#8217;t mean affecting the election wasn&#8217;t part of the plan. The grand objective was to &#8220;interfere with US political and electoral processes, including the 2016 US presidential election,&#8221; and the indictment explicitly says the Russian digital operatives saw supporting Trump and Hillary Clinton&#8217;s Democratic primary opponent Bernie Sanders as the best way to achieve that.  One internal message sent around the troll farm said: \u201cUse any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump\u2014we support them).\u201d</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://qz.com/783739/vladimir-putin-doesnt-love-donald-trump-as-much-as-you-might-think/\">Quartz reported</a> before the election, most in Moscow believed that Clinton would win. The campaign was aimed at weakening her and America&#8217;s political system\u2014the fact that Trump actually won was, presumably, a bonus.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/ap_18047803458664-e1518968518721.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/ap_18047803458664-e1518968518721.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Trump Russia Probe</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Trump&#8217;s biggest obstacle to fixing the trade deficit?

Many expect Trump to prioritize his own agenda this year in an effort to appeal to those voters. And at the top of the list is Trump&#8217;s grand ambition of shrinking the yawning US trade deficit.</p>\n<p>The problem is that Trump&#8217;s tax cut could help snuff out his chances of realizing that grand ambition, <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/blog/trumps-tax-success-expense-his-trade-agenda?sp_mid=55998345&amp;sp_rid=Z2dAcXouY29tS0\">argues Brad Setser</a>, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>\n<p>The decrease in revenue from tax cuts, alongside hopped-up <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/08/congress-massive-budget-deal-2018-398189\">spending bill Trump just signed</a>, will drive up the US fiscal deficit. All else equal, that means a widening of America&#8217;s current account deficit\u2014a measure of an economy&#8217;s excess of <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/010715/what-difference-between-current-account-deficit-and-trade-deficit.asp\">investment over savings</a> that includes the trade deficit as well as other measures. Using the IMF&#8217;s coefficient, Setser estimates that these changes could increase the US current account deficit to 4% of GDP, up an extra percentage point.</p>\n<p>The current account deficit increase could, however, be even bigger.</p>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"SJvDn9HPf\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"><img src=\"https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_SJvDn9HPf.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<p>Setser suspects that the US economy is currently operating pretty close to full capacity. One sign of that is the fact that the unemployment rate hovering just above 4%. That will mean any additional demand created by the spending stimulus will drive up Americans&#8217; net imports. That, naturally, benefits other countries. Plus, Americans will have to borrow more<strong> </strong>to pay for those additional<strong> </strong>foreign goods.</p>\n<p>If that happens, &#8220;the US would get stuck with the debt while the United States\u2019 big trading partners would get the stimulus,&#8221; writes Setser.&#8221; A poorly timed fiscal expansion thus could end up making China, Korea, Japan, Germany, and the other big exporting economies great.&#8221; (In fact, that seems to be what happened in the fourth quarter of 2017, he notes. Though domestic demand picked up, it didn&#8217;t boost US output that much, since more than half of the GDP growth generated by increased demand was spent on imports. This explains why, despite that jump in domestic demand, overall growth slid.)</p>\n<p>Things might go differently, of course. Anything that changes how foreigners invest in the US will also affect the trade deficit. For instance, if the US Federal Reserve holds off on raising short-term interest rates, the trade deficit might not budge much, says Setser. Higher rates on US bonds, on the other hand, would widen the deficit, by hiking up the interest payments the government pays on its external debt.</p>\n<p>If financial flows stay steady\u2014and the trade deficit stays where it is\u2014that fatter fiscal deficit caused by the tax cuts would have to be offset somewhere else in US accounts, as either households or businesses upped their own savings rates. How might that play out? Household savings could rise either through falling unemployment or a decline in consumer debt, or a combination of the two. But it&#8217;s hard to see unemployment dipping much lower\u2014or, for that matter, a reversal in the <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc\">steady rise in household borrowing</a>.</p>\n<p>More plausible is that Trump tax cut raises corporate savings by shifting of wealth away from the government and households. That would likely flow on to the wealthiest Americans through stock buybacks and dividend payments, driving up total savings, since rich folks tend to consume a much smaller share of their income. That could even help achieve the Trump dream of narrowing the trade gap, all else being equal.</p>\n<p>More likely, though, is that the US&#8217;s total savings rate will fall. The transfer of wealth to the rich achieved by Trump&#8217;s tax cuts will force down household savings, hurting the US&#8217;s long-term prospects, as Michael Pettis, finance professor at Peking University, <a href=\"http://carnegieendowment.org/chinafinancialmarkets/71359\">unravels here in detail</a>. Since US businesses are not starved for cash, shifting more money from households and the government to corporate coffers is <a href=\"https://qz.com/1144721/tax-bill-2017-the-reagan-corporate-tax-cut-didnt-work/\">unlikely to up productive investment</a> in a way that spurs sustainable growth.</p>\n<p>Instead, middle-class households would be stuck absorbing the adjustment, offsetting the increased savings of the wealthy with a decline in their own. Unfortunately for them, saving less occurs either through layoffs or rising debt, or a combo of the two.

Musicians weaved past picnickers on their way to the stage. Strands from a bamboo flute drifted by, snatches of drums, a man playing a moon-shaped lute. We\u2019d both had some wine.</p>\n<p>\u201cSince I moved here,\u201d Samantha whispered, looking sneaky, \u201cI\u2019ve come a lot closer to death.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I said, beaming over at her. Finally, someone had said it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the mountains, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re so big,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re so small.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s so quiet, all of the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>We watched our friends divvy up a wedge of Brie a few feet away. It occurred to me, not for the first time, that I might have to stay in the Berkshires for the rest of my life. This was a scary thought, but I was getting used to those. I reached for some cheese.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">***</p>\n<p>When I moved to the Berkshires at age 28, I was overflowing with worries about the life decisions I\u2019d made: deciding to move across the country to go to grad school, and then deciding, after three years, to drop out. Some recent tumult in my romantic life didn\u2019t help, either. \u201cYou remind me of Pig Pen,\u201d one friend said to me at the time, referring to the Peanuts character surrounded by clouds of dirt. \u201cBut instead of dirt, it\u2019s chaos.\u201d</p>\n<p>I was embarrassed about my own indecision, scared about what I was going to do with my life, and convinced that all my peers were judging me. So I moved to the Berkshires\u2014the only place I could find a job\u2014and began to marinate in self-doubt and existential dread. I didn\u2019t know anyone who lived there. All the coffee shops closed by 6 pm. It was the Bermuda Triangle of cell-phone reception.</p>\n<p>People love the country because having plenty of space to think and move around sounds like a good way to reduce stress. But the downside of living in a place where you feel outnumbered by cows is there are fewer distractions from your anxieties. The country did force me to just be; but that was a hard task, at first, because what I <em>was</em> back then was kind of chaotic.</p>\n<p>In the quiet of the mountains, I felt like I could suddenly hear everything\u2014the tapping of a woodpecker and the wind rustling the leaves of the oak tree outside my bedroom, yes. But also every insecure thought swirling around in my head. And in order to get comfortable with the realities of my life, I needed to let those scared, angry, worried voices finish what they had to say.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">***</p>\n<p>My first few months in the country were ablaze with positive thinking. I finally taught myself how to ride a bike, wobbling in loops around an empty parking lot before braving the roads. I took up a lot of complicated DIY T-shirt projects. I got a regular gig writing features for the local paper and drove around interviewing townspeople about their various occupations\u2014a three-generation family that sold silk-screened calendars, a woman who&#8217;d written a cookbook about how to make pop tarts and pickles.</p>\n<p>The area wasn&#8217;t overflowing with young people. But I hit it off with Samantha, a whip-smart librarian with a collection of perilously high heels, and her genial, sarcastic husband Jim. They&#8217;d moved to the Berkshires from Chicago the year before, and were equally startled to find themselves in a place so heavy with silence. We split orders of fried pickles at the local pub and forged our way to a Halloween party at a historic tavern in the midst of an early-fall snowstorm.</p>\n<p>Was this the life I&#8217;d imagined for myself in my late twenties? It was not. But I was doing fine\u2014right up until winter fully descended. Shut up indoors and hiding from frostbite, I suddenly noticed that I was super lonely. And while I\u2019d imagined that the ruminative beauty of a New England winter might get my creative writing juices flowing, in practice I found that being alone with my thoughts sent me into anxiety spirals.</p>\n<p>Cooped up with my computer and endless cups of coffee, I thought about how isolated I\u2019d become, and how it was all my fault. I&#8217;d taken people and lucky breaks for granted, and walked away from good things just because the possibility of something even greater was waggling in my peripheral vision. As past complaints came to mind, I composed lists of all the things I wished that I\u2019d done differently on spare scraps of paper throughout the day, the way normal people jotted down groceries and errands.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot standing up for myself enough,\u201d I scribbled on the back of a pharmacy receipt. \u201cCaring too much about other people&#8217;s opinions,\u201d I wrote in the margins of my notebook during a meeting. \u201cLeaving New York. Grad school, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was a pretty cool hobby. The problem was, I couldn\u2019t locate any kind of roadmap for people who were convinced they\u2019d ruined their lives by being too dumb to understand what they wanted. Why weren\u2019t more humans talking about this?</p>\n<p>There were some novels and movies and TV shows about regret, but they didn\u2019t tend to be very solutions-oriented. Walter White regretted losing his chance to be a successful millionaire, so he became a meth kingpin. Mr. Rochester regretted marrying his first wife, so he locked her in an attic and thumped around shouting at governesses unexpectedly. These were not helpful role models.</p>\n<p>The most practical advice I could find on regret came from a <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/kathryn_schulz_don_t_regret_regret\">TED talk</a> by a woman who wished she hadn\u2019t gotten her tattoo of a compass rose. Her words of wisdom boiled down to \u201cgive it time.&#8221; This made me feel desperate and impatient, so I went in the other direction. I decided to make myself so busy that time would disappear.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">***</p>\n<p>Samantha, Jim and I began going to trivia night at a bar near their house. Each Wednesday we&#8217;d gather to sip pints of PBR and hiss the names of dead presidents and early rap songs under our breath, so our competitors wouldn&#8217;t hear.</p>\n<p>We got to know the other regular players: a solitary man rumored to have swept Jeopardy twice back in the 1990s; the local mycologist, who smuggled in flasks of black-truffle vodka that he passed around under the table. <del></del><del></del></p>\n<p>In the summer, I joined a community garden, and spent eight hours a week crouched over rows of purple string beans that grew long and bumpy as witches\u2019 fingers. I was intimidated by the graphic designers and jewelry-makers who worked in the garden with me, all casually beautiful in an Oil Method way and knowledgeable enough to know that dead-heading was an action unrelated to Jerry Garcia. After a while I felt comfortable enough to swap pickling techniques and calendula skin treatments with them.</p>\n<p>Dating! I was doing that too. Pickings were slim in the Berkshires, but I gave it my sporting best. I went out with a painter, a political aide, a teacher, a lawyer, a couple of journalists. My favorite was an adorably discombobulated reporter who swore a lot, loved <em>The X-Files</em>, and was launching a deep-dive investigation into the recent surge of bobcat sightings in Western Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>But mostly I filled my time by working. In addition to my full-time job, I had a pop culture blog with a few friends and was freelancing for more than one paper. And after a while, I took on a recurring gig that transformed my social life: I started taking party pictures.</p>\n<p>The job was pretty straightforward. Once or twice a week, I&#8217;d drive out to a hospital fundraising gala or a retro-space-themed dance party. Then I&#8217;d march up to strangers, brandishing a camera and a notebook, and ask if they minded if I took their picture. Most of the time\u2014much to my surprise, at first\u2014they didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>I learned picture protocol fast. Shoot from the waist up, no more than four people at a time. In group shots, get everybody&#8217;s arms inside the frame, or else they\u2019ll look like sock puppets. When a party guest gives a goofy fake name, laugh obligingly. (This last rule sometimes backfired. Early on, a smiling man in a suit told me his name was Smitty Pignatelli. I chuckled and asked what his real name was. Smitty Pignatelli was his real name, and he was our state representative.)</p>\n<p>Taking photos gave me an excuse to slip inside the worlds people had made for themselves in the Berkshires. So this was what everyone had been up to that first isolated winter, while I padded around writing myself recriminating notes on napkins! There were artists&#8217; retreats in converted barns that culminated in raucous dance parties; buffet dinners spread out on the terrace of Edith Wharton\u2019s gabled home in Lenox. I snapped pictures of farmers\u2019 brunches and bluegrass concerts, art openings and Halloween parties in tents stacked high with local gin and bales of hay.</p>\n<p>I loved talking to Berkshires natives and transplants at these parties, learning how they\u2019d started their own nonprofits and breweries and theater companies. Of course, a lot of people had had money to begin with, which played an important part in determining whether they could make a go of becoming a handbag designer or green juice guru. But some of them hadn\u2019t had much, and still didn\u2019t. This was a place where people could try to reinvent themselves. And the longer I stayed, the lighter and steadier I became. I was less worried that I\u2019d die alone and unfulfilled in the middle of an ice storm, and more confident that I might be able to grow into a different kind of person.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">***</p>\n<p>Part of the reason I\u2019d been so miserable in the Berkshires that first winter was that I\u2019d worried my loneliness there would be permanent, it would never change. It was an easy thing to believe, trundling down picture-postcard streets that looked like they hadn\u2019t altered a brick since Norman Rockwell painted them in 1967. But the longer I lived there, learning new names, accepting and extending invitations, erasing one set of memories in order to make room for the next, the more I understood: I couldn\u2019t even stop change if I wanted to.</p>\n<p>Almost two years after I\u2019d moved to Western Massachusetts, I began looking for a new job in earnest, and I caught a break. Within a month I was in New York, a city I&#8217;d left once before and missed ever since.</p>\n<p>The day I moved back to the city, I thought about that old Frank Sinatra chestnut: <em>If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere. </em>But the truth is, making it\u2014building a big, messy life for yourself that you can be proud of\u2014is a plenty hard job any place you might go.</p>\n<p>After years among those mortality-evoking mountains, I still felt small, but not scared. I was ready to start over. I already missed trivia night and wading down rivers and sun-warmed tomatoes and all my old friends.</p>\n<p>Standing on the deck of my new apartment, listening to the roar of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, I imagined a woman like me, 150 miles away in the Berkshires, carrying her first box of books into a farmhouse. I felt like she would: Just lucky to be there, lucky to choose.</p>\n<p><em>An earlier version of this essay was published on The Toast. </em></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/tree-jpg.png\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/tree-jpg.png\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">tree</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>A nineties Japanese mini car is the unlikely taxi of choice in one of Nigeria&#8217;s biggest cities</title>\n\t\t<link>https://qz.com/1191101/nigerias-ibadan-nissan-micra-taxis-flood-the-roads/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 12:05:55 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Adepoju and Sunday Olaoye (Photos)]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ibadan]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Lagos]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Nigeria]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Nissan]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Nissan Micra]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[okada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Taxify]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[uber Nigeria]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://qz.com/1191101//</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Ibadan, Nigeria In Lagos and Abuja, Uber and Taxify are competing in Nigeria\u2019s still relatively new e-hailing taxi space.

But as rapid modernization expands car traffic there&#8217;s sometimes dangerous competition on the city\u2019s major (largely narrow) roads between buses, unmarked taxis, motorbikes popularly known as Okada, private car owners and the Nissan Micra taxi drivers.<strong> </strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1210330\" style=\"max-width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-1210330 size-hero-m\" src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_3210-e1518953453258.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640&strip=all\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_3210-e1518953453258.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640 640w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_3210-e1518953453258.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1280 1280w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_3210-e1518953453258.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300 300w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_3210-e1518953453258.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=700 700w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_3210-e1518953453258.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">&#8220;Pile in.&#8221;</p></div>\n<p>The original Micra, the K10, was introduced in October 1982 in Japan to compete for market share with the Honda City, Daihatsu Charade, Suzuki Cultus, and Toyota Starlet. Its selling point is its low fuel consumption provided by its peculiarly small engine equipped with five-speed manual gearboxes. The most popular version in Ibadan is the early nineties, K11 version launched in 1992. While both left and right-handed versions are imported, they are often adapted by auto-mechanics to Nigeria\u2019s road usage rule that only left-handed cars should be allowed on Nigeria\u2019s roads.</p>\n<p>The Micra is very light, it weighs less than half of an average sedan or saloon car making it both easier to maneuver and for dangerous swerves much to the annoyance of other road users. Local police and road safety officers see Micra taxi drivers as the biggest safety threat on the city\u2019s roads.</p>\n<p>Ibadan\u2019s Micra taxis take the same number of passengers as you would normally have in a regular-sized sedan or saloon car. It is not unusual for drivers to make up to six people literally on top of each other in a mini car that was really designed to probably take no more than four average-sized adults.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1210332\" style=\"max-width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-hero-m wp-image-1210332\" src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_3219-e1518952296249.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640&strip=all\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"486\" srcset=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_3219-e1518952296249.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640 640w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_3219-e1518952296249.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1280 1280w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_3219-e1518952296249.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300 300w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_3219-e1518952296249.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=700 700w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_3219-e1518952296249.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">&#8220;Ready?&#8221;</p></div>\n<p>No one really knows for certain how Micra got to be Ibadan\u2019s taxi of choice. One tale goes that an unemployed engineering graduate served as the trailblazer. Another legend claims a foreign-based Nigerian returnee brought the first set of Micras over<em>.</em> What is however widely true was the positive testimony of early users prompted others to start saving money to buy theirs\u2019.</p>\n<p>Some Micra cab drivers highlight the critical role played by car dealers with favorable financing terms to help drivers pay for the cars in installments once they can present guarantors, and the reluctance of passengers to pay more even during fuel scarcity\u2014compelling the drivers to consider affordable options that wouldn\u2019t have meant passengers pay more. The Micra was an obvious choice since it is cheap to maintain and small enough to provide a better fighting chance during heavy traffic.</p>\n<p>At the end of Odejayi Street, off Old Ife Road Ibadan, Kunle Adebayo, an auto mechanic, oversees a work yard demarcated by the fence of the popular Queen of Apostles Grammar School. The workshop is shared with a bodywork specialist and a painter. On a Saturday morning, the three were working on Sodeeq Amusan\u2019s first Nissan Micra.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1210331\" style=\"max-width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-1210331 size-hero-m\" src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/20180103_125640-e1518952127483.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640&strip=all\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"439\" srcset=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/20180103_125640-e1518952127483.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640 640w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/20180103_125640-e1518952127483.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1280 1280w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/20180103_125640-e1518952127483.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300 300w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/20180103_125640-e1518952127483.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=700 700w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/20180103_125640-e1518952127483.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Putting it back together.</p></div>\n<p>\u201cThey are smaller than regular cars and are slightly larger than tricycles (popular called Keke NAPEP) which means when there is traffic, they can meander their way through spaces that are too narrow for regular cars,\u201d says Adebayo.</p>\n<p>Sodeeq and Adebayo both say the Micra is the most fuel economic brand on the road.

My mother had just passed away and I felt lost and like my mourning would never end. Ed travels so much for work and he wasn\u2019t even trying to be there for me. I told him many times that I needed more\u2014that I needed him to be there for me\u2014but nothing ever changed. So I detached, emotionally and physically.</p>\n<p>Really, I was craving attention\u2014the high that comes from knowing that you\u2019re still wanted and attractive to <em>somebody</em>. I guess you could say my mother\u2019s death pushed me straight into a midlife crisis because I started caring about my looks more, putting a little more makeup on in the morning, taking a little more time with my night routine. And I started working out, too. I lost all that extra weight I\u2019d packed on over 20+ years of marriage and several children.</p>\n<p>I decided I was going to post an ad on Craigslist for the sole purpose of having an affair. My ad said that I was looking for somebody\u2014a workout buddy\u2014who wanted to work out with me at <em>my</em> gym. I got hundreds of responses but one, in particular, caught my attention. He sent me a photo of his body, which was\u2014and I\u2019m not exaggerating\u2014spectacular. He was years younger than me, former military, and married with children.</p>\n<p>I responded, and I was hooked. He seemed too good to be true. He sent me rapid-fire e-mails with photos of himself (full body, naked) and his face. I started feeling like I was being catfished because I was pushing to meet up, but he kept telling me to <em>be patient</em>. On a whim, I looked up the name he\u2019d given me on Facebook. I never thought that he\u2019d be using his real name\u2014that\u2019s a recipe for disaster, personally and career-wise. But there he was: flesh and blood, with a <em>gorgeous</em> wife. I thought, <em>what the hell does this guy want with me?</em> That she was basically perfect only made me feel better about myself, and it fueled my obsession to finally meet up with him.</p>\n<p>We started chatting on video and he showed me his surroundings. Turns out, he was working overseas and would be home in a few weeks. The more obsessed I became with him, the more he backed off. The more I backed off\u2014and I did, a few times\u2014the more interested he seemed to become. It was a cat and mouse game. I finally told him\u2014\u201clisten, this isn\u2019t about sex for me. This is about getting the attention I\u2019m not getting at home. And if you\u2019re unavailable, that just makes everything worse. So please stop texting me. Stop calling me. Just let me move on.\u201d I left it up to him because I was sure I didn\u2019t have the strength to cut him off myself.</p>\n<p>The silence would last a day, and then he was back at it. Around Christmastime, he called me up and told me, \u201cI want to meet you tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>We met in his car. He kissed like a cow. He had an extremely large nose, and he smelled weird. And I thought to myself, \u201cGod, I\u2019m not attracted to this guy at all.\u201d But I didn\u2019t know how to get out of there. He asked if I wanted to see his privates and I said <em>yes</em>, mostly because I thought that I\u2019d give him oral and then get out of there and never have to see him again. I did it, and then I left. He texted me after, \u201cthat was hot.\u201d</p>\n<p>I tried to break things off again, but he just kept going with the texts and photos. He seemed at once very insecure and very full of himself. He craved the ego boost, I guess. He told me he\u2019d only had two previous affairs, and that he\u2019d never before posted on Craigslist. And slowly but surely, he started pushing the envelope: he wanted to come over to my place while my husband was away and the kids were at school. I said no.</p>\n<p>I met him again, same place as before, same drill. Afterwards, I sent him a text saying that he felt too uninvolved and that it wasn\u2019t working for me. And he never wrote me back.</p>\n<p>Days go by with no word. I go back on Craigslist and, sure enough, I see that he\u2019s posted an ad with a photo of his body on it. It was one of the photos he\u2019d sent me. I made a different e-mail account and responded to his ad. And the e-mails and photos that followed, from him, were exactly the same as the first time around. He had a routine\u2014he\u2019d done this before.</p>\n<p>I did a little bit of digging and I saw that he\u2019d left a photo tag in one of his photos\u2014it was taken two years ago, in 2016, and the tag had his home address on it. It almost felt like he wanted to get caught. He gave me his real name. I know his home address. I know his employer. I know what his wife and kids look like. It would not be difficult for me to cause problems for him.</p>\n<p>I feel stupid. I shared things with him that are very intimate. I feel embarrassed about what I did. He\u2019s talking to other girls\u2014I\u2019m certain of it. For him, this was just another fling. And I\u2019m married with kids. I\u2019m unhappy I\u2019m doing this. My husband and I have talked about separating but that doesn\u2019t excuse what I\u2019m doing. I know I\u2019m still cheating.</p>\n<p>Things at home are not fixable. Ed doesn\u2019t want therapy. He&#8217;s let himself go and gained a ton of weight. I\u2019m scared to leave. I\u2019m scared of the unknown. How are the kids going to react to a divorce? Can I afford to leave? Ideally, it would end if Ed had enough confidence to get out. I certainly don\u2019t. So I&#8217;m back at it on Craigslist. I&#8217;m talking to other guys now. It feels good to get all this attention. This could go on indefinitely.</p>\n<p><em>Read more Craigslist Confessionals <a href=\"https://qz.com/re/craigslist-confessional/\">here</a>.

Sure, I&#8217;ve watched them, and I have to say, not only are they mostly humdrum or clever without being smart, they&#8217;re not as interesting as what&#8217;s happening on <em>Law &amp; Order: SVU </em>every week.</p>\n<p>Storylines that are ripped from the headlines are, of course, <em>Law &amp; Order</em>&#8216;s bread and butter as a franchise, but no other mainstream show, has weighed in so boldly on the increasingly pitched battle over gender, identity, rape culture and consent. If it was a new Netflix  or Hulu original, this season of <em>SVU\u2014</em>it&#8217;s 19th\u2014would launch a thousand think pieces.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1208810\" style=\"max-width: 330px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"size-hero-s wp-image-1208810\" src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-15-at-2-27-34-pm.png?w=320&#038;h=235\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"235\" srcset=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-15-at-2-27-34-pm.png?w=320&amp;h=235 320w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-15-at-2-27-34-pm.png?w=300&amp;h=221 300w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-15-at-2-27-34-pm.png 578w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is an official piece of SVU merch.</p></div>\n<p>One story arc that developed over several episodes this season\u2014and if you haven&#8217;t been watching, SPOILERS follow\u2014featured Brooke Shields playing a grandmother whose grandson was adopted by Lt. Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay, for the uninitiated). Long story, but the mom was a runaway, Benson tried to help her, but she died at the hands of an awful boyfriend. Typical <em>SVU</em> stuff.</p>\n<p>At first, Benson is suspicious, but then they all bond until granny kidnaps the boy. Clearly, there are some problems with this story line, but after Benson rescues her son, the writers really hammer home the takeaways: working moms are good moms. Small-minded rural racism and xenophobia is bad. Heteronormative, biological families are not the only families.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1209740\" style=\"max-width: 330px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"wp-image-1209740 size-hero-s\" src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/img_3285-1.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=320&strip=all\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/img_3285-1.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=320 320w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/img_3285-1.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640 640w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/img_3285-1.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><!-- caption placeholder --></p></div>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure there needed to be a Hargitay-Shields wrestling match to make all those points, but all around, that&#8217;s a lot of message for one cop show. (On the pure entertainment level, this story arc is concluded with a Peter Gallagher-Ice T staredown that is one of the best things I have ever seen on television. Or anywhere, really.)</p>\n<p>In an episode titled <em>Flight Risk </em>that originally aired on Jan. 17, intrepid district attorney Rafael Barba (Ra\u00fal Esparza) convenes a grand jury against an airline that has displayed systematic discrimination against female pilots. He argues that the company should be charged with grand larceny because of the loss of professional advancement and wages.</p>\n<p>Yes, <em>SVU</em> is making the case for lady reparations. I&#8217;ve read a fair amount of feminist theory, and plenty of arguments for placing a dollar value on labor traditionally done by women. But until this episode, I&#8217;ve never heard the case made in this way before before and it has some pretty radical implications.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1209741\" style=\"max-width: 330px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"size-hero-s wp-image-1209741\" src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/img_3286.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=320&strip=all\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"268\" srcset=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/img_3286.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=320 320w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/img_3286.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640 640w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/img_3286.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><!-- caption placeholder --></p></div>\n<p>While this season is particularly politically charged, it&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s new territory for the show.</p>\n<p><em>SVU </em>tackles issues like gender non-conformity with a sort of characteristic New York City bluntness. There&#8217;s an exchange in episode that aired on Sept. 30, 2015 with the awkward title <em>Transgender Bridge</em> about a bullied transgender teen that goes something like this:</p>\n<p>Cop 1: Ah, I don&#8217;t know about these transgenders, what&#8217;s up with that?</p>\n<p>Cop 2: I mean, me either, but why would a dude wear a dress and catch all that flack unless he really wanted to, ya know?</p>\n<p>Cop 1: Ya gotta point there.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1209746\" style=\"max-width: 330px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"size-hero-s wp-image-1209746\" src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/img_3287.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=320&strip=all\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"275\" srcset=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/img_3287.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=320 320w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/img_3287.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640 640w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/img_3287.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Olivia Benson, a brief history in text.</p></div>\n<p>If you watch the <em>SVU </em>reruns\u2014which are on cable pretty much every moment of every day\u2014it won&#8217;t take long to find an episode in which transgender women are portrayed as prostitutes and referred to using a whole host of derogatory terms that are really cringe worthy. This newer approach involves a boneheaded but good-hearted cop with a thick Brooklyn accent framing the questions that viewers may be asking themselves. It doesn\u2019t treat fans like idiots for not automatically understanding everything about gender and sexuality. This tactic that strikes me as a pretty effective in our fraught social environment, even if it\u2019s usually dependent on lame dialogue.</p>\n<p>In the same way that the show is willing to represent viewers who might not understand transgender issues on screen\u2014albeit in a slightly hamfisted manner\u2014Lt. Benson, the series&#8217; incomparable heroine and fearless leader, is a stand in for pretty much every bad thing that can happen to a woman. While she has not been raped on the show, per se, she has come close several times\u2014once while undercover in a women&#8217;s prison, once during an abduction by a violent sociopath. She is the product of rape, and her alcoholic mother never let her forget it. She has been taken hostage more than once. She has had an HIV scare.</p>\n<p>Her burning and requited love for her long-time partner, Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni) and string of go-nowhere relationships with journalists who use her as a source, lawyers who turn out to be gay, and other cops who turn out to be toxic, has been undercut by occasional hints that she might actually be a lesbian. You can come for Olivia Benson, but first know that life itself has already tried it, and yet here she still is\u2014a working mom, in a sensible heel suitable both for kicking ass and chasing the occasional perp.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t blame viewers for not being interested in a lot of network television right now, especially procedurals. A show like <a href=\"http://www.cbs.com/shows/ncis/\"><em>NCIS</em></a> is an advertisement for the security state; <a href=\"http://www.cbs.com/shows/criminal_minds/\"><em>Criminal Minds</em></a> is like an FBI recruiting video, and the <a href=\"http://www.cbs.com/shows/swat/\">CBS show</a> <em>S.W.A.T. </em>comes across like a show someone paid the network to develop as damage control for the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/18/us/forced-entry-warrant-drug-raid.html\">terrible public image SWAT teams have</a> earned themselves. None of the fun or creativity that was on display in say, the early years of <em>CSI, </em>is anywhere to be found. <em>SVU</em> though, ceased being just a show and started being more of a provocateur at some point after Meloni left. It stopped chasing serial killers and rapists who lurk in the bushes and started grappling with American sexual politics.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s so much excellent television that there&#8217;s no reason to go looking on prime time for something new to watch. Streaming hits <a href=\"https://qz.com/1111571/stranger-things-how-many-people-are-watching-netflix-shows/\">like <em>Stranger Things</em> and <em>Game of Thrones</em> have caught up to network television</a> in terms of the number of viewers. And frankly, as much as I love <em>SVU</em>, I watch it because I&#8217;m fascinated by the way it&#8217;s participating in the larger conversation about gender and sexuality and because I miss living in New York City. I don&#8217;t tune in because it&#8217;s great television\u2014although maybe that is one way in which television can be great in this day and age.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rtr30wo1-e1518723913894.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rtr30wo1-e1518723913894.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Law ad Order: SVU cast member Mariska Hargitay takes part in a panel discussion at the NBC Universal Summer Press Day 2012 in Pasadena, California</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-15-at-2-27-34-pm.png?w=320\" medium=\"image\" />\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/img_3285-1.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=320\" medium=\"image\" />\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/img_3286.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=320\" medium=\"image\" />\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/img_3287.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=320\" medium=\"image\" />\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Kate Middleton is about to debut as an art curator</title>\n\t\t<link>https://quartzy.qz.com/1210212/kate-middleton-is-about-to-debut-as-an-art-curator/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 08:00:45 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Anne Quito]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[alice in wonderland]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[art]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Duchess of Cambridge]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Kate Middleton]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Lewis Carroll]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[London]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[National Portrait Gallery]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[photography]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[UK]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[UK National Portrait Gallery]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Victorian Giants: The Birth of Art Photography]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://qz.com/1210212//</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Kate Middleton will make her official debut as an art curator later this month.

They watched as motorcades of luxury cars and blue-light security vehicles darted between official homes. They eagerly shared leaks over WhatsApp from closed-door meetings of the African National Congress. Press briefings and public statements were cloaked in double-speak that were clearly meant for other politicians, not the people. And the people responded in <a href=\"https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2018-02-14-in-memes--some-of-the-best-reactions-to-zumaresigns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hilarious memes</a>.</p>\n<p>This was how South Africa\u2019s new president <a href=\"https://qz.com/1208494/cyril-ramaphosa-is-south-africas-president-after-jacob-zuma-resigns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">came to be chosen</a>\u2014back door dealings and <a href=\"https://qz.com/1205914/jacob-zuma-recalled-south-africas-anc-fires-the-president-but-his-departure-remains-uncertain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">political brinkmanship</a>. The removal of now former president Jacob Zuma gripped South Africa as it seemed the wily yet embattled president was digging in his heels one last time, right down to the <a href=\"https://qz.com/1207765/jacob-zuma-resigns-as-president-of-south-africa-with-immediate-effect/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">last paragraph</a> of his resignation speech. He was pitted against his deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa, the skilled negotiator who promised to bring closure to what has been difficult era in post-apartheid South Africa.</p>\n<p>After more than twelve hours of negotiations, the party formally recalled Zuma but he held on. The final stroke was the <a href=\"https://qz.com/1207066/zuma-recall-anc-to-remove-jacob-zuma-in-vote-of-no-confidence-zuma-digs-in-his-heels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">public arrest</a> of Zuma\u2019s wealthy friends, <a href=\"https://qz.com/825789/state-capture-jacob-zuma-the-guptas-and-corruption-in-south-africa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Guptas</a>, and the threat of removing Zuma through <a href=\"https://qz.com/1207066/zuma-recall-anc-to-remove-jacob-zuma-in-vote-of-no-confidence-zuma-digs-in-his-heels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a vote of no-confidence</a> in parliament, even if it meant siding with the opposition.</p>\n<p>To outsiders it may not seem that way, but this was South African democracy at play. It\u2019s happened before, when the party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/20/southafrica1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">removed former president</a> Thabo Mbeki in 2008 after a bitter power struggle. These recalls are dramatic and traumatic for a relatively young democracy, but they serve to decentralize power and ensure the longevity of Africa\u2019s oldest liberation party beyond the ambitions of an individual leader.</p>\n<p>Yet, these internal machinations also leave voters feeling removed from a process that directly affects them. At the end of apartheid, as the ANC moved from liberation movement to political party, South African voters entrusted the party of Nelson Mandela with their freedom. In South Africa, politics at the dinner table\u2014and everywhere else\u2014is encouraged. Everyone has an opinion, from the seats of cramped minibus tax whizzing through the inner city, to the boardrooms of the country\u2019s richest square mile.</p>\n<p>The travesty of the Zuma years is that it has excluded ordinary South Africans from participating in their hard-won democracy. Zuma\u2019s ANC did not resemble a movement of the people and a <a href=\"https://qz.com/993986/scandal-after-scandal-but-south-africa-just-cant-get-rid-of-its-errant-president/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">series of corruption scandals</a> lead to a weakened economy and increasing poverty and desperation. Yet, his administration also inadvertently created the kind of public discourse where <a href=\"https://qz.com/887811/south-africans-are-the-biggest-borrowers-in-the-world-says-the-world-bank/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ordinary South Africans chat</a> about their country\u2019s sovereign credit rating.</p>\n<p>Ramaphosa has promised to turn this around, and bring back an ANC that serves the people. The real turning point, however, is for the South African public, with just over a year to the next election, to focus on demanding transparency and accountability and reclaim their democracy.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://qz.com/newsletters/africa-weekly-brief/\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief</a> &mdash; the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/aptopix-south-africa-elections.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/aptopix-south-africa-elections.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">APTOPIX South Africa Elections</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Facebook&#8217;s answer to Russian election meddling: postcards</title>\n\t\t<link>https://qz.com/1210286/facebooks-rob-goldman-and-the-postcard-solution-to-russian-election-meddling/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 22:22:24 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Anne Quito]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[\"America First\"]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[facebook]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Mueller trial]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Russia]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://qz.com/1210286//</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Facebook is turning to an antiquated technology to foil foreign interference in US elections.

Facebook and and its subsidiary Instagram were two of the primary tools used by the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency (IRA).</span></p>\n<p>The mailed postcards will contain special numeric codes, presumably to be entered online, to serve as as a kind of two-factor ID verification system. This would attempt to ensure that political ad buyers have a US address.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you run an ad mentioning a candidate, we are going to mail you a postcard and you will have to use that code to prove you are in the United States,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s far from clear how the system would work: Will the postcards be sent before or after the ads run? Wouldn&#8217;t it be better to transmit secret codes inside an envelope? The IRA deployed a sophisticated campaign ahead of the 2016 elections, including the use of US-based servers and operatives who physically traveled to the United States for reconnaissance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t solve everything,&#8221; Harbath admitted to Reuters.</p>\n<p>By law, <a href=\"https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/candidate-taking-receipts/who-can-and-cannot-contribute/\">only US citizens are allowed</a> to contribute to a political candidate&#8217;s campaign. The system is expected to be in place by November&#8217;s midterm congressional elections.</p>\n<p>Even as Harbath was speaking, Donald Trump was retweeting comments by another Facebook executive, Rob Goldman, who is the company&#8217;s vice president of ads.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-twitter\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"  data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The majority of the Russian ad spend happened AFTER the election.

Now, the National Labor Relations Board has found that <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/labor-board-found-google-was-within-its-rights-to-fire-1823086744\">Google was within its right</a> to fire engineer James Damore, author of an infamous diatribe titled &#8220;Google&#8217;s Ideological Echo Chamber.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Damore, among other claims, argued that women aren&#8217;t cut out to be engineers due to biological differences. Upon its July 2017 release, Google&#8217;s HR department received multiple complaints, and the memo was eventually leaked to the media. Damore filed a complaint with the NLRB after being fired a month later.</p>\n<p>NLRB attorney Jayme Sophir recommended in a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4380791-NLRB-Advice-Memo-On-James-Damore.html\">January 16 advice memo</a> that the labor board dismiss Damore&#8217;s complaint, which was withdrawn a week later. He is now suing the company in a separate lawsuit. Sophir cited Google&#8217;s carefully crafted talking points, which were read over the phone to Damore upon his termination.</p>\n<p>The company explicitly stated that discrimination was the issue, not Damore&#8217;s political beliefs or opinions. &#8220;Our decision is based solely on the part of your post that generalizes and advances stereotypes about women versus men,&#8221; one of the talking points notes. &#8220;This is not about you expressing yourself on political issues or having political views that are different than others at the company.

He suggests that Jollibee&#8217;s bestselling pasta is closer to egg noodles that Fujianese grandmothers would make. &#8220;Think pancit noodles with a mapo tofu sauce on top for a quick lunch or snack,&#8221; says Palanca, who writes a <a href=\"http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/byline/clinton-palanca/\">food column for the Philippine Daily Inquirer.</a> This taste would also have been appealing to Jollibee&#8217;s founder Tony Tan Caktiong, whose parents immigrated from Fujian to Manila.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1201955\" style=\"max-width: 950px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1201955 size-hero-l\" src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rts97em.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=940&strip=all\" alt=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"605\" srcset=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rts97em.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=940 940w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rts97em.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1880 1880w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rts97em.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300 300w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rts97em.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=700 700w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rts97em.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=768 768w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rts97em.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sweet tooth.</p></div>\n<p>Palanca says that the sugary sauce\u2014a very rough approximation of bolognese\u2014caters to the Asian preference for sweet foods. &#8220;The southeast Asian region in general uses sugar in their savory dishes to various extents, mainly because it\u2019s an area where sugar cane grows. This includes the coastal areas of China such as Fujian, whose cuisine is disparaged by the northern Chinese as being excessively sweet,&#8221; he explains.</p>\n<p>The Filipino spaghetti recipe is also peppered with ingredients from the American pantry, explains Palanca. &#8220;The addition of hotdogs is more likely due to our love of US military surplus canned goods\u2026&#8221;[It&#8217;s] a mashup of things that we Filipinos grew to love because of the war and the American bases: Banana ketchup was invented during the war years, as was the soft cheese that travelled well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So how will Jollibee&#8217;s sweet spaghetti fare with Italians?  &#8220;I think the Italians would be horrified,&#8221; says Palanca. &#8220;Our spaghetti is soft and meant to be eaten with a spoon and fork, rather than al dente and twirled around a fork\u2026I don\u2019t think you could sell this to Italians as spaghetti so much as an oriental snack that happens to have the same ingredients as spaghetti.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jollibee Milano, which has yet to confirm its opening date, is the first European outpost for Jollibee.

Contrary to other Netflix movies like <em>Bright</em> where fans vehemently disagreed with reviewers, audiences didn&#8217;t even care for it. Many were lukewarm\u2014with half on Rotten Tomatoes saying they enjoyed it.</p>\n<p>But they still tuned in. Five million people watched during an average minute in the first seven days the show was available, audience-measurement firm Nielsen found. Three million people watched on average in the first three days of the Sunday night release. By comparison, <em>Bright</em>, which cost Netflix more to produce and had a larger rollout, averaged <a href=\"https://qz.com/1168181/bright-had-11-million-viewers-in-its-opening-weekend-despite-getting-panned-by-critics/\">11 million viewers a minute</a> in its first three days, which started on a Friday night.</p>\n<p>Netflix had pretty much no marketing for <em>The Cloverfield Paradox</em> other than <a href=\"https://youtu.be/fJOQZmGsywE\">a Super Bowl commercial</a>, in which it announced the movie&#8217;s existence on Netflix and that it would hit the service immediately after the game ended. The price of a 30-second ad in this year&#8217;s game was <a href=\"https://qz.com/1192015/super-bowl-lii-how-the-price-of-an-ad-climbed-to-5-milion-in-2018/\">estimated at $5 million</a>\u2014that&#8217;s about $1 per viewer for a movie that otherwise could have been a total waste of time and money. The platform itself has been pushing the film heavily to its users\u2014it&#8217;s the first thing some people see when they sign onto the service.</p>\n<p>With subscription services like Netflix, there&#8217;s little downside in pressing play on a title you know nothing about. Worse comes to worse, you stop it midway through. The cost is baked into the platform, unlike with theatrical releases where audiences have real decisions to make on what is worth their hard-earned dollars.</p>\n<p>Had Paramount, the studio that made the movie along with J.J.

Set in the fictional and technologically-advanced nation of Wakanda, the country was never colonized and was largely hidden from the rest of the world. The movie\u2019s afro-futuristic elements also challenge on-screen racial and gender representation and <a href=\"https://qz.com/1209148/black-panthers-africa-afrofuturism-and-wakanda-are-stunning-reimagining-of-a-cultural-aesthetic/\">embrace a cinematic experience</a> where blackness and Africanness are equated with advancement, cybernetics, and sci-fi fantasy.</p>\n<p>For award-winning Kenyan photographer Osborne Macharia, <em>Black Panther</em> couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. Before the movie\u2019s launch in cinemas in London this week, he was commissioned by Marvel to create an \u201cexclusive art piece\u201d and given the creative license to experiment. Macharia is known for his composite photographs, in which he employs elements of history, science fiction, and digital photo editing to comment on historical narratives and social issues.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1210075\" style=\"max-width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-hero-m wp-image-1210075\" src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/a9cfcd62158499-5a86ce4aede82.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640&strip=all\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"853\" srcset=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/a9cfcd62158499-5a86ce4aede82.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640 640w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/a9cfcd62158499-5a86ce4aede82.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=225 225w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/a9cfcd62158499-5a86ce4aede82.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=525 525w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/a9cfcd62158499-5a86ce4aede82.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=768 768w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/a9cfcd62158499-5a86ce4aede82.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Leader was the wisest of all elders.</p></div>\n<p>In the past, he has produced photos of <a href=\"https://qz.com/815319/a-kenyan-artists-powerful-portraits-of-fictional-characters-honor-the-women-who-helped-end-british-rule-in-the-country/\">the Kipipiri women</a>, four brave warriors who undermined and help end British rule in Kenya.

In December, Trump tweeted that the agency&#8217;s reputation was &#8220;in tatters.&#8221; More recently, Trump and Wray were involved in a public spat over the much-disputed <a href=\"https://qz.com/1196870/full-transcript-of-the-gop-house-memo-by-devin-nunes/\">&#8220;Nunes memo,&#8221;</a> which suggested that the FBI had violated an American&#8217;s civil liberties.</p>\n<p>Wray has <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/scoop-sessions-fbi-trump-christopher-wray-877adb3e-5f8d-44a1-8a2f-d4f0894ca6a7.html\">reportedly threatened</a> to resign over attempts to oust his deputy Andrew McCabe. After repeated public attacks by Trump, McCabe <a href=\"https://qz.com/1191880/andrew-mccabe-steps-down-the-fbi-deputy-director-has-been-under-pressure-from-trump-for-months/\">himself resigned in January</a>.

While it would be politically toxic for Trump to fire Wray over Russia-related issues, the Florida screw-up could provide an alternative reason.</p>\n<p>Attorney general Jeff Sessions, who has come under sustained fire from the president for not protecting him from the investigation, has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/16/politics/parkland-shooting-fbi-tipster\">already called</a> for a review of Department of Justice and FBI processes.

For anyone who reads<a href=\"https://qz.com/1206918/credit-suisse-ceo-thiam-says-investors-were-warned-that-xiv-\"> the prospectus</a>, this was made clear: Credit Suisse said the \u201clong term expected value\u201d of its exchange-traded note was \u201czero.\u201d (It pays to read the fine print, after all.)</p>\n<p>Despite the carnage, this week investors came<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-15/vix-etp-investors-are-quick-to-forgive-turmoil-as-inflows-resume\"> back for more</a>, with net inflows to volatility-linked investments worth millions.</p>\n<p>If people keep piling into funds they don\u2019t understand, or rely on advisors without doing<a href=\"https://brokercheck.finra.org/\"> background checks</a>, then maybe it\u2019s time to let robots take over.

After struggling to keep his small public relations firm afloat for years, he decided to pack up his family and two dogs. Last year, Korenthal moved to McKinney, a conservative community in the outskirts of Dallas, Texas. By that point, he was a self-described Trump supporter.</p>\n<p>\u201cCalifornia is a lost cause now. I tell people \u2018Abandon ship. Go to Texas,\u2019\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Korenthal is part of a wave of Californians fleeing the Golden State\u2019s high cost of living, and more recently, the <a href=\"https://qz.com/1168530/on-jan-1-california-is-basically-becoming-a-different-state/\">increasingly liberal agenda</a> of its Democratic-dominated state government. Some California residents have proposed seceding from the state, to start \u201c<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/01/16/new-california-declares-independence-california-bid-become-51st-state/1036681001/\">New California.</a>&#8221; Others, like Korenthal, are simply leaving.</p>\n<p>Politically, the Lone Star state is the antithesis of California.<strong> </strong>It&#8217;s solidly Republican. Its state leaders are aggressively pro-business, anti-tax, anti-immigration, anti-abortion and pro-guns. And they like to point out the <a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/opinion/gov-abbott-overregulation-makes-texas-dream-california-nightmare/gFerS0BNhEGi4F6pWwNqZL/\">differences</a> between the two states every chance they get, furthering Texas\u2019s reputation as a bastion of conservatism.</p>\n<p>But conservatives fleeing California will find that, despite its right-wing bent, the Lone Star State is increasingly plagued with the same problems they are trying to leave behind. That&#8217;s because many of their pet peeves, from ballooning home prices to overstretched schools, have more to do with exuberant urban growth than politics.</p>\n<h2>Gone to Texas</h2>\n<p>California&#8217;s exodus is not new. Since the early 2000s, tens of thousands of Californians have been lured east by the \u201cTexas Miracle,\u201d an oil-fueled economic boom that propelled Texas to the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/01/the-texas-miracle/384818/\">top job creator</a> spot in the country. But even after collapsing oil prices <a href=\"https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2017/03/is-the-texas-economic-miracle-over/\">slowed down</a> the Texas economy, Californians kept coming.</p>\n<p>From 2010 to 2016, Texas took in the <a href=\"https://comptroller.texas.gov/economy/fiscal-notes/2017/october/migration.php\">biggest number</a> of domestic migrants of any state, adding 867,000 new residents. California, in contrast, was among the five biggest net losers; it hemorrhaged more than 380,000 residents. On average, nearly 60,000 Californians left their home for Texas every year from 2011 to 2015. The vast majority hailed from the state&#8217;s most heavily populated areas, in Southern California and in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>\n<p>Nine out of ten Californians who defected to Texas landed in a <a href=\"https://www.dshs.texas.gov/chs/hprc/counties.shtm\">metropolitan area</a>, according to our analysis of US census data from that period. And whether they intended it or not, most ended up in a more conservative place than the one they left.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-hero-m wp-image-1190726\" src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/flow2.png?w=640&#038;h=634\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"634\" srcset=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/flow2.png?w=640&amp;h=634 640w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/flow2.png?w=300&amp;h=297 300w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/flow2.png?w=700&amp;h=693 700w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/flow2.png?w=768&amp;h=760 768w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/flow2.png 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></p>\n<p>About half of the California transplants concentrated in the counties where Texas&#8217;s top five cities are located: Houston, San Antonio, Dallas, Austin, and Fort Worth.

The other half of California transplants settled in counties where Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1195724 size-hero-m\" src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/texas-map3.png?w=640&#038;h=521\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"521\" srcset=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/texas-map3.png?w=640&amp;h=521 640w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/texas-map3.png?w=300&amp;h=244 300w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/texas-map3.png?w=700&amp;h=570 700w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/texas-map3.png?w=768&amp;h=625 768w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/texas-map3.png 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></p>\n<p>The data doesn&#8217;t show whether the migration is politically-driven. Some California liberals likely ended up in conservative areas, and vice versa. But we do know that for at least some of the transplants, the move was ideological.</p>\n<h2>Conservative haven?</h2>\n<p>For Californians frustrated with their state&#8217;s liberal politics, the suburbs are the place to head to in Texas. They offer the affordable housing and access to well-paying jobs that Korenthal says have been stamped out by overregulation and high taxes in California.</p>\n<p>With the money he made from selling his California home, Korenthal was nearly able to pay cash for a bigger house in Texas. He found a job doing public relations for the American Fire Sprinkler Association, a Dallas-based trade group. Despite taking a pay cut, he says he lives better.</p>\n<p>The city has also been a political refuge. In McKinney, no one would berate Korenthal&#8217;s wife for sporting a sticker promoting a Republican presidential candidate on her car&#8217;s bumper, as she was in California. Here, the family can proudly hang, as they have, a door sign reading \u201cWe don\u2019t call 911\u201d decorated with a pair of crisscrossed guns.</p>\n<p>He has no plans of ever moving back to California. \u201cThat state needs to fail.

It was barely recognizable from the community he grew up in as a kid, he adds.</p>\n<p>Census data shows that San Bernardino has indeed changed. From 2000 to 2016, its population surged by 25%.

Over the past decade and a half, Collin, too, has grown poorer, less affordable and less Republican.</p>\n<p>Cultural norms are changing, too. Just a few years ago, no one gave a second thought to opening a school function in McKinney with a Christian prayer asking God for a second presidential term for George W.

(In a sign of the changing times, the superintendent acknowledged that it might make some in the audience uncomfortable\u2014though he went ahead with it anyway.) A few weeks ago, two <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/news/2018/01/19/mckinney-middle-school-teachers-resign-after-posting-anti-gay-anti-islamic-tweets\">district teachers had to step down</a> over tweets in which they called Islam \u201ca satanic death cult\u201d and said transgender people were mentally ill.</p>\n<div class=\"qz-table-container\">\n<table class=\"qz-table cf multi-column\">\n<thead class=\"qz-table-header cf\">\n<tr>\n<th>Collin</th>\n<th>2000</th>\n<th>2016</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"qz-table-row\">\n<td>Population</td>\n<td>491,675</td>\n<td>939,585</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"qz-table-row qz-table-row-alt\">\n<td>White (%)</td>\n<td>81</td>\n<td>58</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"qz-table-row\">\n<td>Black (%)</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"qz-table-row qz-table-row-alt\">\n<td>Asian (%)</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>14</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"qz-table-row\">\n<td>Hispanic (%)</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"qz-table-row qz-table-row-alt\">\n<td>Foreign born (%)</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"qz-table-row\">\n<td>Median household income</td>\n<td>$70,835</td>\n<td>$89,638</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"qz-table-row qz-table-row-alt\">\n<td>Poverty rate (%)</td>\n<td>4.9</td>\n<td>6.4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"qz-table-row\">\n<td>Owner occupied units (%)</td>\n<td>69</td>\n<td>67</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"qz-table-row qz-table-row-alt\">\n<td>Median value of owner-occupied units</td>\n<td>$155,500</td>\n<td>$288,100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"qz-table-row\">\n<td>Bachelor\u2019s degree or higher (%)</td>\n<td>47</td>\n<td>52</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"qz-table-row qz-table-row-alt\">\n<td>Vote for Republican presidential candidate</td>\n<td>73</td>\n<td>56</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h2>The Californization of Texas?</h2>\n<p>Areas neighboring Collins County seem even closer to Korenthal and Chabot&#8217;s dark picture of California.</p>\n<p>Just 30 miles away, Dallas County&#8217;s poverty rate is above 15%, just like in San Bernardino, California. Dallas County&#8217;s white population has been halved, to about 30%, since 2000\u2014just like in San Bernardino. And Trump supporters in Dallas County accounted for an even smaller share of the voting public than in San Bernardino during the last presidential election: 35% vs 42%.</p>\n<p>Korenthal blames the Democratic politics of cities such as Dallas for making parts of Texas look more like California. His theory is that over the long term, areas that embrace liberal policies will collapse under the weight of their own failure. Eventually places like Dallas\u2014and California\u2014 will come around to the Texas-style low-tax, light-regulation approach that generates economic prosperity for all sectors of society, he says.</p>\n<p>But despite Texas\u2019s stellar job creation and economic growth over the past decade and a half, the state\u2019s poverty rate inched up slightly\u2014to 15.7% in 2016 from 15.4% in 2000\u2014just like in California, where it rose from 14.2% to 14.4%.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Texas&#8217;s economic star has dimmed. The state&#8217;s economy shrank by 0.3% in 2016 vs. California&#8217;s 3.3% growth rate. (Data for the first three quarters of 2017 show Texas grew much faster than the previous year, and outpaced California.) As in California, the state&#8217;s population became less white and its voters less Republican than in 2000.</p>\n<p>Home prices across the state have also <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TXSTHPI\">climbed dramatically</a>. Texas is experiencing a <a href=\"https://www.recenter.tamu.edu/articles/technical-report/Texas-Housing-Insight\">housing crunch</a>, even though its land use regulations are among the <a href=\"https://www.freedominthe50states.org/land\">least restrictive</a> in the country and developers have <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/equity/2012/10/americas-truly-densest-metros/3450/\">more space</a> to build than in California. Incomes, however, have not kept pace. Here&#8217;s what that imbalance looks like in the Dallas metro area, which includes Collin County:</p>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"B1PT2TkLG\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"><img src=\"https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_B1PT2TkLG.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<p>There&#8217;s also evidence that <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/boom-time-in-texas-jobs-traffic-water-worries-1398737873\">the pressures</a> from a rapidly expanding and more diverse population have led to at least some of the more socially-minded policies adopted by Texas cities, not the other way around. In Houston, for example, local authorities had to pass <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/real-estate/article/2-years-after-court-ruling-Ashby-high-rise-7384486.php\">new rules</a> to avoid conflicts between existing homeowners and the wave of new developments spurred by its growing number of residents.</p>\n<p>Those new Texans are also weighing on public services, such as roads, schools and hospitals. Some of them, the undocumented immigrants who help underpin the Texas dream of <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2016/12/16/undocumented-workers-finding-jobs-underground-econ/\">affordable housing</a> through their cheap labor, are particularly dependent on those services because they tend to be poorer.</p>\n<p>Economists have been telling state politicians they have to cover those needs in order to keep the economy chugging. Even in the midst of the Texas Miracle, in 2013, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas <a href=\"https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economy/immigration.aspx\">underscored</a> the importance of this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Sustaining prosperity requires making public and private investments in education, English fluency, health care and infrastructure. While costly, such investments will help the state continue to attract the businesses and workers that have been central to its growth and transformation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Local officials at the front lines of the population bulge\u2014including some <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/news/politics/houston/article/Harris-County-Judge-Ed-Emmett-takes-aim-at-state-12388878.php\">Republicans</a>\u2014are now calling for more public spending.</p>\n<p>To be sure, Texas is far from becoming a liberal stronghold. The state government is sticking to its <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/per-capita-state-spending/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Per%20Capita%20State%20Spending%22,%22sort%22:%22desc%22%7D\">tight-fisted approach</a> to budgeting, and remains allergic to regulation. Gov. Greg Abbott just launched a crusade to <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2018/01/16/abbott-offers-plan-get-property-taxes-under-control/\">limit local taxes</a>.</p>\n<p>So, California refugees such as Korenthal and Chabot can rest assured that suburbs such as McKinney will remain conservative havens for years. Still, both men say, Texans shouldn&#8217;t become complacent about their conservatism. California, too, was once solidly red, they warn.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/fourth-of-july-parade-mckinney-texas-e1517001689462.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/fourth-of-july-parade-mckinney-texas-e1517001689462.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Parade, Young Spectators, Kids</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/flow2.png?w=640\" medium=\"image\" />\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/texas-map3.png?w=640\" medium=\"image\" />\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/california-transplant-in-texas-e1517500828521.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=640\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">california transplant in texas</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/paul-chabot-in-mckinney-texas-e1517003142575.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=320\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">paul chabot in mckinney texas</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/adriatic-village-mckinney-texas-e1517002950729.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=640\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Adriatic Village in McKinney, Texas</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>&#8220;Black Panther&#8221; elevates the entire Marvel universe</title>\n\t\t<link>https://quartzy.qz.com/1209627/black-panther-elevates-the-entire-marvel-universe/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 10:00:02 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Adam Epstein]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Africa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[African diaspora]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Black Panther]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[culture]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Entertainment]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[film]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[film industry]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[films]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[hollywood]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Marvel]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[marvel cinematic universe]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[marvel film]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Michael B.

Unlike many other fantasy worlds, Wakanda, the fictional African kingdom where the Marvel film takes place, can&#8217;t be separated from the narrative. Wakanda\u2014what it represents to different characters, what it is to outsiders, and what it should or shouldn&#8217;t be to the rest of the world\u2014<em>is </em>the story of <em>Black Panther</em>. And it&#8217;s a great one.</p>\n<p>An elaborate, mythic prologue\u2014not unlike the one that introduces Peter Jackson&#8217;s <em>The Lord of the Rings </em>trilogy, sets the stage: Hundreds of years ago, a meteorite carrying the fictional alien metal vibranium crashed in Africa. Several tribes waged war over the powerful resource before they were eventually united under one banner by the first Black Panther, a man who had found a mysterious herb that granted him superhuman abilities. Using the metal, Wakanda became the most technologically advanced country in the world. But out of fear that they&#8217;d be colonized and exploited like much of the rest of the continent, the Wakandans shut themselves off from the world and use their technology to make the nation appear as though it&#8217;s destitute\u2014thereby creating a hidden black oasis.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an utterly fascinating mythology upon which to build a superhero story. Based on the comic book superhero of the same name, <em>Black Panther</em> follows T&#8217;Challa&#8217;s (Chadwick Boseman) ascendancy to the Wakandan throne following the death of his father, T&#8217;Chaka, who previously assumed the ceremonial mantle of the Black Panther. Like his father, T&#8217;Challa believes that Wakanda should remain isolated out of self-preservation, but there&#8217;s a growing sentiment within the Wakandan ranks that the country should open itself up to the world and share its technology and tradition.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-video\" itemprop=\"video\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/VideoObject\"><meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"Ryan Coogler Breaks Down The Making Of &#039;Black Panther&#039;, Black Girl Power, &amp; Building Wakanda\" /><meta itemprop=\"description\" content=\"SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/HOT97Subscribe\n\nMore @ http://www.hot97.com \nor the HOT 97 App: http://bit.ly/HOT97APPWORLDWIDE\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/hot97\nTWITTER:    https://twitter.com/HOT97\nFACEBOOK:  https://www.facebook.com/HOT97OFFICIAL\" /><meta itemprop=\"uploadDate\" content=\"2018-02-14T18:15:59.000Z\" /><meta itemprop=\"thumbnailUrl\" content=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fRpunguFOq4/sddefault.jpg\" /><meta itemprop=\"duration\" content=\"PT46M1S\" /><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/fRpunguFOq4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></div>\n<p>The film really comes into its own when it introduces the villain: an American, Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) with a dark history and ties to Wakanda. Killmonger is by every measure the most interesting villain Marvel&#8217;s cinematic universe has ever offered. In fact, he&#8217;s only a &#8220;villain&#8221; insofar as his philosophy directly challenges that of our hero, the Black Panther. In large part due to a hugely committed performance by Jordan, Killmonger is a genuinely thrilling on-screen presence.</p>\n<p>More than thrills, though, Killmonger inserts a profound moral dilemma into the heart of <em>Black Panther</em>, one steeped in racial history and identity that&#8217;s deeply personal to a large segment of the film&#8217;s audience. Killmonger\u2014an Oakland, California native with special ops experience and a lifetime of righteous anger\u2014advances a very different vision for Wakanda&#8217;s future from T&#8217;Challa&#8217;s. He wants to use the country&#8217;s massive vibranium reserves to arm black communities around the world so they can revolt against their oppressors. He wants a new world where he, and people who look like him, are finally in control of their destinies after centuries of subjugation.</p>\n<p>If this doesn&#8217;t sound like an ordinary Marvel superhero film, that&#8217;s because it decidedly is not. It&#8217;s a testament to director Ryan Coogler&#8217;s vision that <em>Black Panther </em>is a wholly unique, self-sufficient film that still manages to fit snugly into the wider Marvel ecosystem. Marvel needs <em>Black Panther </em>much more than <em>Black Panther </em>needs Marvel, a set-up that is in some ways mirrored by the story. Does the world need Wakanda? Does the African diaspora need Wakanda? Or should Wakanda remain in defensive camouflage?</p>\n<p>Coogler has created something original and vital out of a Disney-fied superhero universe that, for the most part, has operated at the same worn out wavelength for a decade. That&#8217;s a huge feat unto itself. <em>Black Panther </em>doesn&#8217;t &#8220;transcend&#8221; the superhero genre so much as it elevates the entire thing alongside it.

The Balearic government wants to change all that, making the popular Mediterranean holiday destination into a beacon of sustainable tourism.</p>\n<p>\u201cWith this law we want to make what\u2019s often our biggest challenge\u2014our nature as islands\u2014into an opportunity,\u201d said Joan Groizard, energy director in the regional government. \u201cMoving to 100% clean energy and mobility should be easier here than on the continent, so it\u2019s our responsibility to get working on that head start.\u201d</p>\n<p>There is a majority in favor of a transition to clean energy in the Balearic parliament, Groizard told Climate Home News, including some members of the opposition. But expansion of wind and solar power so far has been held up by local objections to the visual impact. And the region is on a collision course with Madrid, where the energy ministry has <a href=\"http://www.elmundo.es/baleares/2017/11/13/5a09a109ca47416a538b45f5.html\">rejected</a> a key element of the plan: closure of the Es Murterar coal power station by 2025.</p>\n<p>Their disagreement <a href=\"http://www.diariodemallorca.es/mallorca/2017/11/15/madrid-dijo-govern-cerrar-murterar/1263965.html\">centers on the projected costs of the transition</a>. In the short term, more expensive gas is expected to plug the gap left by taking coal offline. Existing gas plants have the capacity to increase output. There are also costs associated with keeping Es Murterar open. Two of the plant\u2019s four units would require upgrades to stay open beyond 2020, under EU pollution rules, at an estimated \u20ac100m.</p>\n<p>Central energy minister Daniel Davila <a href=\"http://www.diariodemallorca.es/mallorca/2017/11/14/madrid-niega-cerrar-central-murterar/1263754.html\">has claimed</a> the transition would cost \u20ac200 million ($250 million), while Palma\u2019s Marc Pons said it would be \u20ac10m ($12 million) at most. A spokesperson for Spain\u2019s energy ministry said they were waiting to see the specifics of the Balearic proposal, but it would need to align with national policy.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the Balearics, the difference in the cost of energy production is subsidized and included in the electricity bill of all the Spanish citizens,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cTherefore, the different Spanish administrations have to reach a consensus regarding the energy policy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pons and Groizard are set to meet EU climate commissioner Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete on Feb. 20 to appeal for support. Ca\u00f1ete is a member of Spain\u2019s ruling Partido Popular (People\u2019s Party) and was instrumental in negotiating the Paris Agreement on climate change.</p>\n<p>If unresolved, the dispute may go to the constitutional court, the fate of parts of <a href=\"http://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/consejodeministros/referencias/Paginas/2017/refc20171103.aspx\">Catalonia\u2019s regional climate law</a>.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is infuriating and hard to understand why Madrid is blocking the aim of the Balearic Islands to switch to clean energy,\u201d said Sarah Oppenheimer, a campaigner who moved to Mallorca recently with her Spanish partner and children.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt seems so obvious that a place so abundant in sunshine should take advantage of its resources and reap the benefits of cleaner air, more local employment, and reduced emissions, especially now that solar energy is so competitive and often cheaper than fossil fuels.\u201d</p>\n<p>Key points of the draft climate law include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interim renewable electricity targets of 10% of supply by 2020 and 35% by 2030</li>\n<li>Requirements for new large buildings and car parks to include solar panels</li>\n<li>Progressive targets for the car hire industry towards a 100% electric fleet by 2035</li>\n<li>Rights for people to invest in renewable energy projects in their community</li>\n<li>Rules for businesses to measure their carbon footprints and bring in sectoral emissions reduction targets</li>\n<li>A framework to update the regional climate plan every five years, overseen by an independent committee</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It takes inspiration from Denmark and Germany on community ownership of renewables, which can boost local support, and the UK on governance arrangements to lock in action over the long term.</p>\n<p>Spain is <a href=\"https://www.energia16.com/spain-prepare-draft-bill-climate-change-law/?lang=en\">expected</a> to publish a long-awaited national draft climate law in the coming weeks. The government spokesperson said it had an \u201cambitious policy\u201d on renewable energy and would meet its commitments to the Paris Agreement.</p>\n<p><em>This article originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.climatechangenews.com/2018/02/15/ibiza-mallorca-launch-100-renewable-power-plan-defying-madrid/\">Climate Home News</a>. </em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Learn how to </i><a href=\"https://qz.com/635686/the-complete-guide-to-writing-for-quartz-ideas/\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>write for Quartz Ideas</i></span></a><i>.

That and other shady online activity led Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating foreign interference in the election, to <a href=\"https://qz.com/1209619/russian-election-interference-read-the-full-text-of-robert-muellers-indictment-of-13-russian-nationals/\">indict</a> 13 Russian nationals.</p>\n<p>Before the campaign though, these fake accounts eased into their digital personas by tweeting stereotypically &#8220;American&#8221; content: Nirvana lyrics, Bible verses, uplifting platitudes, comments about pizza.</p>\n<p>This transition in tone from vapid to vociferously political is common across the universe of Russian troll tweets, according to our survey of 200,000 tweets released this week <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/now-available-more-200-000-deleted-russian-troll-tweets-n844731\">by NBC</a>. The banal early tweets could be part of an effort to make the accounts seem like they belong to real people.</p>\n<p>A good example is the Twitter user &#8220;evagreen69,&#8221; now known to be part of the network of Russian accounts. In July 2014, it tweeted, &#8220;I am in Love with LOVE!&#8221; A few months later, the user announced, &#8220;Oh, that I had wings like a dove!&#8221;\u2014chapter 55, <a href=\"http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-6.htm\">verse 6</a> of the Book of Psalms. The next month there was a quote from the Stoic philosopher Seneca: &#8220;The most onerous slavery is to be a slave to oneself.&#8221; In the same month it tweeted, &#8220;What I tend to do when it comes to you,&#8221; a <a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shakira/cantremembertoforgetyou.html\">line</a> from a song by Shakira (feat. Rihanna).</p>\n<p>None of the quotes were attributed.</p>\n<p>Then, in 2015, evagreen69 started to get political. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a secret that Obama grew up in a Muslim family,&#8221; it claimed in February of that year. In March, &#8220;All of those protesters in Ferguson, your hand [sic] are covered with blood!&#8221; Later in the year, &#8220;#GOPDebate Together we can make America great again.&#8221; Much later, in August 2016: &#8220;Please sign and share my petition #WakeUpAmerica #NeverHillary #ImNotWithHer.&#8221; That one was retweeted over 800 times.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Eva Green&#8217;s&#8221; initial penchant for song lyrics, scripture, and inspirational quotes is shared across the troll network.</p>\n<p>In 2014, the user &#8220;heyits_toby&#8221; had a Benjamin Franklin quote, a line from a song by the Finnish rock band Rasmus, and an English translation of a Russian proverb. The account &#8220;patriotraphael,&#8221; delivered yet another Seneca quote, yet another Russian proverb, and this line from the rap-rock band Hollywood Undead: &#8220;I got the speakers pumpin&#8217; straight bangin&#8217; the thong song #RAPCORE.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at another example. Why not. Twitter user &#8220;judelambertusa&#8221; had these three quotes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>&#8220;The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.&#8221; \u2014Ludwig Wittgenstein</li>\n<li>&#8220;A happy marriage is the union of two good forgivers.&#8221; \u2014Ruth Bell Graham</li>\n<li>&#8220;Know that I don&#8217;t make music for niggas who don&#8217;t get pussy so those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me.&#8221; \u2014Drake (this one was attributed)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There is much more like this.</p>\n<p>From the 200,000 tweets collected by NBC, the pattern looks like this: A new troll account is set up. It populates its feed with non-political tweets, presumably drawing from databases of quotes, song lyrics, platitudes, and, it seems, Russian proverbs. Then the account gets going with political messages. Those messages lean pro-Trump, but they can go <a href=\"https://qz.com/1207518\">the other way</a>, too.</p>\n<p>The goal here seems to be to make the accounts look like those of regular Americans. If they only tweeted controversial political messages, it would be more obvious that they were not genuine. That&#8217;s also probably why they have names like &#8220;patriotraphael&#8221; and &#8220;judelambertusa.&#8221; In his indictment, Mueller accused the Russian propagandists of impersonating Americans on social media.</p>\n<p>The Russian trolls seem to have a sense of humor. There is some irony in turning a Benjamin Franklin quote into a weapon aimed at the United States. But Lil&#8217; Wayne (yes, he&#8217;s in there) just seems sloppy. Perhaps they were taking the advice of Steven Tyler, via the troll user &#8220;micparrish&#8221;: &#8220;If it is worth doing, it is worth overdoing.&#8221;</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/russian-trolls-e1518818654487.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/russian-trolls-e1518818654487.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Snigers, who play the part of Trolls, perform during a dress rehearsal of Sergei Banevich&#039;s opera &#34;The Story of Kai and Gerda&#34; at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Paypal was used to launder Russian trolls&#8217; money during the 2016 election</title>\n\t\t<link>https://qz.com/1209842/russian-election-interference-paypal-pypl-was-used-by-russians-to-launder-money/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 22:10:20 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Max de Haldevang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[money-laundering]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[PayPal]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[richard pinedo]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Robert Mueller]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Russian trolls]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Trump Russia]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://qz.com/1209842//</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Russian trolls used Paypal to sow chaos in the 2016 US election, according to special counsel Robert Mueller&#8217;s indictment today of 13 Russian nationals.

The state-run Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-politics-emergency/ethiopia-declares-state-of-emergency-idUSKCN1G01Z3\">said</a> the council \u201ccame to the conclusion that imposing emergency rule would be vital to safeguarding the constitutional order of our country.\u201d It was not immediately clear when the measure would be effective or for how long it will last.</p>\n<p>The directive comes at a tipping point for the Horn of Africa nation, which has experienced increasing violence and internal political problems for more than two years now. The Oromos and the Amharas, the country\u2019s two largest ethnic groups, have been agitating for more political inclusion, economic equality, and social justice. The minority Tigray community <a href=\"https://qz.com/822258/ethiopias-ordinary-tigray-minority-is-caught-in-the-middle-of-oromo-protests/\">dominates the ruling coalition</a> and opposition complain they enjoy disproportionate influence and representation in government.</p>\n<p>The government crackdown had turned fatal, with more than 1,000 people dead and tens of thousands put behind bars, according to advocacy groups. From Oct. 2016 to Aug. 2017, authorities also <a href=\"https://qz.com/1046490/oromo-protests-ethiopia-votes-to-lift-state-of-emergency-rule-imposed-after-oromo-amhara-protests/\">imposed an emergency rule</a> following deadly protests.</p>\n<p>A spate of violence has also ensued between the Oromos and the ethnic Somalis recently, showcasing <a href=\"https://qz.com/1160398/ethiopias-oromos-and-somalis-clash-again-leaving-61-dead/\">the governance troubles</a> facing the Tigray-led ruling Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) party. In early December, when a crackdown on protests in villages in Oromia led to more killings and demonstrations, the government also <a href=\"https://qz.com/1157890/oromo-protests-ethiopia-has-blocked-social-media-sites-facebook-twitter-and-youtube/\">blocked the internet</a>.</p>\n<p>Desalegn <a href=\"https://qz.com/1208281/ethiopias-prime-minister-hailemariam-desalegn-has-resigned/\">resigned</a> amidst all this, but not before he <a href=\"https://qz.com/1171312/ethiopia-will-free-political-prisoners-close-maekelawi-detention-centre/\">oversaw the release</a> of more than 6,000 political prisoners and journalists since early January. The 52-year-old took these steps, he said, in a bid to foster national consensus, open up political dialogue, and widen the democratic space.</p>\n<p>Hours after his resignation, opposition officials and critics abroad started calling for the Ethiopian system of governance to be overhauled. Mulatu Gemechu, deputy secretary of the opposition Oromo Federalist Congress <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ethiopia-politics/ethiopia-government-has-lost-authority-all-parties-must-help-guide-reforms-opposition-idUKKCN1G01LY?il=0\">told Reuters</a> that EPRDF had lost its authority, and that \u201cEthiopians now need a government that respects their rights, not one that keeps beating and killing them.\u201d</p>\n<p>And even though the council of ministers has <a href=\"http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/et/et007en.pdf#page=35\">the power to decree</a> an emergency state under the constitution, it still wasn\u2019t known what this meant for the country\u2019s future. Mohammed Ademo, the editor of the OPride, a website that reports on the Oromo diaspora and advocates for social justice in Ethiopia, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OPride/status/964550663345713152\">wrote on Twitter</a> that the command seemed to be \u201can outcome of a succession struggle gone awry\u201d and \u201cbodes ill for the country\u2019s future. It will hinder the promised reform efforts.\u201d</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://qz.com/newsletters/africa-weekly-brief/\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief</a> &mdash; the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rts1eneq-e1518813411793.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rts1eneq-e1518813411793.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">A demonstrator chants slogans while flashing the Oromo protest gesture during celebrations for Irreecha, the thanksgiving festival of the Oromo people, in Bishoftu town, Oromia region</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Russian trolls convinced an American to hold a &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; sign for their oligarch boss</title>\n\t\t<link>https://qz.com/1209779/muellers-latest-indictment-on-russian-election-interference-has-a-strange-happy-birthday-anecdote-about-prigozhin/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 20:48:23 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Max de Haldevang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[\"America First\"]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[evgeny prigozhin]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Robert Mueller]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Russian trolls]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Trump Russia]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[yevgeny prigozhin]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://qz.com/1209779//</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[One of the overarching questions about Russia&#8217;s online campaign to destabilize the US election is just how effective those social media efforts really were.

The film, released today, is poised to bring home<a href=\"http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/black-panther-racing-toward-180-million-opening\"> $180 million this weekend</a>. According to the movie tickets site Fandango, it has <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/adriennegibbs/2018/02/15/why-is-black-panther-selling-out-activists-churches-schools-buy-1000s-of-tickets/#2e157e6fdbb0\">pre-sold more tickets</a> than any other superhero movie. The buzz seems justified: Movie critics are calling it <a href=\"http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2018/01/critics-calling-black-panther-best-marvel-movies\">&#8220;incredible, kinetic, purposeful&#8221;</a> and &#8220;as touching as it is thrilling.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To many, <em>Black Panther</em> is more than a movie. It&#8217;s a cultural phenomenon, a necessary and joyous tribute to being black\u2014not just in America, but in <a href=\"https://quartzy.qz.com/1196551/black-panther-is-more-than-a-film-it-carries-the-hopes-of-the-global-african-diaspora/\">the global African diaspora</a>. Celebrities are buying out theaters in underserved neighborhoods so black children can see faces like their own onscreen. Nigerians, Kenyans, and Ghanaians are<a href=\"https://www.essence.com/fashion/why-im-dressing-see-black-panther\"> sporting traditional garb</a> to see the movie.</p>\n<p>Many non-black people are also eager to share in this worldwide celebration. But it&#8217;s easy to feel nervous about how to engage in and respectfully support the identity-focused wave of elation. The answer is clearly not to mute that excitement. But know this: If you&#8217;re white, this is one time that you won&#8217;t see someone who looks like you onscreen fighting villains, commanding power, or saving innocent people. And that&#8217;s precisely why you should go see this film.</p>\n<h2>The power of (not) seeing yourself onscreen</h2>\n<p>White people are very used to seeing themselves onscreen. <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/hollywood-movies-are-still-very-white-straight-and-male-study-says\">A study</a> from the University of Southern California examined 800 movies that came out between 2007 and 2015, and found that of 32,205 characters, just a quarter were non-white. The lack of representation is even more stark behind the camera: Just 5.5% of the directors were black, for example.</p>\n<p><em>Black Panther </em>has an almost entirely black cast and a black director. That&#8217;s a gift for black girls and boys everywhere who aren&#8217;t used to seeing themselves onscreen\u2014and it&#8217;s a gift for non-black people, too. Fictional storytelling offers a unique opportunity for empathy, says Jennifer Barnes, a professor of psychology at the University of Oklahoma.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fiction offers us front-row access to other people&#8217;s minds,&#8221; she explains. &#8220;It lets us see how emotions, and relationships, and other people&#8217;s beliefs are playing out in these complicated social situations.&#8221; That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s crucial to seek out stories that don&#8217;t mirror your own life and identity.</p>\n<p>This might be even more important for non-black children. As <em>Black Panther</em> costumes hit the shelves, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/style/black-panther-children-costumes.html\">nervous parents are agonizing</a> (paywall) over whether to encourage their non-black children to dress up as the King of Wakanda.</p>\n<p>In short, they should. Children today will hopefully be able to look up to many more black and brown heroes as they grow up\u2014just as kids of all races and genders have long played out their childhood superhero fantasies as white males such as Superman and Batman.</p>\n<p>And don&#8217;t feel inhibited from discussing Black Panther&#8217;s race. Children develop a sense of race early on, and can have subconscious associations with certain races by the time they enter primary school\u2014so avoiding the topic in the hope that race never becomes &#8220;an issue&#8221; is not particularly effective, <a href=\"https://qz.com/821200/if-youre-not-talking-about-race-with-your-kid-youre-likely-teaching-her-to-be-racist/\">experts say</a>. Instead, actively encouraging children&#8217;s admiration for a person of a different race or identity group, <a href=\"https://qz.com/1110802/moana-halloween-costume-please-dont-tell-your-kids-they-cant-dress-as-moana-this-halloween/\">in a respectful way</a>, helps them to thoughtfully respond to and empathize with others.</p>\n<p>Taking them to see <em>Black Panther</em>, and talking openly about why it&#8217;s an inspiring milestone, is a great first step.</p>\n<h2>The power of an alternative story</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth remembering that, as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/editorial/tldr-white-people-need-black-panther-as-much-as-black-people-do/2018/02/15/1f85cd76-11e4-11e8-a68c-e9374188170e_video.html?utm_term=.4a29025406ff\">Karen Attiah</a>, an editor at the Washington Post says, &#8220;In 2018, we live in a world where white fantasies about black inferiority still rage.&#8221; <em>Black Panther</em> combats those persistent and pernicious fantasies with a new and inspiring story.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s one that straddles reality and fantasy. Wakanda may be fictional, but its inhabitants speak <a href=\"https://qz.com/1192662/black-panther-wakandas-language-is-isixhosa-of-south-africa/\">a real African language</a>. There&#8217;s &#8220;Okavango triangular, ancient, sacred geometry from Africa&#8221; all over Black Panther&#8217;s suit, Ruth E. Carter, who designed the film&#8217;s costumes, <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/movies/2018/2/15/17012262/black-panther-costume-design-ruth-e-carter-interview-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan\">told The Ringer</a>. The female fighting force have Masai beading, South African leatherwork, and hand-tooled jewelry armor.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile Wakanda, rendered as a kind of Afro-futurist utopia, is high-tech, covered in the rich mineral Vibranium, and wealthy beyond measure\u2014a place that doesn&#8217;t exist, but asks the important and provocative question, &#8220;what if?&#8221; It&#8217;s important that black and non-black people take this imaginative trip, and explore how a culture&#8217;s heroism, power, and technological prowess could have played out in the absence of colonialism and oppression.</p>\n<p>Of course, the film likely won&#8217;t get everything right. Worries about cultural appropriation and African caricaturing <a href=\"https://qz.com/1003692/marvels-black-panther-and-wakanda-raises-questions-about-african-cultural-appropriation/\">have been cropping up since details</a> about the movie first began leaking out. But participating in this moment, as a non-black person, is a useful thought experiment, and offers a glimpse of a tantalizing alternate reality.</p>\n<h2>The power of your money</h2>\n<p><em>Black Panther</em> follows the first black-led film <a href=\"https://nerdist.com/why-black-panther-will-be-commercial-success-essay/\">to make $100 million</a> in the US, <em>Girls Trip</em>. It follows <em>Get Out, </em>which stared down the discomfort of being black in America, while grossing 40 times its production budget. And it follows <em>Moonlight</em>, the story of a gay, black American&#8217;s coming of age, which won the best picture Oscar in 2017.</p>\n<p><em>Black Panther</em> is no sleeper hit or low-budget art movie. \u201cI hope you can tell from watching the movie, but the resources devoted to this movie are equal to and in fact surpass our last couple of movies,\u201d Kevin Feige, the head of Marvel Studios, <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2018/02/why-marvel-spent-more-on-the-black-panther-budget.html\">told Vulture</a>. It&#8217;s true. The studio spent $200 million bringing Wakanda and its characters to life.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Hollywood remains so very white. That&#8217;s despite huge box office potential among black audiences. African Americans, on average, visit theaters <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bet-networks-demystifies-the-psychology-of-black-movie-goers-with-new-report-reel-facts-a-movie-goer-consumption-study-122495808.html\">13.4 times a year</a>, compared to the 11 visits made by the average American. With movies such as <em>Selma</em> and <em>Top Five</em>, Hollywood has learned that black people will support a story that centers black characters. What&#8217;s important now is that the industry learns that people of other races can identify and engage with\u2014and be entertained by\u2014a story with strong black characters too.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot riding on <em>Black Panther</em>. So go see it. Buy a ticket for yourself, for your friends, for your lover, for your neighbor. Then talk about it, chew on it\u2014enjoy it. And go see it again.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/blackpanther_image.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/blackpanther_image.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">BlackPanther_image</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Read Robert Mueller&#8217;s indictment of 13 Russians for election interference</title>\n\t\t<link>https://qz.com/1209619/russian-election-interference-read-the-full-text-of-robert-muellers-indictment-of-13-russian-nationals/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 18:38:44 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Tim Fernholz]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[\"America First\"]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[collusion]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[conspiracy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Election]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[election 2016]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[facebook]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[fraud]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[intelligence]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Internet]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[politics]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[post]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Robert Mueller]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Russia]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[social media]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[US election]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://qz.com/1209619//</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The special counsel investigating foreign interference in the 2016 US presidential election has accused 13 Russian nationals and several related organizations with committing fraud to&#8230;]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/russia-indictment-bob-mueller-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-investigation.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"U.S. President Donald Trump, center right, and Russia&#039;s President Vladimir Putin, center left, talk during the family photo session at the APEC Summit in Danang, Saturday, Nov. 11, 2017.\" srcset=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/russia-indictment-bob-mueller-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-investigation.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024 1024w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/russia-indictment-bob-mueller-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-investigation.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=2048 2048w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/russia-indictment-bob-mueller-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-investigation.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300 300w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/russia-indictment-bob-mueller-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-investigation.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=700 700w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/russia-indictment-bob-mueller-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-investigation.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=768 768w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/russia-indictment-bob-mueller-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-investigation.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p>The special counsel investigating foreign interference in the 2016 US presidential election has accused 13 Russian nationals and several related organizations with committing fraud to support Donald Trump&#8217;s presidential campaign and sabotage his rival, Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p>The indictment below was issued today. It is unlikely to result in extradition of the individuals from Russia, but the document could lay the groundwork for charges against Americans for aiding and abetting their work, though no Americans are implicated in this document.</p>\n<p>Its charges also provide new evidence for claims by US intelligence agencies that Russia attempted to manipulate US voters in 2016. Though it does not weigh in on how much the Russian propaganda effort altered the election, it says the messages reached &#8220;significant numbers of Americans.&#8221; The Internet Research Agency, the organization at the heart of the indictment, has been connected for years to internet security breaches <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html\">on behalf of the Russian government</a>.</p>\n<p>The individuals named in the document stole US identities and created false online presences to spread political propaganda, even hosting their own rallies. One Twitter handle impersonating Tennessee&#8217;s Republican party attracted more than 100,000 followers. An internal message instructed the operators to &#8220;use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump\u2014we support them).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Read the entire indictment

And (surprise, surprise) many of them aren&#8217;t reacting so well.</p>\n<p>Surely, if you&#8217;re a man, watching other men lose their power can be scary. Maybe you didn&#8217;t <a href=\"https://qz.com/1099864/why-wasnt-harvey-weinstein-fired-for-sexual-harassment-until-now/\">masturbate in front of her</a>, or use a <a href=\"https://work.qz.com/1142050/matt-lauer-allegedly-locked-women-in-his-office-with-a-button-under-his-desk/\">secret button to trap her</a> in your office, but did you stare too long? Did that compliment come off too strong? Contemplating these questions is necessary and, most women will tell you, perfectly okay.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s not necessary, or remotely okay? Reacting to #MeToo by isolating yourself from the women you work with\u2014an inclination which has become all too common, according to a <a href=\"https://leanin.org/mentor-her/\">new study</a> conducted by the Sheryl Sandberg-founded women&#8217;s empowerment nonprofit LeanIn.Org and Survey Monkey.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the aftermath of <a class=\"_58cn\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/metoo?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=10159854933800177\"><span class=\"_5afx\"><span class=\"_58cl _5afz\">#</span><span class=\"_58cm\">MeToo</span></span></a>, as several powerful men have lost their jobs (good!) for harassing women, some men have chosen to react by adopting what\u2019s called the Mike Pence rule \u2013 never having dinner alone with a woman other than your wife,&#8221; Sandberg wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sheryl/posts/10159854933800177?pnref=story\">recent post</a> on Facebook, where she is COO. &#8220;If men think that the way to address workplace sexual harassment is to avoid one-on-one time with female colleagues \u2013 including meetings, coffee breaks, and all the interactions that help us work together effectively \u2013 it will be a huge setback for women.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Countless <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2014/04/22/305814367/evidence-of-racial-gender-biases-found-in-faculty-mentoring\">studies</a> have shown that white men are more likely to receive mentorship than women, people of color, and <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0018726706068783\">gay men</a>\u2014a pattern that clearly predates #MeToo. They&#8217;ve also been more successful in finding mentors with more organizational clout, as <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2010/09/why-men-still-get-more-promotions-than-women\">this article in Harvard Business Review</a> noted back in 2010. But the backlash to #MeToo threatens to make the playing field more uneven still.</p>\n<p>LeanIn.Org and SurveyMonkey investigated the impact of #MeToo in the workplace by polling a nationally representative sample of nearly 9,000 adults employed in the US, via two online surveys.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://leanin.org/sexual-harassment-backlash-survey-results/#key-finding-1\">results were alarming</a>: According to the surveys, nearly 50% of male managers across industries say they&#8217;re now uncomfortable participating in one or more common work activities with women, like working together one-on-one or socializing together. And the percentage of male managers who say they&#8217;re uncomfortable mentoring women has risen from 5% to 16%\u2014meaning one in six male managers is uncomfortable mentoring a female colleague.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s more, senior men\u2014those who typically have the most power to sponsor and promote junior employees\u2014said they are 3.5 times more likely to hesitate to have a work dinner with a junior woman than a junior man, and five times more likely to hesitate to travel for work with a junior woman.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The last thing women need right now is even more isolation,&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sheryl/posts/10159854933800177?pnref=story\">Sandberg wrote</a> in response to the findings. &#8220;Men vastly outnumber women as managers and senior leaders, so when they avoid, ice out, or exclude women, we pay the price.&#8221;</p>\n<p>LeanIn.org has launched a new campaign in response called <a href=\"https://leanin.org/mentor-her/\">#MentorHer,</a> to encourage executives to publicly promise to mentor women and foster female leadership talent. Among those to make the commitment thus far: <span lang=\"EN\">Oath CEO Tim Armstrong, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey, Disney CEO Bob Iger, and more. The roster also includes several female executives, such as GM CEO Mary Barra and Hearst chief content officer Joanna Coles.</span></p>\n<div class=\"embed-twitter\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"  data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Some of the best advice I received was from male mentors who encouraged me to speak up in meetings and to take leadership roles. I commit to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MentorHer?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MentorHer</a> and encourage my team to do the same. Learn more: <a href=\"https://t.co/EdFDolwaFQ\">https://t.co/EdFDolwaFQ</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Mary Barra (@mtbarra) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mtbarra/status/960905591593062401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 6, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>The #MentorHer campaign could perhaps be viewed as a form of mentorship itself, for executives who feel wary now about their working relationships with women. Sandberg&#8217;s advice? &#8220;Men who want to be on the right side of this issue shouldn\u2019t avoid women. They should mentor them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As for the men who still don&#8217;t feel comfortable dining alone with a female colleague, Sandberg says, &#8220;Fine. But make access equal: no dinners alone with anyone. Breakfast or lunches for all. Or group dinners only, nothing one-on-one. Whatever you choose, treat women and men equally.&#8221;</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/sandy-e1518799332262.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/sandy-e1518799332262.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Facebook&#039;s COO Sandberg addresses Facebook Gather conference in Brussels</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>A noted list of the best companies to work for put a new premium on minority experiences</title>\n\t\t<link>https://work.qz.com/1209433/fortunes-100-best-companies-list-put-a-new-premium-on-minority-experiences/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 18:32:50 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Lila MacLellan]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Identity &amp; Inclusion]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[best companies]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Business]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[company culture]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[diversity]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[employee satisfaction]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[employee surveys]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Fortune magazine]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Google]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[great place to work]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[inclusiveness]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Jobs]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[management]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Salesforce]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[work]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://qz.com/1209433//</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Say what you will about the value of lists like Fortune magazine\u2019s Best Companies To Work For.

The ranking of 100 top companies has been an annual tradition for two decades. It\u2019s also the showpiece product of the magazine\u2019s longtime research partner, Great Place to Work, a consulting and research firm.</p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s something different about this year&#8217;s list, which was based on responses from more than 300,000 employees at large companies that opted into the survey. A change in methodology this year put greater emphasis on feedback from survey respondents who self-identified as women, minorities, or LGBTQ. It is the first time, says Michael Bush, the CEO of Great Place to Work, that the list reflects what he has dubbed a \u201cGreat Places to Work <em>For All</em>\u201d mindset.</p>\n<p>That may sound like a no-brainer in today\u2019s corporate culture. Diversity recruiting and inclusion efforts have become so critical to big companies that<a href=\"https://work.qz.com/1207367/ibm-is-suing-its-former-chief-diversity-officer-for-taking-the-same-job-at-microsoft/\"> IBM is suing its former chief diversity officer </a>for taking the same job at Microsoft, on the concern that she might spill secrets about her former employer&#8217;s approach to cultivating a more diverse workforce. But a few years ago, when Bush started talking about the need for a new approach, it was a much tougher sell.</p>\n<p>Human resources executives were aware that minority groups were not having a great experience at some of the top-rated companies\u2014something Bush, too, had detected in the data when he took over as Great Place to Work&#8217;s CEO in 2015. But when he explained his proposal to other CEOs for changing up the methodology, they were frightened by it.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>For the first time in its history, the company wanted to add new categories to its audit that would measure how consistently different groups found the company a great place to work, and whether they felt the company lived up to its stated values.</p>\n<p>\u201cI said, &#8216;We\u2019re looking at the disparity between one group and another,&#8217; and that hit every alarm bell they have. All of them knew they had a problem, because that\u2019s America,&#8221; Bush says. He says he could see the executives felt caught, thinking to themselves, \u201cIf I don\u2019t apply [to be included on the list], it will look like I\u2019m afraid. If I do apply, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll do well.\u201d Some multinational firms said they weren&#8217;t sure they&#8217;d continue.</p>\n<p>Worried he had made \u201cthe record-setting mistake of my career,\u201d Bush, who served on former US president Barack Obama\u2019s White House Business Council, says he wondered how he had not factored fear of exposure into his roll-out. He thought he may have destroyed his firm.</p>\n<p>But stumbling through those conversations, he says, he was able to reframe his project in ways that made sense to CEOs. The wording needed tweaking, essentially.</p>\n<p>His clients could see that a \u201cfor all\u201d commitment would mean the firm was \u201cmaximizing the potential of all employees.\u201d Business leaders were also excited to talk about innovation, and the well-established connection between including diverse voices within a company and being a more dynamic, more profitable company. In <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/02/15/best-companies-salesforce/\">an article outlining the methodological change</a>, Bush reports that organizations scoring highest under the new \u201cFor All\u201d methodology \u201cgrew their revenue about 10 percent faster over the same period than the companies that scored best according to [Great Place to Work&#8217;s] old methodology.\u201d</p>\n<p>What really sealed the deal though, Bush says, was the election of Donald Trump. The new president&#8217;s rhetoric was polarizing on so many issues\u2014immigration and diversity, women\u2019s rights, LGBTQ rights\u2014that many CEOs felt compelled to take a stand. They saw that their employees, and especially millennials, would not accept indifference from their workplace representatives. One head of a multinational firm that initially told Bush he might not participate in the modified survey eventually came back to say that it\u2019s the only list he wanted to be on.</p>\n<p>This year\u2019s list includes several new names at the front of the pack, indicating, says Bush, that they are purpose-driven, inclusive firms. They include Kimpton Hotels and Restaurants, Hyatt, and Workday. At the very top of the list is the software company Salesforce, replacing multi-year champion Google, which mysteriously doesn\u2019t appear in the 2018 ranking. (Great Place to Work doesn\u2019t comment on companies that are not on the list. Quartz has contacted Google and Fortune requesting comment, and will update this post if we receive a response.) <b> </b></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the top 10 Best Companies champions for 2018:</p>\n<p>1.

Go back and do a deal for only Spider-Man.\u201d</p>\n<p>That was the sentiment among the leadership at Sony Pictures in 1998, recalled then-Sony executive Yair Landau, in Wall Street Journal reporter Ben Fritz&#8217;s upcoming book, <em>The Big Picture: The Fight for the Future of Movies</em>. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-black-panther-movie-deal-that-didnt-get-made-1518703200\">An excerpt was published</a> (paywall) in the Journal this week.</p>\n<p>The studio was then offered the film rights for almost every Marvel character, from the Avengers to the Black Panther and more, for $25 million from a rather desperate Marvel Entertainment, which had just emerged from bankruptcy. Landau&#8217;s bosses reportedly turned it down and instead bought the rights to Spider-Man for $10 million, plus 5% of any movies&#8217; gross revenue, and half the revenue from consumer products.</p>\n<p>As Marvel Studios&#8217;s <em>Black Panther </em>stands poised for a <a href=\"http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=4370&amp;p=.htm\">more than $180 million opening</a>\u2014<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/10/black-panther-poised-to-smash-records-usher-marvel-into-the-future.html\">and a February record\u2014</a> in North America this weekend, the decision seems shamefully short-sighted.</p>\n<p>In the late 1990s, before <a href=\"https://qz.com/1116592/marvel-conquers-hollywood-nine-years-17-movies-12-billion-so-far/\">Marvel captured Hollywood</a> by bringing its comic-book world of interwoven story lines, superheroes, and villains to the big screen, Spider-Man was all the masses cared about. Sony wasn&#8217;t wrong to snap him up. The web slinger went on to star in half of the top 10 grossing movies featuring Marvel characters (including his supporting role in 2016&#8217;s <em>Captain America: Civil War</em>). And his six self-titled feature films have brought in $4.8 billion worldwide, according to <a href=\"http://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=spiderman.htm\">Box Office Mojo estimates</a>.</p>\n<p>But the studio missed that similar affinities could be established for characters like the X-Men, Avengers, and Guardians of the Galaxy. The 32 live-action Marvel movies released after 1998\u2014sans Spidey in the lead\u2014have grossed roughly $20.3 billion worldwide.</p>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"BJJblK4Df\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"><img src=\"https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_BJJblK4Df.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<p>Disney and 20th Century Fox ultimately saw a future that Sony didn&#8217;t. Fox made a pretty penny from its X-Men movies, and is exercising more of its Marvel movie rights with films around characters like Deadpool and Gambit. Disney picked up the movie rights that were left on the table when it acquired Marvel in 2009. It paid quite a bit more than Sony would have, however\u2014$4 billion.

Waymo applied for the permit on Jan. 12. Its application, which was reviewed by Quartz, contained images of the autonomous Chrysler Pacifica minivans the company is testing in five US states.</p>\n<p>The application realizes a long-held fear of Uber&#8217;s: that Waymo intends not just to build driverless cars, but to operate its own ride-hailing business. Waymo has been <a href=\"https://qz.com/968168/waymo-hits-uber-where-it-hurts-with-a-free-public-trial-of-its-self-driving-cars-in-arizona/\">testing a self-driving car service</a> in the Phoenix area since last April that lets passengers hail cars through an app, similar to Uber. TNC status would allow it to charge for these rides, which are currently free. Uber co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick has long believed that to compete, Uber must develop self-driving cars, too.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The minute it was clear that Google was getting into the ride-sharing space, we realized we needed to make sure there was an alternative, because if there is not, we will be out of business,&#8221; Kalanick told Bloomberg in a July 2016 interview, as Uber accelerated its own driverless technology efforts.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1209085\" style=\"max-width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-hero-m wp-image-1209085\" src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/waymo-tnc-application-cars.png?w=640&#038;h=319\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"319\" srcset=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/waymo-tnc-application-cars.png?w=640&amp;h=319 640w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/waymo-tnc-application-cars.png?w=300&amp;h=150 300w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/waymo-tnc-application-cars.png?w=700&amp;h=349 700w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/waymo-tnc-application-cars.png?w=768&amp;h=383 768w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/waymo-tnc-application-cars.png 826w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Images from Waymo&#8217;s TNC application in Arizona.</p></div>\n<p>Arizona granted the TNC permit a week and a half before Waymo commenced its trade secrets trial against Uber in San Francisco, alleging Uber stole Waymo&#8217;s knowledge on how to build self-driving cars. The two companies <a href=\"https://qz.com/1203613/uber-settles-waymo-trade-secrets-suit-as-us-may-be-continuing-criminal-probe/\">reached a settlement</a> on Feb. 9, five days into the trial, which includes Uber paying Waymo a 0.34% equity stake and agreeing not to incorporate Waymo&#8217;s confidential information into its software or hardware. But nothing prevents Waymo from competing in the ride-hailing arena.</p>\n<p>Waymo confirmed to Quartz that the TNC permit moves it a step closer to the commercial, on-demand ride service it plans to launch in Phoenix this year. &#8220;As we continue to test drive our fleet of vehicles in greater Phoenix, we&#8217;re taking all the steps necessary to launch our commercial service this year,&#8221; a Waymo spokesman said in an emailed statement. The company said it hasn&#8217;t announced rates yet for those rides. Waymo plans to operate commercially in other cities in the future, but declined to provide specifics.</p>\n<p>Alphabet chief financial officer Ruth Porat said on the company&#8217;s fourth-quarter earnings call on Feb. 1 that Waymo was excited about its progress in Phoenix, and working toward a public ride-hailing program. &#8220;Riders will be able to use a Waymo app to hail one of our fully driving, self-driving cars without a driver at the wheel,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>Uber declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Waymo sued Uber in February 2017, alleging that Uber stole trade secrets through its acquisition of Otto, a small, little-known driverless trucking company started by former Waymo employee Anthony Levandowski. Waymo alleged that Levandowski downloaded 14,000 confidential files, including trade secrets, shortly before he quit to start Otto, which he quickly sold to Uber.</p>\n<p>Google was an early backer of Uber, investing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/22/google-ventures-puts-258m-into-uber-its-largest-deal-ever/\">$258 million in 2013</a> through its venture-capital arm. But the relationship between the two soured after Uber realized that Google wanted to get into the ride-hailing business itself. It worsened further when Uber hired several top Waymo engineers to build its own self-driving program in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Larry made it very clear that he was very upset with us and not happy that we were doing autonomy,&#8221; Kalanick said during court testimony on Feb. 7, referring to Larry Page, chief executive of Google parent Alphabet. &#8220;Everything we would get in terms of a signal from other people who knew him or knew people around him was that generally Google was super not happy, unpumped, about us doing this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Driverless cars are widely believed to be the silver bullet that will make ride-hailing profitable by eliminating the main cost: wages paid to human drivers.

Quadruple jumps have effectively been a requirement for any male figure skater who wants to actually compete ever since the International Skating Union raised the point value of a quad in 2010 (after American Evan Lysacek won Olympic gold that year without attempting a single quad, even though the skater who won silver, Russian Evgeni Plushenko, actually landed one).</p>\n<p>The jump requires subverting basic survival instincts to spin faster than 400 rotations per minute (the wheels on a car going 60 miles per hour rotate about 800 times per minute) without losing control. \u201cSome kids are a little more amenable to doing that than others\u2014maybe they have less of a sense of self-preservation,\u201d says Jim Richards, a kinesiology professor at the University of Delaware, who uses motion-capture technology to help skaters refine their jumps.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_946112\" style=\"max-width: 297px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\" wp-image-946112\" src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/software.gif?w=287&#038;h=214\" alt=\"Computer model of a quadruple jump\" width=\"287\" height=\"214\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jim Richards&#8217; software uses computer models to show a figure skater&#8217;s current form attempting a quadruple Salchow (gold), and how he should alter it to land successfully (silver). A coach would use this information to tell the athlete to tuck his arms better, to achieve higher rotational velocity.</p></div>\n<p>The physics of a quadruple jump are fairly straightforward: skaters need to jump with the right combination of lift and spin, orient their bodies properly in the air, and then land gracefully despite impact forces equal to several times their body weight. When working with figure skaters, Richards concentrates on the portion of the jump that happens in the air: how high they jump (ideally, around 20 inches) and how efficiently they contract their bodies to maximize spin rate. More time in the air obviously means more time to spin the necessary 1440\u00b0, and body contraction helps thanks to conservation of angular momentum\u2014stuff spins faster when it\u2019s less spread out.</p>\n<p>There are different types of quadruple jumps, categorized based on their unique takeoffs, but the rotation in the air is basically the same for each. The techniques for the different types vary in difficulty, and are <a href=\"https://www.usfigureskating.org/content/ISU%202089-sptc-comm-goe-sov-2017-18.pdf\">awarded points</a> (pdf) accordingly in all figure-skating competitions<b>.</b> A quadruple toe loop (base score of 10.3 points, though points can be added for extraordinary technique or deducted for bad form) is worth less than a quadruple Salchow (10.5), and a quadruple flip jump (12.3) is worth a full point less than a quadruple Lutz (13.6). For perspective, Japanese skater Yuzuru Hanyu won the 2014 Olympic gold by a margin of less than five points. Between his short and long program, technical-element scores accounted for 145 of Hanyu&#8217;s 280 total points.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an interactive visual of the quadruple Lutz, the hardest individual jump that&#8217;s ever been landed (American Vincent Zhou just became the <a href=\"https://www.nbcolympics.com/video/vincent-zhou-lands-historic-trick-mens-short-program\">first skater</a> to land one at the Olympics).</p>\n<div class=\"sketchfab-embed-wrapper\"><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://sketchfab.com/models/5be0d46ad0804c62ab322d6c05008e45/embed?autostart=1&amp;transparent=1&amp;ui_controls=0&amp;ui_infos=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowvr allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" onmousewheel=\"\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>Even the world\u2019s best skaters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkatingScores/status/941084139599679489\">can&#8217;t properly land</a> most of their quads\u2014almost two-thirds of jumping passes including quads (a &#8220;pass&#8221; is comprised of either an individual jump or a combination/sequence of jumps) get point reductions for sloppiness. But losing points is far from the worst possible outcome. Many skaters end up hurt, with anything from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/sports/olympics/yuzuru-hanyu-injury-figure-skating-nhk-trophy.html\">sprained ankles</a> to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-2018-figureskating-medvedeva/2018-favorite-medvedeva-has-broken-foot-may-miss-gp-final-idUSKBN1DM0GD\">fractured foot bones</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-2018-figureskating-britain/olympics-overcoming-a-shattered-knee-figure-skater-coomes-heading-to-pyeongchang-idUSKBN1C91RV\">shattered knees</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nbcolympics.com/video/adam-rippon-dislocates-shoulder-skate-america\">dislocated shoulders</a>. Even American skater Nathan Chen, notorious for doing five quads in his free-skate program, messes up about one-third of his quad passes, according to data collected by <a href=\"http://skatingscores.com/\">SkatingScores</a>. (He dashed his 2018 Olympic aspirations by falling on two quadruple jumps in his short program.)</p>\n<p>That\u2019s not to mention more chronic issues that result from repeatedly practicing these jumps. Richards has long been concerned that young kids are practicing quads too many times as they work to master them, inflicting incredible stress on their bodies. Richards is particularly troubled by the stiff skates that the athletes use; figure skaters could mitigate the impact of their landings if they could bend their ankles, which would stop all the force of the landing hitting them at once. But, Richards says, manufacturers have no financial incentive to make safer skates.</p>\n<p>With so many injuries, the current backlash to quads has been unsurprising. Nothing undermines a performance like a nasty fall\u2014especially when it leaves your hero injured and unable to compete\u2014as when Hanyu, the Japanese skater, <a href=\"http://olympics.nbcsports.com/2017/11/09/yuzuru-hanyu-injury-video-fall-nhk-trophy-figure-skating/\">fell</a> practicing a quadruple Lutz last November and then couldn&#8217;t compete for months.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-video\" itemprop=\"video\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/VideoObject\"><meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"\u7fbd\u751f\u7d50\u5f26 Yuzuru Hanyu \u516c\u5f0f\u7df4\u7fd2\u307e\u3055\u304b\u306e\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30c7\u30f3\u30c8~ NHK\u676f 2017\" /><meta itemprop=\"description\" content=\"\u7fbd\u751f\u7d50\u5f26 Yuzuru Hanyu \u516c\u5f0f\u7df4\u7fd2\u307e\u3055\u304b\u306e\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30c7\u30f3\u30c8~NHK\u676f 2017\n\uff14\u56de\u8ee2\u30eb\u30c3\u30c4\u3092\u8df3\u3093\u3060\u969b\u306b\u920d\u3044\u97f3\u3068\u3068\u3082\u306b\u8ee2\u5012\u3001\u53f3\u8db3\u3092\u8ca0\u50b7\u3057\u305f\nYuzuru Hanyu sustains right ankle injury in practice~NHK Trophy\" /><meta itemprop=\"uploadDate\" content=\"2017-11-09T15:48:34.000Z\" /><meta itemprop=\"thumbnailUrl\" content=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Cos_gqgJmlI/sddefault.jpg\" /><meta itemprop=\"duration\" content=\"PT1M34S\" /><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cos_gqgJmlI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></div>\n<p>That said, there\u2019s no indication that quadruple jumps are going away, even if many people wish they would. There are clear benefits to a scoring system that prioritizes technical aspects like jumps: it makes competitions more transparent, so skaters know what&#8217;s required to win. Figure-skating judges are <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/johntemplon/the-edge\">notoriously biased</a> when it comes to evaluating subjective performance, but technical scores are fairly objective.</p>\n<p>Female skaters may be headed for their own quad revolution. Figure-skating coach Tom Zakrajsek says women are fully capable of quadruple jumps. He should know, as the coach for both Zhou, who just landed the first Olympic quad Lutz, and Mirai Nagasu, the American skater who just became the first woman to land a triple axel at Olympic competition. A triple axel is a jump with three and a half rotations, made especially tricky because skaters enter facing forwards. Zakrajsek said Nagasu is close to landing a quad\u2014she\u2019s done one on a pole harness, a training tool that lets coaches guide their athletes through new jumps.</p>\n<p>It may be a while before women start attempting quadruple jumps at the Olympic level, though. One challenge is that many women have hips that prevent them from contracting their bodies tightly enough to reach the necessary spin rate. But it may also just be a matter of time: Canadian Kurt Browning landed the first officially ratified quadruple jump in 1988. It took 14 years for a woman, Japanese skater Miki Ando, to do the same. Though Nagasu likely won&#8217;t compete at the Olympics (or elsewhere) with a quad jump anytime soon, Zakrajsek says \u201cthere are no limits for women.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"inline-video\" itemprop=\"video\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/VideoObject\"><meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"Kurt Browning LP 1988 World championships\" /><meta itemprop=\"description\" content=\"Kurt Browning making history here with the 1st quadruple jump ratified in competition.

Now African audiences are rewarding these efforts by contributing to the global hype and box office sales.</p>\n<p>For the first time a black superhero, surrounded by a cast of black warriors, will save his own world on the big screen. Long before it premiered the film became a celebration of filmic representation for African American audiences. For African audiences, the film represents a fantasy and a reality at the same time: where Africa could have been without interference and contemporary real-world references recognizable to Africans but usually ignored by mainstream Hollywood.</p>\n<p>The futuristic world of Wakanda shatters negative stereotypes that Hollywood has relied on for so long. It helps further that costume deisgner Ruth Carter <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/02/why-fashion-is-key-to-understanding-the-world-of-black-panther/553157/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">drew heavily on Afrofuturism</a> to dress Wakandans from everyday attire to battle gear.

According to the CDC&#8217;s director, the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-flu/u-s-officials-warn-intense-flu-season-to-continue-urge-shots-idUSKCN1FZ327\">conditions are</a> &#8220;extremely challenging and intense&#8221; and US officials estimated in December that as many as 646,000 people will die globally from the condition over the course of the year.</p>\n<p>While it may be an effective deterrent, barricading yourself indoors until winter fades is not an option. But if you embark on air travel before flu season is over, you are essentially walking into a enclosed space where you&#8217;re at the mercy of other people&#8217;s germs, subpar cleaning, and the overall toll that flying takes on your body\u2014all of which up your chances of contracting the flu or a bad cold.</p>\n<p>So what can be done? And if you do get sick on board, whose fault is it? Is it the guy in seat 32A for repeatedly coughing infectious respiratory droplets into the ether; the airline, some of whom only allot <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/05/business/airplanes-cleaning-illness.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Ftravel\">10 to 15 minutes</a> of cleaning time between flights; or you, for staying up until 3am doing karaoke on Wednesday when you could have been getting a good night&#8217;s sleep before your important business trip.</p>\n<p>According to Dr. <span class=\"s1\">Eric Milefchik, Chairman of Infection Prevention at Torrance Memorial Medical Center in southern California, the real culprit is a bit of all three. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;Airplane circulation is actually pretty good\u2014that\u2019s not the weakness of air travel,&#8221; Dr. Milefchik said in an interview. &#8220;But </span><span class=\"s1\">the density of people in a closed space is a notorious environment for respiratory viruses to spread.</span><span class=\"s1\"> If you have someone in that respiratory droplet range of three to six feet [one to two meters], and </span><span class=\"s1\">they\u2019re coughing, that\u2019s very hard to control. Airplanes also aren\u2019t cleaned very well, and those surfaces accumulate over the course of the day.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p>Ick. It&#8217;s easy to feel like the answer to this state of affairs is to embark on an aggressive personal airplane cleaning campaign, armed with wet wipes and hand sanitizer\u2014and if possible, a hazmat suit. But Dr. Milefchik says those lines of defense only go so far.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;Sanitizing wipes probably do help in terms of reducing any gross contamination of your area. But it terms of the fabric of your seat, it would be very difficult to properly sanitize your little micro environment, and of course it&#8217;s</span><span class=\"s1\"> the degree you\u2019re willing to go to if you want to carry all this equipment with you.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>So is it all just the luck of the draw? Not quite. There are several things you can do to lower you chances of getting sick from an airplane, with the most important of those steps, Dr. Milefchik says, happening long before you travel.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Get a flu shot.</strong> No, really get a flu shot\u2014even if you haven&#8217;t yet. &#8220;There are so few downsides to getting the flu shot, and only upsides,&#8221; Dr. Milefchik says. While the ideal time to get one is December, there will still be a benefit of getting one up until about mid-March, after which there is not much point.</li>\n<li><strong>Your immune system matters.</strong> <span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;</span></span>If you were exposed to a virus during air travel, your chances of getting sick will depend a lot on what your level of rest and ability to fight that virus are,&#8221; Dr. Milefchik says. So, make sure you get plenty of rest, lots of sleep, and eat healthy meals in advance of travel\u2014and don&#8217;t think you can mask bad habits by taking supplements. In other words: Regularly eating leafy greens is better than downing vitamin C tablets for 48 hours before takeoff.</li>\n<li><strong>Wash and sanitize your hands obsessively. </strong>One of the only things you have total control over when you travel is what you touch, says Dr. Milefchik, so be diligent about washing your hands and even disinfecting them again with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer when you return to your seat (especially after you&#8217;ve touched that bathroom door handle) and throughout the flight.</li>\n<li><strong>Leave your face alone.</strong> Also crucial, Dr. Milefchik says, is not touching your face, which is a great way to transmit germs into your system but is &#8220;a surprisingly hard thing to train yourself to do.&#8221; (One study found the average rate of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18357546\">15.7 hand-to-face</a> contacts per hour). While face masks, which are common in Asia, can be helpful in preventing exposure to respiratory droplets, the one downside is they often cause people to touch their face more through frequent adjustments.</li>\n<li><strong>If someone sick is in the respiratory range, ask to move</strong>. If your seat mate is coughing and sputtering, it will be very hard to avoid being exposed to their germs, which can travel up to six feet. While it&#8217;s not always possible to move seats, it is worth asking to reduce your exposure to their range. (Or, if you want to be very direct, provide them with a face mask and ask them to wear it).</li>\n<li><strong>Get out those wet wipes.</strong> Though it&#8217;s by no means a foolproof line of defense, it is worth traveling with some disinfectant wipes to wipe down the tray table, screen, arm rest, and other hard surfaces surrounding your seat.</li>\n</ol>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/face-mask-airport.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/face-mask-airport.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Face mask airport</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>China\u2019s state TV ran a racist skit with blackface as Africans for its Lunar New Year show</title>\n\t\t<link>https://qz.com/1209319/lunar-new-year-tv-gala-racist-china-africa-blackface-skit-exposes-the-uncomfortable-truths/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 13:56:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Lynsey Chutel]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[China in Africa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Africans in China]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[black face]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[cctv]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[China in Africa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Chinese laundry detergent advertisement]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Lou Naiming]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Lunar New Year]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Lunar New Year TV Gala]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[one belt one road]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[prejudice]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[racism]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[racism in China]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[sino-african relations]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[South China Morning Post]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[This is Africa exhibition]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Weibo]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://qz.com/1209319//</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[In what is probably one of the world\u2019s most watched non-sports live broadcasts, Chinese state television thought blackface was a fitting tribute to Sino-African relations.&#8230;]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width=\"601\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/chinese-skit-main.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=601\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"Lunar New Year TV Gala: Racist Africa skit exposes the imbalance in China-Africa relationship\" srcset=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/chinese-skit-main.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all 601w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/chinese-skit-main.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" /><p>In what is probably one of the world\u2019s most watched non-sports live broadcasts, Chinese state television thought blackface was a fitting tribute to Sino-African relations.</p>\n<p>As part of CCTV\u2019s New Year\u2019s Gala on Thursday (Feb. 15), producers included a <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2133558/racist-chinese-spring-festival-gala-tv-show-causes-consternation\">skit about Africa</a> that had a Chinese actress in blackface and prosthetics meant to be protruding buttocks and large breasts.

(To add subtitles, log into your Youtube account &amp; click on the triple dots icon just below the clip title)\n\n(BBC News, 15 Feb 2018) - A skit on China&#039;s biggest Lunar New Year TV show has sparked widespread criticism and accusations of racism.\n\nIn a comedy routine celebrating Chinese-African ties an Asian actress appears in blackface and with exaggerated buttocks.\n\nUsing make-up to lampoon black people - a practice known as blackface - is seen by many as deeply offensive.\n\nThe annual state media variety show is hugely popular, and has up to 800 million viewers.\n\nSome observers have pointed out that this sketch would not have been intended as offensive to Africans.\n\nHowever, this is not the first time Chinese entertainment shows have caused controversy with their portrayals of other ethnicities.\n\nThe controversial sketch was part of the four-hour CCTV New Year Gala - also known as the Spring Festival Gala - which aired on Thursday night. By some estimates, the show is the most watched entertainment programme on earth.\n\nIt starts with a group of African dancers in tribal costumes along with dancing animals. This is followed by a comedy skit where a young black woman ask a Chinese man to pretend to be her husband in front of her mother.\n\nWhile the young woman is played by a black actor, her mother appears to be an Asian actor in blackface make-up, donning a tribal costume complete with huge fake buttocks.\n\nShe walks on stage carrying a fruit plate on her head and is accompanied by what is thought to be have been a black actor in a monkey suit, carrying a basket on his back.\n\nThe skit praises Chinese-African cooperation, showing how much Africans benefit from Chinese investment and how grateful they are to Beijing. At one stage, the character of the African mother exclaims how much she loves China.\n\nChina has over the past years stepped up investment into many African countries. The sketch was set around people working on the Nairobi-Mombasa railway project.\n\nThe notion of blackface being racist is linked to the history of minstrel shows in the US and Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries where white actors would paint their skin black for condescending portrayals of black people.\n\nIn China, the vast majority of people have no experience of interacting with black people and are less aware of Europe&#039;s and the US&#039; history of slavery and racism.\n\nNonetheless, Chinese users on the country&#039;s biggest social media website Weibo have condemned the programme.\n\nComments included &quot;it&#039;s full of racism,&quot; that &quot;it makes me feel like I&#039;m living in the last century,&quot; and that &quot;we are going to lose face internationally&quot;.\n\nPutting it into a larger context beyond the specific history of blackface, one user asks &quot;if an American white person painted yellow, says I love the USA and recites some Trump quotes while pulling his eyes, how would you feel?&quot;\n\nSome Chinese articles criticising the annual gala on the eve of Lunar New Year, China&#039;s biggest holiday, have been blocked overnight, as have some critical comments on Chinese social media sites.\n\nSource: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-43081218\n__________________________________________________\" /><meta itemprop=\"uploadDate\" content=\"2018-02-16T06:58:18.000Z\" /><meta itemprop=\"thumbnailUrl\" content=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/siEPxHafx-4/sddefault.jpg\" /><meta itemprop=\"duration\" content=\"PT13M35S\" /><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/siEPxHafx-4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></div>\n<p>The plot of the 13-minute skit sees the presenter\u2019s African friend ask him to pose as her date to avoid a blind date her mother has set up for her.

She&#8217;s accompanied by a monkey, played by a black actor.</p>\n<p>At the end of the skit, when the presenter\u2019s Chinese bride exposes the lie, the mother character apparently says she can\u2019t be angry \u201cbecause China has done so much for Africa\u2026I love Chinese people!

Instead it betrayed just how skewed that relationship has been, exposing an uncomfortable truth with the African characters in the skit portrayed as ingratiatingly grateful to the Chinese characters.</p>\n<p>\u201cAwareness of blackface and its dubious connotations in the West are low in China and other Asian countries,\u201d wrote the <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2133558/racist-chinese-spring-festival-gala-tv-show-causes-consternation\">South China Morning Post</a>. That\u2019s been the excuse several times over the last few years as Chinese advertisers and artists face accusations of racism over their portrayal of black people.</p>\n<p>The film <em>Wolf Warriors 2</em> is set in a generic African country where the hero must save Chinese nationals from African mercenaries, all while peddling <a href=\"https://qz.com/1052857/chinas-wolf-warrior-2-in-war-ravaged-africa-gives-the-white-savior-complex-a-whole-new-meaning/\">China\u2019s own version of the White Savior trope</a> at the expense of hapless Africans. Last year, a gallery in Wuhan hosted an exhibition titled <a href=\"https://qz.com/1110191/africans-in-china-an-exhibit-comparing-africans-to-animals-shows-the-chinese-problematic-racial-attitudes/\">\u201cThis is Africa\u201d</a> showing side-by-side comparisons of Africans and monkeys. There was also the laundry detergent advertisement that saw a <a href=\"https://qz.com/693978/the-story-behind-the-racist-chinese-ad-where-a-black-man-gets-his-skin-color-scrubbed-off/\">black man have his skin color scrubbed off</a>, causing outrage within and outside China.</p>\n<p>The advertisement and the exhibition were taken down, but the film went on to become China\u2019s highest grossing film yet. As a relatively new, yet influential, player in geopolitics claiming ignorance about an international understanding of race relations just isn\u2019t good enough anymore. Especially as an increasing number of Africans <a href=\"https://qz.com/1081203/china-in-africa-guangzhou-is-a-global-city-for-african-entrepreneurs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">live</a> and<a href=\"https://qz.com/1119447/china-is-training-africas-next-generation-of-leaders/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> study</a> in China.</p>\n<p>Those defending the skit point to the fact that China never colonized Africa or that there were African performers on stage. Neither selective history, nor the complicity of people of color make racism acceptable\u2014just ask <a href=\"https://qz.com/1098466/dove-racist-ad-black-model-defends-campaign/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dove</a>, <a href=\"https://qz.com/1106557/nivea-accused-of-racism-with-fair-skin-advertising-campaign-in-africa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nivea</a>, <a href=\"https://qz.com/1179201/hm-advert-south-africans-trash-hm-stores-demanding-racist-retailer-shut-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">H&amp;M</a>, the <a href=\"https://qz.com/307305/the-dutch-dont-think-its-racist-for-santa-to-have-black-slaves/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Netherlands</a> and others.</p>\n<p>And it seems that some Chinese audiences immediately recognizied how problematic the skit was. What\u2019s on Weibo <a href=\"https://www.whatsonweibo.com/cctv-spring-festival-galas-racist-africa-comedy-sketch/\">tracked a surge</a> in the use of the words \u201cawkward\u201d and \u201cracist\u201d in messages related to the skit.

1024px\" /><p>SpaceX aims to launch two satellites of a new constellation on Feb. 18, the start of a network it expects to one day include more than 4,000 orbiting spacecraft beaming the internet to customers below\u2014and generating billions of dollars in new revenue for the rocket maker.</p>\n<p>Ajit Pai, chair of the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates satellite broadcasts in the US, endorsed the plan to &#8220;to unleash the power of satellite constellations to provide high-speed Internet to rural Americans.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But SpaceX&#8217;s chief rival, a satellite company called OneWeb, says CEO Elon Musk&#8217;s latest plans are downright dangerous to humans on the ground and spacecraft in orbit, potentially created &#8220;for the purposes of delaying and frustrating a competitor.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Welcome to the friendly race to sell the world satellite internet.</p>\n<p>Both companies plan to invest billions in an unproven communications architecture: Rather than a dozen large, powerful satellites broadcasting to Earth from tens of thousands of kilometers away, they will utilize thousands of comparatively small satellites, less than 1,500 kilometers above the planet. The swarming satellites will be able to provide constant, low-latency internet connections to users\u2014if their designers can handle the tricky task of managing the satellites and the signals passed between them and with ground stations below.</p>\n<p>This idea had been tried in the 1990s, <a href=\"https://qz.com/294888/satellite-internet-is-a-space-business-widow-maker-so-why-does-elon-musk-want-in/\">to resounding failure</a>. Now a new generation of space entrepreneurs thinks that increasingly small and powerful electronics, lower launch costs and growing demand for internet access make a better business case.</p>\n<p>Greg Wyler, a telecom entrepreneur who founded another successful satellite company called O3b, is the executive behind OneWeb, which owns key spectrum rights and has the backing of such diverse figures as Richard Branson, <a href=\"https://qz.com/866776/a-billion-dollar-investment-from-japanese-tycoon-masayoshi-son-will-fuel-onewebs-ambitious-plan-to-deliver-fast-satellite-internet/\">Masayoshi Son</a> and Airbus. Wyler and Musk once contemplated working together, but <a href=\"https://qz.com/434997/inside-the-race-to-create-the-next-generation-of-satellite-internet/\">their partnership fell apart</a> and they became competitors.</p>\n<p>Wyler&#8217;s team argues that it is advantaged by spectrum rights granted by the International Telecommunications Union, a United Nations body that coordinates telecom regulation around the world. It has already won approval from the FCC to offer its service in the US, but it has yet to launch any satellites and reportedly will do so by the end of this year.</p>\n<p>Launching the first demonstration satellites is a win for Musk, especially if it allows his company to bring its full constellation, known as Starlink, online earlier. One of the many challenges with these proposals is mass producing the number of satellites required. Wyler had contemplated launching this constellation with Google, but left over concerns about its manufacturing prowess. OneWeb is currently building a satellite factory in Florida, outside of Kennedy Space Center. In putting two satellites into space, albeit for testing purposes, SpaceX is showing off its production chops. (Neither SpaceX nor OneWeb responded to questions about their plans.)</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1208372\" style=\"max-width: 201px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"size-hero-l wp-image-1208372\" src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-15-at-9-33-23-am.png?w=191&#038;h=416\" alt=\"OneWeb's depiction of its own hypothetical satellite constellation and that of SpaceX. \" width=\"191\" height=\"416\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">OneWeb&#8217;s depiction of its own hypothetical satellite constellation and that of SpaceX subsidiary Space Exploration Holdings.</p></div>\n<p>But there&#8217;s more than just billions at risk in these projects\u2014debris in orbit already threaten spacecraft, and adding thousands of new satellites could exacerbate the problem if not done carefully. That&#8217;s especially true as multiple companies prepare mega-constellations; beyond OneWeb, Boeing, Telesat and Space Norway are considering such schemes.</p>\n<p>OneWeb in particular has complained to regulators about the &#8220;dramatically increased risk of collision&#8221; presented by SpaceX&#8217;s plans. In one November 2017 meeting with FCC officials, they portrayed SpaceX as refusing to answer questions about their constellation&#8217;s safety, saying it was &#8220;most troubled by [SpaceX&#8217;s] puzzling proposal to place its constellation in dangerously close proximity to (and interwoven with) OneWeb\u2019s pre-existing constellation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Of course, in this case OneWeb means &#8220;pre-existing&#8221; as approved on paper, not actually in the sky\u2014which underlines why SpaceX&#8217;s engineers are so eager to get their satellites up first. The company is counting on its reusable rockets to help it deploy satellites faster than competitors.</p>\n<p>In an FCC filing, SpaceX said OneWeb&#8217;s concerns were &#8220;unfounded&#8221; and accused OneWeb of &#8220;once again seek[ing] to establish new and unwarranted orbital debris and casualty risk requirements that would also apply to SpaceX\u2014and SpaceX alone.&#8221; Ultimately, SpaceX&#8217;s filings claim that its system &#8220;demonstrated that it will meet or exceed all existing US and international requirements for safety of operations in space and upon de-orbit of satellites.&#8221; Given the enthusiastic endorsement of the FCC&#8217;s head, it appears the company has at least satisfied the light-touch regulators of the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>The move into operating its own constellation is a potentially lucrative one for SpaceX; <a href=\"https://qz.com/885060/spacexs-leaked-finances-show-elon-musk-is-betting-big-on-satellite-internet/\">leaked financials suggest it is counting on the project</a> to generate the enormous amounts of money needed to realize Musk&#8217;s dreams of a multi-planetary human civilization.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Read next: <a href=\"https://qz.com/1106064/the-entire-global-financial-system-depends-on-gps-and-its-shockingly-vulnerable-to-attack/\">The entire global financial system depends on GPS, and it\u2019s shockingly vulnerable to attack</a></strong></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/spacex-satellite-internet-elon-musk-starlink-space-oneweb-greg-wyler.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/spacex-satellite-internet-elon-musk-starlink-space-oneweb-greg-wyler.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">SpaceX satellite internet Elon Musk Starlink space OneWeb Greg Wyler</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-15-at-9-33-23-am.png?w=191\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">OneWeb&#039;s depiction of its own hypothetical satellite constellation and that of SpaceX. </media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Fake accounts for the Florida shooter are spreading on Instagram, and that\u2019s dangerous</title>\n\t\t<link>https://qz.com/1209056/fake-accounts-for-the-florida-shooter-are-spreading-on-instagram-and-thats-dangerous/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 12:07:23 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Hanna Kozlowska]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[broward county]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[epidemic]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[facebook]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[florida]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Instagram]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[mass shooting]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[nikolas cruz]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[shooting]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://qz.com/1209056//</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[After the deadly shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Instagram users started creating fake accounts for the alleged shooter, Nikolas&#8230;]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rtx4x2u61-e1518737351883.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rtx4x2u61-e1518737351883.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024 1024w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rtx4x2u61-e1518737351883.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=2048 2048w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rtx4x2u61-e1518737351883.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300 300w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rtx4x2u61-e1518737351883.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=700 700w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rtx4x2u61-e1518737351883.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=768 768w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rtx4x2u61-e1518737351883.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">After the deadly shooting at the </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida,</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> Instagram users started creating fake accounts for the alleged shooter, Nikolas Cruz, some containing disturbing photos that he had posted before his own account was suspended. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">This phenomenon is dangerous for several reasons, violence researchers told Quartz. For one, it helps spread disinformation, and there is a possibility it could lead to more violence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The accounts are under the shooter\u2019s name or variations. Many are private, some are public. The profile photos are often the shooter\u2019s likeness.

She cited 2015 </span><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.06305.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">work by a group of researchers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> from the University of Vermont that found an association between Twitter chatter about a school shooting and the probability of a copycat attack in the following days. The study did not establish a causal link, just a correlation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\u201cSuicidal individuals who have access to guns, and tend to blame others for their problems, are very susceptible to the lure of instant fame that mass media and social media provide them,\u201d she told Quartz in an email, imploring both journalists and social media users to refrain from identifying mass shooters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Sherry Towers, professor at Arizona State University who has studied contagion in mass shootings from an epidemiological perspective, says that, beyond potential copycat effects, there is a broader danger in the misinformation that these fake accounts breed. \u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">They are trying to push a particular narrative that might feed into someone\u2019s political agenda or conspiracy theories.\u201d When people are conned into believing a suspect perpetrated his act for certain reasons, their views on how to fix the problem of mass shootings will be fundamentally misinformed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Towers recalled a situation where she, who studies these topics, was nearly fooled by a fake social media account. After the deadly Las Vegas shooting, Google News surfaced for her a fake news story claiming the suspect, Stephen Paddock, was a radical Islamic terrorist, linking to a social media account that was ostensibly his. The Google algorithm failed to show her credible information. \u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">I can see how the average person can be fooled,\u201d she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">After one editor at Quartz reported one fake account for the alleged shooter, with what appeared to be an image of a corpse, Instagram swiftly removed it, but myriads of others are still online.

But the story behind the posters is far more dramatic than the placid scenes on their fronts. It&#8217;s a<span style=\"color:#000000;\"> tale that includes </span>a splashy public offering, rapid global expansion, and a precipitous fall. Successories played an unlikely, accidental role in the birth of meme culture, and in a specific brand of office humor that targets both workplaces and the hope of success within their confines.</p>\n<p>The boom, bust, and rebirth of Successories mirrors the tumultuous changes in the offices it decorated, and in the stories workers tell themselves to get through the day.</p>\n<h2><strong>The quotation quotient</strong></h2>\n<p>Successories started in 1985 with a man named Mac Anderson, a serial entrepreneur with a solid portfolio of wholesome American enterprises: a travel company focused on the US Midwest, and a food distributor that <a href=\"http://www.macanderson.com\">Anderson\u2019s website describes</a> as \u201cthe country&#8217;s largest manufacturer of prepared salads.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anderson\u2019s true passion, though, was quotations. Usually people like a quotation because of its content or lyricism, or because they admire its author. Anderson loved quotations for themselves: short, beautiful aphorisms that plucked just the right internal chord.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll my life I&#8217;ve loved quotations. I&#8217;ve probably heard every quotation out there,\u201d Anderson <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/225793\">told Entrepreneur in 2013</a>. \u201cIt&#8217;s like looking through the lens of a camera. Sometimes things are blurry, but then you tweak the lens and it becomes crystal clear. You see the quote and say, \u2018That&#8217;s how I feel!\u2019\u201d (Anderson did not respond to requests for comment.)</p>\n<p>For his next venture, Anderson envisioned a product that could fill blank offices walls and empower all those the walls might hold. Working with a small in-house team of designers, he launched in 1985 a mail order catalogue selling posters, T-shirts, mugs, and desk accessories with the company\u2019s proprietary designs. Successories bought the rights to freelance or stock images, chose a phrase, then tied the two together with a quote, often one pulled from Anderson\u2019s vast personal library of inspirational texts.</p>\n<p>The connection between the word and the image wasn\u2019t always clear. \u201cSERVICE,\u201d one read, under a photograph of a waterfall. \u201cVISION,\u201d said another, with a photograph of an Outer Banks-type beach scene because . . . well, maybe because without vision, you can\u2019t see a beach?</p>\n<p>One of the few early posters that broke the non-sequitur rule featured an image of an eight-person shell rowing across a placid river at sunrise above the word \u201cTEAMWORK.\u201d The shadows and the mist on the water obscure the rowers\u2019 faces; they could be any gender, or any race, or any group of people in the world (at least, any group with access to a boat).</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1195182\" style=\"max-width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-1195182 size-hero-m\" src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/732205-e1517448746847.png?w=640&#038;h=504\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"504\" srcset=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/732205-e1517448746847.png?w=640&amp;h=504 640w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/732205-e1517448746847.png?w=1280&amp;h=1008 1280w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/732205-e1517448746847.png?w=300&amp;h=236 300w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/732205-e1517448746847.png?w=700&amp;h=552 700w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/732205-e1517448746847.png?w=768&amp;h=605 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Teamwork.</p></div>\n<p>Teamwork, the copy read, \u201cis the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results.\u201d The empty text, the faceless figures, the utter forgettability of the photograph itself\u2014together, it added up to bland magic, a poster that could hang on virtually any wall in the world without offense, controversy, or distraction. It was the company&#8217;s bestseller, and remains so to this day.</p>\n<h2><strong>Poster power</strong></h2>\n<p>Anderson did not invent the motivational poster. Collections of quotable quotes date back as far as ancient Egypt. Victorians embroidered inspiring aphorisms onto samplers. Governments for generations have used motivational posters to nudge ordinary people toward hard things, like stoicism during the Blitz (Britain\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"http://www.keepcalmandcarryon.com/history/\">Keep Calm and Carry On</a>\u201d) or factory jobs in wartime (the US \u201c<a href=\"http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_538122\">We Can Do It!</a>\u201d poster, <a href=\"https://quartzy.qz.com/1190572/the-riveting-story-of-wartime-propaganda-that-became-a-feminist-icon/\">often dubbed Rosie the Riveter</a>.)</p>\n<p>But the genre&#8217;s big breakthrough\u2014its Gutenberg Bible, if you will\u2014arrived in 1971, when Los Angeles-based photographer Victor Baldwin published a photograph of his Siamese cat Sammy clinging by its paws to a bamboo pole, above the caption \u201cHang In There, Baby.\u201d The poster sold 350,000 copies in two years.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1195189\" style=\"max-width: 265px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1195189\" src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/hang_in_there_victor_baldwin.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=255&strip=all\" alt=\"\"   /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hang in there, baby.</p></div>\n<p>Baldwin was flooded with letters from people claiming that the sight of the plucky kitten (who in Baldwin\u2019s original photograph looks <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9d/Hang_In_There_Victor_Baldwin.jpg\">utterly terrified</a>) gave them the courage they needed recover from illness, accidents, and other setbacks. The poster inspired countless knockoffs, and identified a vast and previously untapped market of people who liked their pep talks in poster form.</p>\n<p>The precise mechanism by which a motivational poster motivates is not well understood. Being exposed to a stimulus, even one as seemingly benign as an image on a wall, can have a powerful unconscious effect on later behavior, a concept known as priming. Researchers have found that an \u201chonesty box\u201d for coffee and tea in an office break room gets<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1686213/\"> three times more</a> contributions when a picture of eyes is posted next to the box instead of a picture of flowers. In another experiment, people picked up<a href=\"https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/daniel.nettle/ernestjonesnettlebateson.pdf\"> twice as much litter</a> in a cafeteria when a picture of human eyes was on the wall.</p>\n<p>Gary P. Latham, an organizational psychologist at the University of Toronto\u2019s Rotman School of Management, has conducted several experiments on the power of motivational posters. In one, <a href=\"http://www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/facbios/file/40%20-%20Latham%20&amp;%20Piccolo%20HRM%202012.pdf\">54 call center employees</a> were randomly assigned to work in either a bare room, a room decorated with a photo of a victorious runner crossing a finish line, or one featuring a poster of smiling call-center employees. The workers who saw the runner raised more money than those in the empty room, and those who saw the work-related poster raised the most of all.</p>\n<p>Posters \u201cabsolutely\u201d have an effect on behavior, Latham told Quartz At Work\u2014just not at the conscious level.

The first brick-and-mortar store opened in a Naperville, Illinois, mall in 1991. According to a company legend repeated <a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-05-07/business/9202100659_1_successories-mac-anderson-dale-carnegie-associates\">in the <em>Chicago Tribune</em></a>, a businessman en route to New Zealand read about Successories in an in-flight magazine on the first leg of his trip, rented a car during a layover in Chicago, and drove the 60 miles roundtrip to buy some posters to take abroad.</p>\n<p>By 1995, <a href=\"http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/successories-inc-history/\">according to one company profile</a>, the company had 51 stores and 41 franchise locations in 17 states, plus retail outlets in Australia, Bermuda, Canada, the Netherlands, Ireland, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, South Africa, and the UK.</p>\n<p>The stores stocked lapel pins, paperweights, and motivational tapes, but posters were its lifeblood. At its peak in 1996 Successories sold some<a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-11-11/business/9611110131_1_successories-mac-anderson-quote\"> 3,000 framed images a day</a>, enough for 60 miles of black framing each month\u2014and <a href=\"http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/successories-inc-history/\">$56 million in annual sales</a>.</p>\n<p>Anderson&#8217;s brand of motivation had met the perfect moment. The company debuted the year after Ronald Reagan\u2019s wildly successful <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/business/the-ad-that-helped-reagan-sell-good-times-to-an-uncertain-nation.html\">\u201cMorning in America\u201d campaign ad</a> proved that unabashed earnestness could be an effective marketing tool. The bestselling nonfiction book of 1984 and 1985 was businessman Lee Iacocca\u2019s <em>Iacocca: An Autobiography</em>, a tome filled with pat motivational phrases\u2014&#8221;all business operations can be reduced to three words: people, product, and profits&#8221;\u2014that wouldn\u2019t seem out of place on a Successories poster.</p>\n<p>As the hard-charging &#8217;80s gave way to the prosperous &#8217;90s, Successories&#8217; inspirational pablum spoke to a public seeking an easily digestible spiritual supplement to its material success. The company&#8217;s heyday coincided with the debut of Deepak Chopra\u2019s first books, and a phase on the <em>Oprah Winfrey Show</em> where the talk show host started lighting a lot of candles and schooling viewers in her bespoke brand of spirituality. Profiles of Anderson during this era note that he sometimes played a soothing tape of nature sounds in the background during interviews, like a living, non-ironic embodiment of Al Franken\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/daily-affirmations-ii/3506378?snl=1\">Stuart Smalley character</a> on <em>Saturday Night Live. </em></p>\n<p>Successories echoed a message pinging around the culture: You could indeed be good enough, and smart enough, if you just tried hard enough.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re really selling motivation. This is critical to business success in the 1990s,\u201d Anderson told the Chicago Tribune in 1992.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1195186\" style=\"max-width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-hero-m wp-image-1195186\" src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/751659-e1517448872678.png?w=640&#038;h=514\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"514\" srcset=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/751659-e1517448872678.png?w=640&amp;h=514 640w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/751659-e1517448872678.png?w=1280&amp;h=1028 1280w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/751659-e1517448872678.png?w=300&amp;h=241 300w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/751659-e1517448872678.png?w=700&amp;h=562 700w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/751659-e1517448872678.png?w=768&amp;h=616 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Make it happen.</p></div>\n<p>Successories was booming, and so were many of the businesses on whose walls its products hung. The company\u2019s rise coincided with the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/08/goldman-says-u-s-economy-may-be-slowly-growing-into-the-longest-expansion-in-history.html\">longest period of economic growth</a> in US history.<strong> </strong></p>\n<h2><strong>And then we came to the end</strong></h2>\n<p>Then the Internet ruined everything. That, plus some bad business decisions.</p>\n<p>In the late 1990s, the nascent dot-com boom kicked an already-productive economy into a frenzy. The posters\u2019 gentle platitudes came as small comfort to overworked offices.</p>\n<p>\u201cI finally hung them, but not until our hours went down from 14 to 10 a day,\u201d an office manager for a San Francisco-based logistics company told the Chicago Tribune in 1997, after her employer bought $20,000 worth of Successories posters. \u201cThese posters came as a shock to us. When you&#8217;re already working 12-hour, 14-hour days, and then you get posters telling you that attitude is everything and to do it right the first time, it doesn&#8217;t go over real well.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was chaos inside Successories, too. Anderson brought in James Beltrame as COO to restructure after a string of unsuccessful internal promotions and management snafus that Anderson described in his folksy way as \u201ctrying to change the oil while driving the car down the road.\u201d</p>\n<p>What Beltrame discovered was a business in shambles. The company believed it had turned a profit for the previous year; a closer look at the books revealed that it <a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-11-11/business/9611110131_1_successories-mac-anderson-quote/2\">had in fact lost $7 million</a>. A new automated ordering system collapsed at the start of the holiday rush, leading to millions in lost sales.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere really wasn&#8217;t much that wasn&#8217;t broken,\u201d Beltrame told the <a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-11-11/business/9611110131_1_successories-mac-anderson-quote/2\">Chicago Tribune in 1996</a>. \u201cOne of the things I said was, \u2018Well, you people preach this [motivational] stuff, but it doesn&#8217;t look like you&#8217;re using it very well in your own business because you&#8217;re going down the tubes.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>The company downsized, restructured, and got back on its feet. But it was too late to capture the innocence of the earlier days, both for Successories and its customers.</p>\n<p>The tech bubble burst. And then 9/11 happened. And then the Enron scandal came to light. And by that time, the cheery simplicity of a Successories poster just seemed like a cruel joke, or at the very least an easy one.</p>\n<p>As the dot-com bubble was nearing its peak, three overworked tech industry friends spent an evening rewriting a Successories catalogue with captions of their own. Within a few years they launched Despair Inc., a direct parody of Successories. Despair Inc. also sold a TEAMWORK poster, but theirs had a photo of a snowball and the words \u201cA few harmless flakes working together can unleash an avalanche of destruction.\u201d</p>\n<p>The parodies\u2019 grim resolve resonated with post-recession workers. Successories posters by that point were so ubiquitous that Despair Inc.\u2019s \u201cdemotivational\u201d posters were easy to pass off on people who had long ago stopped paying attention to the frames on the office wall.</p>\n<p>In the early 2000s, a colleague at the suburban newspaper where I worked snuck into the office one night and quietly swapped the Successories poster in the conference room for a Despair Inc. one that read \u201cMotivation: If a pretty poster and a cute saying are all it takes to motivate you, you probably have a very easy job. The kind robots will be doing soon.\u201d If any boss noticed, they never said anything, and the team held meetings under the poster until the office shuttered in 2007.</p>\n<p>As if to prove Despair Inc.\u2019s point, the real Successories was collapsing. The company was never swift to adapt to change\u2014that switch to automated ordering nearly kneecapped it in the mid-1990s. Despite the lessons imparted in the company\u2019s CHALLENGE poster (\u201cIt is not always the strongest people who win, it is the people who never back down from a challenge\u201d), adapting its analog retail business to a digital age was one obstacle too many.</p>\n<p>In August 2002, Nasdaq delisted the stock. Anderson sold the company to a private investor for an undisclosed amount in 2004. It changed hands several times and was sold in 2009 to Teddy and Warren Struhl, a pair of brothers and entrepreneurs who relocated the company from Illinois to Boca Raton, Florida.</p>\n<p>Successories\u2019 new owners believed in the motivational mission and wanted to return the company to its original identity as a vendor of motivational office decor, adapted to the digital age. But the Struhl brothers had a bigger problem than a competing parody poster company: an Internet full of free parody posters.</p>\n<p>Unbeknownst to them, their most iconic product had become a template for one of the earliest and most popular <a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/demotivational-posters\">internet memes</a>. Unlike physical poster sellers, meme makers didn\u2019t have to worry about buying image rights. Photoshopped parodies of Successories posters proliferated much faster than the real thing, glomming up searches for actual motivational posters with pages of goofy, filthy, or otherwise offensive knockoffs.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoogle was not as sophisticated at the time and would pair us next to \u2018demotivational\u2019 posters. Our product was nothing when compared to what the whole wide world could create in over a year,\u201d said Vincent Nero, the company\u2019s vice president and general manager. \u201cUnfortunately that\u2019s not very good for one\u2019s brand.\u201d</p>\n<h2><strong>A new era</strong></h2>\n<p>Fortunately for Successories, the Internet\u2019s sense of humor changes a lot faster than trends in office d\u00e9cor. Demotivational poster-style memes are an ancient relic of a pre-gif era. The internet moved on, and Successories re-established itself as a purveyor of inspiration for a tech-savvy world.</p>\n<p>Successories now employs 26 people and counts 84% of the Fortune 500 among its clients, Nero said. It sells the kind of personalized awards that companies give out in-house for performance and customer service, plus motivational swag: clocks, stress balls, a leather tote bag that says \u201cThanks for all you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>And, of course, it still sells posters. Some have a <a href=\"https://www.successories.com/Motivational-Posters/Modern/1\">slightly refreshed design</a>, but the bestsellers are the classic original images, untouched since the glory days of the 1990s: An eagle soaring over the word \u201cEXCELLENCE\u201d; those rowers and their Teamwork; the words \u201cCustomer service is not a department . . . it\u2019s an attitude\u201d under, for some reason, a picture of a waterfall.</p>\n<p>In the company\u2019s early days, the people placing orders for Successories posters were mostly female, Nero said: secretaries and administrative assistants tasked with decorating the office. Buyers are still mostly women, he said. But now they are managing those offices, and looking for something that will inspire employees to do their best.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur typical Successories customer, the buyer is a female in a management position, over the age of 35, with a salary over $75,000, trying to manage an office and motivate people,\u201d Nero said.</p>\n<p>The company is smaller than it was in its heyday, but its ethos is everywhere. The same woman who orders a Successories poster for her office is also seeing motivational quotes as she scrolls through Instagram or Facebook, or hearing them read aloud by the teacher in the YouTube yoga class she does after work. Motivation has become just another form of media, one that can be accessed through ways more private and personalized than the shared experience of a poster on a wall.</p>\n<p>And yet, this might be an ideal time for a Successories comeback. The posters aren\u2019t interesting, but they are immune to division, offense, or controversy. Like Muzak or pretzels in the breakroom, nobody loves them, but for the most part everybody can live with them. At a time when many people aren\u2019t sure what to say in their workplace, there may be no more unifying choice than something that says, essentially, nothing at all.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_1050-e1517437627245.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/img_1050-e1517437627245.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">IMG_1050</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/732953-e1517448963100.png?w=640\" medium=\"image\" />\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/732205-e1517448746847.png?w=640\" medium=\"image\" />\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/hang_in_there_victor_baldwin.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all&#038;w=255\" medium=\"image\" />\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/734173-e1517448811724.png?w=640\" medium=\"image\" />\n\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/751659-e1517448872678.png?w=640\" medium=\"image\" />\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>How tax havens like Delaware help traffickers sell children for sex</title>\n\t\t<link>https://qz.com/1204991/backpage-com-is-registered-in-delaware-heres-why/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 12:00:24 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Max de Haldevang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[corporate secrecy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[delaware]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[human trafficking]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Nevada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[offshore]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[prostitution]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[shell companies]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Wyoming]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://qz.com/1204991//</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Backpage.com is the world&#8217;s second-biggest classified advertising website.

In California alone, <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-announces-criminal-charges-against-senior\">2,900 suspected cases of child-trafficking were linked to the site</a> between 2012 and 2016.  There are several open lawsuits against Backpage.com, including one by the California attorney general&#8217;s office for <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-announces-new-criminal-charges-against\">26 counts</a> including money laundering, but US law law enforcement officials have so far failed to shut it down.</p>\n<p>Backpage <a href=\"https://www.mccaskill.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2017.01.10%20Backpage%20Report.pdf\">doesn&#8217;t deny</a> (pdf, p.4) that people use its site to traffic children for sex, but it is protected by court rulings that say a site isn&#8217;t responsible for what users post on it. It also cites first amendment defenses of free speech. The firm operates in 97 countries and 943 locations, but in the US it is formally registered in the tiny state of Delaware, where authorities <a href=\"https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/2018/02/09/worlds-top-online-brothel-delaware-company-good-standing/308732002/\">said last week</a> that it is a company &#8220;in good standing,&#8221; and that they don&#8217;t have the power to shut down because it doesn&#8217;t have a physical presence in the state.</p>\n<p>Delaware, which has 1.3 million businesses and less than one million people, is beloved of nefarious businesses. While a lot of firms flock to the state for its low corporate tax rates, a <a href=\"https://www.mccaskill.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2017.01.10%20Backpage%20Report.pdf\">Senate investigation</a> found that Backpage picked Delaware for another reason: secrecy. Delaware law allows companies&#8217; owners to hide their true identity. This makes it very difficult to crack down on criminals who launder money through them.</p>\n<p>In Backpage&#8217;s case, company founders Michael Lacey and James Larkin apparently tried to make it seem like they&#8217;d sold the firm by setting up a complex web of international and American shell companies, starting in Delaware. In reality, they loaned $600 million to the company&#8217;s CEO Carl Ferrer to make it seem as if he had bought it from them, while they continued to control the company and receive large bonuses from it.</p>\n<p>Lacey and Larkin were still the company&#8217;s beneficial owners, alongside Ferrer, the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations revealed after subpoenaing company information for its 2017 report. It&#8217;s unclear exactly why Lacey and Larkin wanted to distance themselves from the company, but people often do so to avoid criminal liability.</p>\n<p>This is far from an isolated case. A report by anti-slavery NGO Polaris published last month <a href=\"https://polarisproject.org/sites/default/files/Executive%20Summary%20-%20Human%20Trafficking%20in%20Illicit%20Massage%20Businesses.pdf\">found that</a> (pdf, p.10) anonymous shell companies were a &#8220;staple&#8221; of firms trafficking women through US massage parlors, a $2.5 billion industry. It named Delaware, Nevada, and Wyoming as the three most notorious states for corporate secrecy.</p>\n<p>Tackling crime means forcing such companies to reveal their ownership, says Shruti Shah, vice president of the Coalition for Integrity (formerly the US branch of Transparency International). &#8220;If you really want to crack down on human trafficking, you want to find out who\u2019s profiting from it\u2014and that means ending the anonymity, because you want to know owns them, who benefits from the activities,&#8221; she says.

There was the time, for example, when I was determined to launch an internal newsletter to connect with my employees. But during a random coffee, a new training consultant on our team pointed out that, in all likelihood, no one would read it. Instead, a short weekly video from me, posted on our internal company Facebook, would be a far better way to go. She was absolutely right, of course, and I\u2019ve been making <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3062075/how-im-using-video-selfies-to-stay-connected-with-my-teams-as-ceo\">weekly CEO update videos</a> ever since.</p>\n<p>The takeaway for me from many experiences like this: Instead of teaching your employees what you\u2019ve learned over the years, consider letting them teach you instead. This is called \u201creverse mentoring.\u201d</p>\n<p>The concept of reverse mentoring was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pux40FNW9lk\">popularized in the late 1990s by former GE chief Jack Welch</a>. He saw the way that the internet was transforming business, and he recognized that GE\u2019s youngest employees had a lot to teach its executives. So he flipped the normal mentoring relationship on its head, pairing 500 senior leaders with new hires to meet regularly and learn about emerging tools and technologies.</p>\n<p>This proved to be a two-way street. Not only did seasoned leaders benefit from fresh eyes, new perspectives, and direct insights into new technology, but younger employees also got to work alongside senior executives, forge relationships, and navigate their way up the company hierarchy.</p>\n<p>The pace of technological change has only accelerated since then. With the advent of blockchain, open-source coding, and machine learning, it\u2019s easy to find yourself out of touch with the tools that your employees, customers, and competitors are embracing\u2014no matter your age.</p>\n<span class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;</span><span>Younger employees are a lot more valuable (and eager to teach) than they\u2019re given credit for.</span><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;</span></span>\n<p>Reverse mentoring can help bridge that gap. Inside my company, I\u2019ve come to rely on meetings and conversations with new hires and younger employees to stay up to date on nascent trends\u2014the ones that don\u2019t have a playbook quite yet, and where the only experts are hardcore users with a couple years\u2019 experience. Younger employees are a lot more valuable (and eager to teach) than they\u2019re given credit for, and the potential for a symbiotic relationship\u2014for senior leaders to help junior employees find their footing and career path\u2014makes this management technique a true no-brainer.</p>\n<p>Reverse mentoring can be formal with a set, regular schedule, or it can be more casual. I\u2019ll meet new employees through <a href=\"https://randomcoffee.me/email-signup\">\u201crandom coffee\u201d matchups</a>, or I\u2019ll take the time to chat at weekly company socials, where everyone gets together over snacks and drinks in real life and without a computer in front of them. Employee <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=412N_Up-1-4\">lightning talks</a> (five-minute, informal presentations on hobbies and interests) and company-wide hackathons (where teams dedicate a day or two to solving passion projects) also tend to surface new and exciting tech\u2014the kind of stuff that upends whole sectors and changes the way we do business.</p>\n<p>Here are four areas where leaders can benefit from the understanding and passion of younger colleagues, regardless of what sector you work in:</p>\n<h2><strong>Artificial intelligence</strong></h2>\n<p>There\u2019s little debate that AI will prove to be the most transformative technology since the internet itself. From cars and manufacturing to banking and advertising, progressive companies are <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2017/10/16/80-of-enterprises-are-investing-in-ai-today/#db265214d8e4\">already making massive investments</a>. But many CEOs have little idea what it can (or can\u2019t) do for them. In many cases, having unrealistic expectations for AI is just as bad as dismissing the technology itself outright.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why a little reverse mentoring here is critical. This year, commit to learning more from your developers and engineers about how AI is transforming your field\u2014not in a hypothetical way, but in a right-here, right-now way. At the same time, support them in understanding the broader business applications for this new technology.</p>\n<h2><strong>Diversity and inclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>2017 was a year when issues around diversity and inclusion, especially in media and technology, leapt into the headlines and demanded attention. Younger employees and HR professionals bring a powerful awareness around these issues, and they\u2019re often equipped with a critical-theory toolkit older leaders lack.</p>\n<p>Take, for example, sensitivity around the <a href=\"https://diversity.ucsf.edu/resources/unconscious-bias\">impact of unconscious bias</a>\u2014a term that wasn\u2019t even part of the corporate vocabulary until a few years ago. I\u2019ve benefited enormously from talking with individuals in my organization who are passionate about diversity and eager to share their knowledge. My company is now stronger for it, and the chance for younger employees to be heard and shape policy creates a real sense of ownership and unity.</p>\n<h2><strong>Cryptocurrency and blockchain </strong></h2>\n<p>Why is cryptocurrency causing such a stir? And should ordinary businesses care? At its root, much of the excitement centers around blockchain, the tech behind bitcoin: It\u2019s a digital, decentralized ledger for transactions made across a peer-to-peer network. While some critics <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5b1a5f2-5030-11e7-bfb8-997009366969\">dismiss blockchain as hype</a>, boosters insist that the applications are virtually endless, enabling companies to cheaply and safely <a href=\"https://medium.com/yope-chain/30-things-you-can-do-with-a-blockchain-b23b2ab39664\">do everything</a> from manage healthcare records to verify voters, negotiate contracts, and certify supply chains.</p>\n<p>So could blockchain change the course of your business? Receiving some reverse mentoring from early adopters among your employees\u2014hardcore enthusiasts who\u2019ve been mining and following crypto for years\u2014could offer business leaders a leg up in the years ahead.</p>\n<h2><strong>Apps (yes, apps)</strong></h2>\n<p>Do you know what apps your straight-out-of-university employees open up every day? Chances are that there\u2019s a glimpse of the future to be gleaned there. Case in point: <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccalerner/2017/12/27/hq-trivia-reaches-record-audience-on-christmas/#2510ed31835a\">HQ Trivia</a>. I started noticing younger employees playing the live game show-like app in the fall, back when it only had a few thousand users. Now it engages <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/1-million-people-played-hq-trivia-2018-1\">over a million</a> in a single round. Understanding what the masses are interested in allows you to see what the future of social media and gaming might look like.</p>\n<p>Getting reverse mentoring in apps might seem trivial, but before Uber, WhatsApp, or Instagram were multibillion-dollar, industry-changing behemoths, they were apps on some 20-something\u2019s phone that no one over the age of 30 had ever heard of.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">*   *   *</p>\n<p>The accelerating pace of technological change means that brand new tools and techniques are now emerging every few months, not just every few decades. Managers of all ages looking to stay relevant would therefore be wise to schedule a little reverse mentoring time into their calendar this year.</p>\n<p>Your employees represent a powerful a guide to tomorrow\u2019s customers\u2014and tomorrow\u2019s leaders. Learning from them and giving them a chance to learn from you is a win-win worth prioritizing.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/tim-cook-happy.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/tim-cook-happy.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Tim Cook happy laugh</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The case for Spanish-speaking courts in places like the Bronx\u2014and all over the US</title>\n\t\t<link>https://qz.com/1202841/the-case-for-spanish-speaking-courts-in-places-like-the-bronx-and-all-over-the-us/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 12:00:10 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Terena Bell]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[bilingual]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[court]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ideas]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[innocence project]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[justice system]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[new york]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[PS]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[public defense]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Spanish]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Spanish-speaking Americans]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[tax]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Terena Bell]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[The Bronx]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[trials]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[wrongful conviction]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://qz.com/1202841//</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The Bronx\u2019s jury shortage has a relatively simple fix.

If New York courts are brave enough to try it, the solution would speed up trials, make verdicts more accurate, and save taxpayers more than $4 million a year. So what is it? Trials in Spanish.</p>\n<p>Jodi Morales, an attorney with The Bronx Defenders\u2014a public defense organization, says there\u2019s no legal reason why court proceedings are restricted to English. Unlike other countries, the United States does not have an official language. English is what\u2019s most spoken nationwide, so the courts and other government institutions use it by default. But Spanish is gaining:</p>\n<p>In communities like The Bronx, Spanish is already lingua franca: Less than half of those who live there speak English. As a result, the borough has a linguistically-broken judicial system that no longer mirrors the population it was designed to serve.</p>\n<p>The Bronx\u2019s current jury shortage is evidence of the break. New York Judiciary Law 510 requires jurors \u201cbe able to understand and communicate in the English language.\u201d This fluency is required even when no one involved with the case speaks it. \u201cEverybody spoke Spanish,\u201d an anonymous juror told <em>Quartz</em>, referencing a trial he sat in June: \u201cThe defendant, the witnesses, all of us on the jury.\u201d But because of \u00a7510, taxpayers paid an interpreter $300 a day to interpret proceedings into English\u2014incorrectly, he adds: \u201cAt one point [the interpreter] said something and we all just looked at each other because we knew that wasn\u2019t what the [witness] said.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bilingual herself, Morales says errors are rare but when they happen, \u201cThe judge will tell the jury, \u2018Even if you have an understanding of the language, whatever the interpreter says is the evidence\u2019\u201d\u2013even if the mistake completely changes the case.</p>\n<p>And for <a href=\"https://www.innocenceproject.org/cases/angel-gonzalez/\">Angel Gonzalez</a>, it did. In Waukegan, Illinois, Vanessa Potkin, Director of Post-Conviction Litigation for The Innocence Project, says translation error lead to Gonzalez\u2019s wrongful conviction. He spent over 20 years in prison for a rape he didn\u2019t commit: His statement professing innocence was mistranslated as a confession.</p>\n<p>In The Bronx, Morales says limited-English defendants often take a plea \u201cbecause they don&#8217;t feel comfortable communicating.\u201d Take someone accused of jumping the turnstile, for example\u2014the term used for hopping over a subway gate to avoid paying fare. In English, Morales says this is called \u201ca violation. And in Spanish the word <em>violaci\u00f3n </em>means rape&#8230;[I]t scares people because they&#8217;re like, \u2018Wait a minute, I&#8217;m not charged with rape!\u2019\u201d She explains many limited-English defendants eventually give up, saying, \u201cI don&#8217;t want to deal with this anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Spanish-speakers don\u2019t plea out, their trials are delayed for multiple reasons\u2014first, the jury shortage. During selection for a December trial, Morales says \u201cmore than half of the prospective jurors had to be released because they did not speak the language&#8230; It makes our jury selection take a lot longer, it makes cases drag out, and it&#8217;s just overall very difficult to find qualified jurors.\u201d This is also the case in Queens, where six different burglary and murder verdicts were appealed last March after <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/queens-judges-threaten-jurors-bad-english-article-1.3002840\">presiding judges said the jurors didn\u2019t speak English well enough</a>.</p>\n<p>Then there are the other delays: Hearings postponed until an interpreter can be scheduled, ones that start late because the interpreter\u2019s stuck on another case. Once the trial begins, interpreters have to repeat everything that\u2019s said, so proceedings take twice as long.</p>\n<p>This extra time gives witnesses a chance to change their story. When someone bilingual takes the stand, Morales says, \u201c[T]hey&#8217;re hearing the questions twice, so it gives them an opportunity to change their answer.\u201d Typically, she explains, \u201cthe more witnesses you call, the more inconsistencies there are,\u201d but at one recent trial, the prosecutor\u2019s witnesses were all bilingual, giving them time \u201cto connect their answers to one another.\u201d</p>\n<p>Simply put, Spanish-speaking Americans rarely receive their constitutional right to a fair and speedy trial. \u201cIf we&#8217;re trying to have a fair justice system, then we need to make the justice system accessible to the constituents and make it reflect the community,\u201d Morales says.</p>\n<p>If a sense of justice isn\u2019t enough to persuade the courts that trials in Spanish are a good idea, maybe money will be. This fiscal year, New York State Unified Court System plans to spend $4,031,755 on contract interpreters. Millions more will go toward salaries and benefits for <a href=\"https://www.nycourts.gov/publications/pdfs/ActionPlanCourtInterpretingUpdate-2011.pdf\">300+ employed interpreters</a> and additional staff in the courts\u2019 Office of Language Access, which manages interpreting. Then there\u2019s the expense of overly-lengthy trials: Court reporter overtime, defendants left in holding at <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-jails-spend-average-118g-year-hold-inmate-article-1.3176311\">$325 a day</a>, and other ancillary costs budgeted up to $7.5 million this year. At a certain point, Spanish-language trials aren\u2019t a question of social justice.

Nobody can yet say with certainty how much business Amazon is siphoning from other fashion retailers, and other than Amazon, nobody knows exactly what customers are buying on the site. But the results offer a hint about which companies should be most concerned about Amazon&#8217;s fashion ambitions, and in what areas they&#8217;re losing out.</p>\n<h2>Amazon&#8217;s clothing business is getting bigger</h2>\n<p>Various sources estimate that Amazon is now the biggest clothing retailer in the country based on merchandise volume, thanks in large part to its massive third-party marketplace. In Coresight&#8217;s survey, of the 1,564 respondents who said they bought clothes or footwear in the last year, more had actually done their shopping at Walmart than at any other retailer. But Amazon came in second, just edging out Target and Kohl&#8217;s.</p>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"SyHOC7mvz\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"><img src=\"https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_SyHOC7mvz.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<h2>The companies losing clothing dollars to Amazon</h2>\n<p>That rapid growth comes at the expense of competitors. Coresight identified 446 people who said they spend more of their clothing and footwear budget at Amazon than they did about three years ago, and asked them which retailers they switched their spending away from. The top answers were Target and Walmart, two of America&#8217;s big-box giants.</p>\n<p>Department stores including Kohl&#8217;s, Macy&#8217;s, and JCPenney weren&#8217;t far behind. Further down the list were inexpensive and off-price retailers, from Old Navy and Gap to TJ Maxx and Nordstrom Rack.</p>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"SJKlHQQDz\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"><img src=\"https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_SJKlHQQDz.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<h2>The clothing categories Amazon shoppers are buying</h2>\n<p>Coresight also asked the 719 people in the survey who said they had bought clothing or shoes from Amazon in the last year about what items they were buying. Contrary to the idea that people are just stocking up on socks and underwear, footwear was by far the top category. Women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s casual clothing took the next spots on the list. It&#8217;s still a safe bet that people tend to buy basics on Amazon more than trendy fashion, as <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-10-02/amazon-apparel-is-too-basic-for-its-fashion-ambitions\">other research has found.</a> But the results show that Amazon is finding shoppers who aren&#8217;t just loading up on white tube socks.</p>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"rJjl5Q7vz\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"><img src=\"https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_rJjl5Q7vz.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<h2>The clothing and footwear brands people buy on Amazon</h2>\n<p>Coresight asked people who had bought clothes or footwear on Amazon in the last year what brands they&#8217;d purchased. The results show that another Amazon strategy\u2014private fashion labels\u2014is working well. When combined, its <a href=\"https://qz.com/1039381/amazon-owns-a-whole-collection-of-secret-brands/\">own private labels</a>, including Amazon Essentials, Lark+Ro, Goodthreads, Rebel Canyon, and more, came in ahead of well-known labels like Adidas and Calvin Klein. (The private labels wouldn&#8217;t have fared as well individually, of course.) Only Nike, Under Armour, and Hanes beat out Amazon&#8217;s private labels.</p>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"r1l-lEXPf\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"><img src=\"https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_r1l-lEXPf.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<h2>The takeaway</h2>\n<p>One other notable finding was that survey respondents who were Amazon Prime members were much more likely to have purchased clothing or footwear from Amazon than non-Prime members. In fact, among Prime members, Amazon was the clothing retailer most had shopped at, while among non-Prime members, Amazon was just the seventh most-popular retailer.</p>\n<p>For Amazon, that&#8217;s an advantage, as opposed to a problem. Prime membership keeps growing rapidly; by one estimate, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/08/amazon-prime-will-be-in-more-than-half-of-us-households-by-years-end.html\">more than half</a> of US households now have a Prime account. As Prime continues its spread, the indication is that more of those households will start buying their clothes on Amazon, likely to the detriment of stores such as Target and Walmart. Some companies, <a href=\"https://qz.com/1018696/nike-confirmed-its-partnership-with-amazon-which-comes-with-major-risks-to-its-brand/\">such as Nike</a> and Hanes, might benefit. But the one that stands to gain most of all, of course, is Amazon itself.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rtx4tvci-e1518712577452.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rtx4tvci-e1518712577452.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Amazon boxes</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Meet the scientist who makes identical snowflakes</title>\n\t\t<link>https://qz.com/1208669/meet-the-scientist-who-makes-identical-snowflakes/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 11:00:27 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Erik Olsen]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[california]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[California Institute for Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[caltech]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[physics]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[quartz video]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[science]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[snow]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[snowflakes]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://qz.com/1208669//</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The old adage &#8220;No two snowflakes are alike,&#8221; is wrong.

At least in the laboratory.</p>\n<p>So says <a href=\"http://www.snowcrystals.com/\">a scientist</a> at the <a href=\"http://www.caltech.edu/\">California Institute of Technology</a> who has been making twin, and even triplet and quadruplet snowflakes in controlled conditions inside a homemade snowflake creation chamber.</p>\n<p>Kenneth Libbrecht is part physicist, part artist, with eight books about snowflakes to his name, each of which contains some of the most lovely photos of snowflakes you will ever see.</p>\n<p>Libbrecht works out of a cramped, dimly-lit lab on the Caltech campus\u2014one that is strewn with the equipment he uses to make minute, intricately complex snowflakes. The process is relatively simple, he says.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1208949\" style=\"max-width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1208949\" src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/f0125a050a.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640&strip=all\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"587\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kenneth Libbrecht</p></div>\n<p>Inside of boxy snowflake chambers, he cools the air to below freezing, and slowly adds water vapor until crystals form on a flat substrate. By carefully controlling temperature and humidity (the amount of water he adds), he is able to construct a wide array of different snowflake types\u2014some with long needle-like spikes, and others with gem-like facets.</p>\n<p>His favorites are strange, columnar crystals that look more like pencils than the star-shaped snowflakes we know from Christmas cards (those, by the way, are known as &#8220;stellar dendrites&#8221;).</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1208951\" style=\"max-width: 509px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1208951\" src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/d1219b055a.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640&strip=all\" alt=\"\" width=\"499\" height=\"572\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kenneth Libbrecht</p></div>\n<p>How many types of snowflakes are there? Well, Libbrecht says that there really is no agreed upon number. Researchers in Japan <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257132993_A_global_classification_of_snow_crystals_ice_crystals_and_solid_precipitation_based_on_observations_from_middle_latitudes_to_polar_regions\">suggest</a> there are 39 different types, but Libbrecht says it all depends on what you mean by &#8220;type&#8221;.  He likens categorizing snowflakes to determining types of bread: is sourdough its own type or is it merely white bread? White pita, wheat pita or just pita?</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can have lots and lots of typical breads, and you can go on for hundreds of kinds of breads if you want,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But maybe that&#8217;s too many, and same with snowflakes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In other words, we just can&#8217;t be sure.</p>\n<p>But if there&#8217;s one thing we can be sure about it&#8217;s this: ALL snowflakes have six sides. This is due to the way that water molecules connect with one another when they freeze, creating a hexagon. It&#8217;s a law of physics.</p>\n<p>Which brings us to one of Ken&#8217;s proudest contributions to snowflake science.</p>\n<p>Hanging on the wall of his office is a poster for <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2294629/\"><em>Frozen</em></a>, the Academy Award-winning film for which he was hired by The Walt Disney Company as a &#8220;snowflake consultant&#8221;.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1208967\" style=\"max-width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"wp-image-1208967 size-hero-m\" src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/p03b380n.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640&strip=all\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/p03b380n.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640 640w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/p03b380n.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300 300w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/p03b380n.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=700 700w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/p03b380n.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=768 768w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/p03b380n.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kenneth Libbrecht</p></div>\n<p>&#8220;I went and just told them all about how snowflakes always had six sides. They never have eight, they never have seven,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And then the movie came out and they were all six-sided. It was t<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">he first time I was really excited about the Oscars, and, you know, my movie won.</span>&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although he grew up around a lot of snow in North Dakota, Libbrecht says his interest in snowflakes wasn&#8217;t sparked until he started making them in the lab. After decades of work, he&#8217;s now made thousands of them, performing numerous experiments in shape and form. One of his most recent experiments is making what he calls &#8220;identical twin&#8221; snowflakes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I realized that if you grow two snowflakes very close to one another, you could sort of subject them to the same growth conditions at the same time,&#8221; he says. The result are two (or even three and four) snowflakes that do look exactly the same. He says that may not be the case on the molecular level, but to the novice&#8217;s eye, they look the same.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1208960\" style=\"max-width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1208960 size-hero-m\" src=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/1k3a0607a.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640&strip=all\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"446\" srcset=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/1k3a0607a.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640 640w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/1k3a0607a.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1280 1280w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/1k3a0607a.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300 300w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/1k3a0607a.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=700 700w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/1k3a0607a.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kenneth Libbrecht</p></div>\n<p>All of this begs the question whether there is a practical purpose for all this work.

Most recently, researchers at the University of Connecticut <a href=\"http://aem.asm.org/content/early/2018/02/05/AEM.00044-18.abstract\">discovered</a> (pdf) that bacterial spores they had been growing in labs somehow wound up in the air of 36 bathrooms, some in the same building wing as the lab and some in two other wings connected to it. Subsequently they found that air dryers in these bathrooms played a large part in circulating these bacteria\u2014meaning the machines are probably coating the newly-washed hands of anyone using them with bacteria.</p>\n<p>To be clear, this work doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean air dryers pose a health risk for hand-washers. It does, however, suggest in some cases paper towels may be superior to air dryers. In areas where there are pathogens known to cause people harm (like certain labs), or where a large portion of potential air-dryer users have compromised immune systems (like a retirement home or perhaps certain wings of a hospital), it&#8217;s best not to spread around microbes any more than necessary.</p>\n<p>Peter Setlow, a microbiologist and one of the lead authors of the paper, frequently studies spores of the benign bacterial species <em>Bacillus subtilis</em>, and so needs to produce huge quantities of them for his work. He and his team were curious to see if these spores, which should be unique to his lab, were capable of making their way into other parts of the building he worked in\u2014namely the bathrooms, which are communal space accessed at some point by everyone in the facility.</p>\n<p>They took samples from inside bathroom air dryers, from air blown by both dryers, and from air blown slower fans they brought in specifically for the study. Nothing much grew in the petri dishes hosting samples from the air dryer itself, but the petri dishes with samples taken from the air blown on them grew up to 60 colonies of live bacteria in addition to <em>B. subtilis</em> spores. Researchers also left petri dishes out in the ambient air and found just a few colonies growing in them. This suggests that there are always bacteria floating around bathroom air, including some from different parts of the building, and that although air dryers don\u2019t necessarily cultivate these microbes, they do circulate them.</p>\n<p>Setlow also doesn&#8217;t consider these findings particularly worrisome. Microbes, after all, are everywhere, and hand dryers aren\u2019t making anyone sick as far as science can tell. And this work supports conclusions from researcher at the Mayo Clinic from 2012: After reviewing 12 studies, they <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(12)00393-X/abstract\">found</a> that paper towels are probably better from a hygiene perspective.</p>\n<p>But they may not be better overall\u2014they\u2019re more expensive, cause more waste, and, if used insufficiently, don\u2019t actually get hands all the way dry\u2014which is a key step to preventing bacterial spread from person to person.</p>\n<p>Thomas Murray, a pediatrician at Connecticut Children&#8217;s Medical Center and co-author of the paper, says that in general, the findings don&#8217;t present enough of a concern for everyone to switch to using paper towels. Although there may be more bacteria floating around the air, most of these potential pathogens are no match for a healthy human immune system, he says.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/hand-washing.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/hand-washing.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">hand washing</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Marvel&#8217;s movie footprint is comically massive</title>\n\t\t<link>https://qz.com/1206265/marvels-movie-footprint-is-comically-massive/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 10:00:56 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Ashley Rodriguez]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Glass]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Business]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Disney]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Entertainment]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Fox]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Marvel]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[marvel movies]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[marvel studios]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[media]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Sony]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://qz.com/1206265//</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Is it starting to seem like Marvel is everywhere?

The Marvel Cinematic Universe&#8217;s <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>, which will debut in May, may feature <a href=\"http://www.slashfilm.com/avengers-infinity-war-characters-list/\">more than 70 characters</a>. Marvel Studios is also looking beyond the Avengers in movies <a href=\"https://quartzy.qz.com/1196551/black-panther-is-more-than-a-film-it-carries-the-hopes-of-the-global-african-diaspora/\">like <em>Black Panther</em></a>, which hits theaters this week. Sony, meanwhile, is delving deeper into the Spider-Man universe with its first <em>Venom </em>film, and Fox has franchises based on characters like Deadpool and Jean Grey.</p>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"ryalTVQDf\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"><img src=\"https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_ryalTVQDf.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<p>Last year, live-action features based on Marvel Comics characters comprised roughly 12% of returns for all movies released in the US and Canada, based on an analysis of <a href=\"http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2017&amp;p=.htm\">Box Office Mojo data</a> by Quartz. That&#8217;s not including animated features like the Sony&#8217;s upcoming <em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, </em>or movies tied to Marvel imprints like the <em>Kingsman </em>franchise. And there&#8217;s also numerous Marvel series on TV and streaming video services.</p>\n<p>To get an idea for how much Marvel is poised to monopolize the movies, Quartz&#8217;s data scientists collected data on the rise of Marvel-based movies since 2000, and using finely tuned statistical models, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120509-radiation-rage\">gamma rays</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_X#Powers_and_abilities\">psionic powers</a> they projected the group&#8217;s annual theatrical footprint over the next 20 years.</p>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"HyYeiAevG\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"><img src=\"https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_HyYeiAevG.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<p>Based on current trends, our forecast suggests that there will be one Marvel movie hitting theaters every month in 2023, and one per week in the year 2036.

But most of the time, I don&#8217;t. There are just too many good podcasts to get through.</p>\n<p>So vast is the number and variety of podcasts in the mediascape, there is always something to listen to. But unlike a lot of the bite-sized content on the internet, most podcasts are enough of a time investment that a level of discernment goes into deciding which episodes to hit play on. My similarly podcast-obsessed sister&#8217;s criteria is particularly exacting: &#8220;I have to be so emotionally invested that I&#8217;m either laughing out loud or sobbing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When it comes to my own lineup, I recently noticed a trait that makes me cut a given episode automatically: if it was recorded in front of a live audience. While there are several popular podcasts series that have always been recorded as such\u2014<em>The Moth</em> and <em>2 Dope Queens</em>, for example\u2014my particular gripe is for podcasts normally recorded in studio, but every now and then record in front of a live audience and upload the result as a regular episode. The popular political podcast <em>Pod Save America</em>, which recently announced a series of<a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2018/02/pod-save-america-is-heading-to-hbo.html\"> hour-long specials with HBO</a>, is a regular offender. I happily listen to their studio episodes, which can go well over an hour long, but I can&#8217;t for the life of me make it through one of their now-frequent live audience episodes.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s true this format is not particularly new, but, anecdotally at least, it seems to be becoming more common. And given the industry is<a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/09/an-island-no-more-inside-the-business-of-the-podcasting-boom/\"> grasping for</a> a viable business model despite its burgeoning popularity (Casper, SquareSpace, and MeUndies ad spots cannot sustain them all) it&#8217;s easy to see why podcasts are treating live shows like musicians treat live gigs: as a cash cow. And with prestige media companies like HBO making a play in the podcast space, we&#8217;re likely to see more overlap between podcasting and other forms of entertainment in the future. In fact just this week it was announced that the <em>New York Times</em>&#8216; podcast <em>The Daily</em> has become so popular that a longer version will <a href=\"http://current.org/2018/02/new-york-times-the-daily-podcast-headed-to-public-radio/\">be syndicated</a> by American Public Media starting in April.</p>\n<p>And yet, I utterly loathe live recordings. They go against everything I love about the medium of podcasting itself: that it is calming to listen to, not audibly jarring or interruptive, and I feel like the hosts or guests are talking to just me. Whereas public radio greats have an air of authority by mere virtue of being on NPR, the connection I build up with certain podcast hosts I listened to &#8220;before they were cool&#8221; feels genuine. The fact that it&#8217;s not reciprocal doesn&#8217;t matter much\u2014until they invite an audience of people into my ears to shatter the illusion. They begin making jokes for the audience, not for me. The grating sound of applause or laughter fills the pauses that usually give me space to ponder. The echo of a theater sounds like the opposite of the uncommon silence of a studio I usually cherish.</p>\n<p>Now, before you @ me, some caveats: I get that not all live podcast recordings are created equal, both in terms of sound quality and content. And I&#8217;m also not suggesting podcasters shouldn\u2019t find a way to make money off of their growing fanbases\u2014I just have no interest in listening to them do that as a downloaded episode.</p>\n<p>When I asked Nick Quah, a podcast critic for Vulture who also writes the popular<a href=\"https://www.hotpodnews.com/\"> Hot Pod newsletter</a>, if he thought the growth of recorded-live podcasts risks alienating loyal listeners, he said it depends on how heavily you weigh what he calls \u201cthe intimacy thesis.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe intimacy thesis is the notion that podcasting&#8217;s fundamental value as a media experience lies in its capacity to create a uniquely intimate relationship between the show and the listener. I think that&#8217;s true, but I think it&#8217;s overly interpreted to be something that mostly exists between the talent and the listener,&#8221; Quah said. &#8220;I happen to think that you can create really good podcast experiences around live shows. You just have to be thoughtful and cognizant about sound quality, editing, the balance of sound between the performers and the audiences.\u201d</p>\n<p>The intimacy thesis definitely explains why I listen to podcasts with such devotion. I am so reliant on the moment each day when I leave the office and allow <em>The Daily</em> host<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/mariahoxley/we-gotta-talk-about-michael-barbaro-the-host-of-the-nyts\"> Michael Barbaro&#8217;s</a> earnest questions and just-so diction to flood my ears as I navigate the chaos of Oxford Circus station, that it&#8217;s no exaggeration to say I am thoroughly emotionally attached to the entire experience. I\u2019m hyper-alert for the moments Russel Brand goes on profound and breathless five-minute thought-tangents on his surprisingly spiritual <em>Under the Skin</em> podcast, and I don&#8217;t want an audience there that might distract him.</p>\n<p>Am I being precious? You bet. But in roughly a decade of listening to podcasts, I&#8217;ve come to prize my experience of the medium as creating a lot of space for something that most other forms of modern entertainment seem to crowd out: deep thought. While Quah contends that this intimacy can, with the right approach, be extended beyond a connection between the listener and talent to one between a listener and the &#8220;show experience,&#8221; I remain steadfastly unconvinced.</p>\n<p>I want to pretend my my podcasts are recorded just for me.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/podcast-listener.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/podcast-listener.jpg?quality=80&#038;strip=all\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Podcast listener</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n",
