This is so a robot can respond appropriately to its surroundings. For instance, if you wanted a robot to take care of a baby, you&#8217;d want to make sure the robot can be tender in a way that generally only humans can achieve with our own sensitive touch.</p><p>That&#8217;s why many in the field of robots are working on electronic skins, including <a href=\"http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/2/eaaq0508.full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a team out of the University of Colorado Boulder</a>, comprised of\u00a0Jianliang Xiao, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering and Wei Zhang, an associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry as well as a materials science and engineering faculty member.</p><p>The above babysitting use case is actually an example given by Zhang, who told <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/today/2018/02/09/new-malleable-electronic-skin-self-healable-recyclable?utm_source=colorado.edu&amp;utm_medium=New%20malleable%20%27electronic%20skin%27%20self-healable%2C%20recyclable&amp;utm_campaign=Homepage&amp;utm_content=News%20and%20Events\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>CU Boulder Today</em></a>: &#8220;The idea is to try and mimic biological skin with e-skin that has desired functions.\u201d</p><p>To that extent, CU Boulder&#8217;s e-skin has sensors not just for measuring pressure and temperature, but also humidity and air flow.</p><p>But here&#8217;s the problem with e-skin (at least from the perspective of researchers) &#8212; it&#8217;s too susceptible to damage, making it impractical for most real-world use.</p><p>Not so with CU Boulder&#8217;s creation. It uses polyimine, a type of polymer laced with silver nanoparticles that\u00a0allows the e-skin to be both self-healing and fully recyclable at room temperature.</p><p>It can self-heal using widely available ethanol compounds to patch itself up, and the material is recyclable using a solution that separates the silver from the skin in question.</p><p>That&#8217;s right, this material goes full Terminator.</p><p>Well, okay maybe not quite that far, but still, there will likely be robots in the not-too-distant future that can not only feel sensations but heal themselves. That&#8217;s a lot to take in.</p><h2>Verdict: Sticky (please be kind to me robot overlords).</h2><p>Sensation and self-healing are two things that commonly have been a key point of differentiation between humans and machines. Take that away, and we&#8217;re looking at an entirely new paradigm in the future.</p><p>We obviously need to put a lot more careful thought and consideration into robotics and AI concerns from a societal and philosophical standpoint, because scientists are not slowing down on this stuff.</p><p>But having said that, if managed correctly this technology could benefit so many people, especially those who wear prosthetics.</p><p>Thankfully, we have a while to consider all of this. Practical use in the real world is still quite a few years off. Considering the potential for massive social disruption, though, it&#8217;s best we start now.</p><p><em>Note: This post is part of an ongoing series titled Sticky or Not in which Senior Reporter Rose Behar analyzes new and often bizarre gadgets, rating them sticky (good) or not (bad).</em></p><p><em>Image credit:\u00a0Jianliang Xiao/University of Colorado Boulder</em></p><p></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/02/18/this-electronic-skin-for-robots-can-feel-things-and-heal-itself/\">This electronic skin for robots can feel things and heal itself [Sticky or Not]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mobilesyrup.com\">MobileSyrup</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded><wfw:commentRss>https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/02/18/this-electronic-skin-for-robots-can-feel-things-and-heal-itself/feed/</wfw:commentRss><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">438631</post-id>\t</item><item><title>Freedom Mobile offering 25 percent off select plans with Chinese New Year promo</title><link>https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/02/18/freedom-mobile-chinese-new-year-rate-plan-promo/</link><comments>https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/02/18/freedom-mobile-chinese-new-year-rate-plan-promo/#respond</comments><pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 14:48:24 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ian Hardy]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Carriers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Freedom Mobile]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://mobilesyrup.com/?p=439061</guid><description><![CDATA[<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/freedom-mobile-300x225.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"freedom mobile\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/freedom-mobile-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/freedom-mobile-768x576.jpg 768w, https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/freedom-mobile-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div><p>The end of 2017 saw most Canadian carriers battle for subscribers by offering a monthly plan with 10GB of data for $60.

Moving too fast or having too much thrown at you at once while wearing a headset can often lead to an overwhelmingly unpleasant experience.</p><p>That&#8217;s why it was surprising to see that developer Survios has created a VR racing title that&#8217;s <em>all about</em> high speed and tricky maneuvers. What&#8217;s more,\u00a0<em>Sprint Vector\u00a0</em>takes advantage of its &#8216;gotta go fast&#8217; conceit to offer an incredibly engaging VR experience unlike any other.</p><p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X22qJmqVE6w\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p><p><em>Sprint Vector,</em>\u00a0you take part in a charmingly absurd reality game show. You&#8217;ll be able to use one of eight distinct competitors, such as DJ, graffiti artist or gangster shark, all of whom sport delightfully quirky personalities. What really sets\u00a0<em>Sprint Vector</em> apart, however, is its gameplay, which features one of the most inventive uses of motion controls in a game to date.</p><p>To move, you&#8217;ll have to alternate swing your arms down while holding and releasing the triggers at the right time in a similar pattern to using ski poles. The stronger your swing, the more speed you&#8217;ll get. You&#8217;ll also need to move your body to turn and drift around corners.</p><a href=\"https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sprint-vector-lava.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-438891\" src=\"https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sprint-vector-lava.jpg\" alt=\"Sprint Vector lava\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sprint-vector-lava.jpg 1920w, https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sprint-vector-lava-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sprint-vector-lava-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sprint-vector-lava-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /></a><p>Stages are can also be quite vertical, requiring you to time your controller swings to jump or scale rock climbing-esque. Along to the way, you&#8217;ll have to aim your controller to shoot obstacles like barrels that can slow you down on the track. In\u00a0<em>Mario Kart\u00a0</em>fashion, there are also several power-ups you can pick up, including trip mines, a nitro booster and an upgraded blaster that shoots homing projectiles.</p><p>Admittedly, this can take a bit of getting used to. The sheer number of techniques you can perform while racing can be a little overwhelming at first, especially since they&#8217;re handled through motion control. Thankfully, the game offers multiple in-depth tutorials featuring an enthusiastic narrator and instructional live-action videos, all of which go a long way to helping you get accustomed to the controls. Survios doesn&#8217;t call the movement system &#8216;Fluid Locomotion&#8217; for nothing.</p><a href=\"https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sprint-vector-obstacle.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-438895\" src=\"https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sprint-vector-obstacle.jpg\" alt=\"Sprint Vector obstacles\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sprint-vector-obstacle.jpg 1920w, https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sprint-vector-obstacle-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sprint-vector-obstacle-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sprint-vector-obstacle-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /></a><p>It&#8217;s also to Survio&#8217;s credit that none of the experience ever felt discomforting. Even while playing for a couple of hours at at time, I never experienced any of the uneasy feelings that one might expect with such a fast-paced VR experience. That said, expect to get tired &#8212; standing while quickly turning and twisting my body can actually be quite intense. Not many games ask for this kind of physical commitment out of the player, and\u00a0<em>Sprint Vector\u00a0</em>is all the more compelling because of it.</p><p>Overall, there&#8217;s a fair amount of content in\u00a0<em>Sprint Vector.</em>\u00a0You&#8217;ll be racing in 12 well-designed tracks that take place in eye-popping colourful locations. In solo content, opposing racers are handled through surprisingly challenging-yet-fair AI opponents. There are also nine obstacle course challenges that are appropriately difficult and feel rewarding to complete, although it would have been nice if there were more of them. Survios plans to support the game with <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/games/590690/announcements/detail/2486421191995184470\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">weekly community challenges</a> as well.</p><a href=\"https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sprint-vector-explosion.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-438901\" src=\"https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sprint-vector-explosion.jpg\" alt=\"Sprint Vector explosion \" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sprint-vector-explosion.jpg 1920w, https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sprint-vector-explosion-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sprint-vector-explosion-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sprint-vector-explosion-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /></a><p>However, the\u00a0<em>Sprint Vector\u00a0</em>experience truly comes to life when facing off against other players. Because they&#8217;re headset-based, many VR games are isolating by nature and therefore lack much in the way of social elements. That&#8217;s not the case in\u00a0<em>Sprint Vector</em>, allowing you to truly test your racing skills against other people in 2-8 player races. Dashing forward past one player to launch off a ledge, twisting around mid-air to blast him with my power-up is highly satisfying. Matches also ran smoothly and free from any connection issues.</p><p><em>Sprint Vector\u00a0</em>can be tricky to master, but once you get the hang of it, the game is an absolutely exhilarating experience. Survios has developed an innovative gameplay system that takes full advantage of the immersive qualities of VR. Don&#8217;t let this racer pass you by.</p><p>Sprint Vector is now available on <a href=\"https://store.playstation.com/en-ca/product/UP2292-CUSA09777_00-SV1RELEASE000001?smcid=pdc%3Aus-en%3Apdc-games-detail-sprint-vector-ps4%3Aleadproductinfo-buy-download%3Asprint-vector%3Aup2292-cusa09777_00-sv1release000001%3Aemcid_null\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PlayStation VR</a> for $39.99 CAD ($31.99 for PlayStation Plus members until February 20th), <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1425858557493354/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Oculus Rift</a>\u00a0for $27.99 (regular $34.99) and <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/590690/Sprint_Vector/?_ga=2.155038264.1472140014.1518795965-1456609997.1518539499\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HTC Vive</a> for $32.99.</p><p></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/02/17/sprint-vector-review-psvr-htc-vive-oculus-rift-reality-bytes/\">Sprint Vector is one of VR&#8217;s most inventive games [Reality Bytes]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mobilesyrup.com\">MobileSyrup</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded><wfw:commentRss>https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/02/17/sprint-vector-review-psvr-htc-vive-oculus-rift-reality-bytes/feed/</wfw:commentRss><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">438643</post-id>\t</item><item><title>Learn a new language while having fun with the Infinite Language series [Game of the Week]</title><link>https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/02/17/infinite-language-game/</link><comments>https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/02/17/infinite-language-game/#respond</comments><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 15:01:42 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Igor Bonifacic]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[App/Game of the Week]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Apps/Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Features]]></category><category><![CDATA[Infinite Language]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://mobilesyrup.com/?p=438603</guid><description><![CDATA[<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"153\" src=\"https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/infinite-language-series-300x153.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/infinite-language-series-300x153.jpg 300w, https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/infinite-language-series-768x392.jpg 768w, https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/infinite-language-series-1024x522.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/02/17/infinite-language-game/\">Learn a new language while having fun with the Infinite Language series [Game of the Week]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mobilesyrup.com\">MobileSyrup</a>.</p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"153\" src=\"https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/infinite-language-series-300x153.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/infinite-language-series-300x153.jpg 300w, https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/infinite-language-series-768x392.jpg 768w, https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/infinite-language-series-1024x522.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div><div class=\"article-padding\"></p><p>Anytime I decide to travel to a new country, I make it a point to try and learn at least something of the local language.</p><p>If there&#8217;s anything I&#8217;ve found in my travels, it&#8217;s that\u00a0people\u00a0really\u00a0appreciate\u00a0when you try to communicate in their\u00a0native tongue. Of course, more often than not, most conversations still end in both parties gesturing, but, as with all things, a little effort goes a long way.</p><p>Later this year, I have a plane ticket booked to South Korea, and so I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of my free time trying to learn what I can of the Korean language.</p><p>The challenge with learning any new language is that you have to spend a lot of time on task to become even just a bit proficient. This is true of all languages, but is especially relevant when it comes to learning an East Asian language as a native English speaker.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.atlasandboots.com/foreign-service-institute-language-difficulty/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S.&#8217;s Foreign Service Institute ranks</a> Arabic, Cantonese, Korean, Mandarin and Japanese as the most difficult languages for native English speakers to learn, each requiring an excess of 2,200 hours of study to master.</p><p>If you&#8217;re like any adult I know, finding even just one hour, let alone the equivalent of 88 weeks, to study a new language is a Sisyphean undertaking. Then there&#8217;s the fact that most of us would rather spend time away from our responsibilities relaxing instead of taking on a new challenge.</p><p>The good news is that there are resources out there that make the experience of learning a new language\u00a0fun. Today I want to highlight one of them. It&#8217;s called the Infinite Language series.</p><p>Developed by independent\u00a0developer\u00a0Jernung, the Infinite Language series is available in 10 different versions: Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Russian.</p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-438737 aligncenter\" src=\"https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/infinite-korean.jpg\" alt=\"Infinite Korean app\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1120\" srcset=\"https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/infinite-korean.jpg 1280w, https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/infinite-korean-300x263.jpg 300w, https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/infinite-korean-768x672.jpg 768w, https://cdn.mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/infinite-korean-1024x896.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /><p>Each app follows the same simple but fun premise. Whether it&#8217;s the Korean\u00a0version\u00a0or any one of the other languages in which the series is available in, the Infinite apps promise to teach you about 200 words per language.</p><p>Once they&#8217;ve installed one of the apps, users pick a category of words they want to learn &#8212; numbers, colours, animals, fruits, etc. Each category has twelve levels, with each one introducing a new word to the mix and becoming more challenging.</p><p>Gameplay revolves around the player stopping multiple comets from falling to the ground and subsequently taking away all three of their lives away.\u00a0This is where the language component comes in, as stopping a comet involves quickly associating a visual, verbal or written cue with the correct word.</p><p>What&#8217;s brilliant about the series is that it understands learning a language involves just a lot of boneheaded repetition, but if you make that repetition fun, then it&#8217;s not so bad.</p><p>You won&#8217;t become fluent in a language with one of the Infinite Languages apps, but it might just give you the needed motivation to pursue more serious study.</p><p>Each app in the series is free-to-download and try, with in-app ads in place to support the developer. Unlocking the full experience, which expands the number of playable word categories, costs a modest $5.99 CAD per game.

This means users can use any SIM with the Nokia 6. Unfortunately, the phone may not be capable of 4G LTE depending on your carrier.

Furthermore, the device utilizes Qualcomm&#8217;s Snapdragon 430 chipset, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of expandable storage and 3,000mAh battery. In terms of camera sensor, the Nokia 6 includes a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera with a f/2.0 aperture and an 8-megapixel front-facing shooter with the same aperture size.</p><p>HMD Global, the manufacturers of Nokia-branded handsets, do not officially sell its phones in Canada which leads many to Amazon to purchase these affordable smartphones.
