While Weinstein has admitted to behaving inappropriately, he has said he didn&#8217;t physically assault anyone.</p>\n<p>One of those women is Katherine Kendall. She was a 23-year-old actress who met Weinstein in 1993. She alleges that he invited her to his apartment in New York, where, she says, he took off his clothes and asked for a massage.</p>\n<p>As other actresses began coming forward about their painful experiences, she also went public with her own story.</p>\n<p>She joins me now from Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>First, thanks for joining us.</p>\n<p>And I don&#8217;t want to relive something that&#8217;s painful for you, but you are taking a public stance on it.</p>\n<p>For people who don&#8217;t know your story, what happened?</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL,</strong> Actress/ Photographer: Well, I was you know, a young actress, and I had had a formal meeting at the Miramax office earlier that day.</p>\n<p>And then, at the end of the meeting, which I thought went really well, he invited me to come to screenings. He said: &#8220;Welcome to the Miramax family. You know, come to premieres, screenings, et cetera. In fact, there&#8217;s one this afternoon. Would you like to come?&#8221;</p>\n<p>And I said, &#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And I ended up going to see a movie with him. It ended up just being a movie, not a screening, but the film &#8220;Red Rock West.&#8221; And, you know, that&#8217;s right when I had this sort of sinking feeling that something wasn&#8217;t going right.</p>\n<p>And then, after the movie, we walked for a few blocks. And he said he needed to go up to his apartment to get something, and would I just come with him real quick? And I sort of said no, and we went back and forth on that for a minute. It was sort of a negotiation with him always, trying to sort of stand my ground, but then be convinced it was OK.</p>\n<p>I did go into his apartment. Once there, we talked for a long time about art and movies. And I felt like he was treating me like an intellect.</p>\n<p>And I felt like the meeting was going really well, and sort of continued. I didn&#8217;t feel unsafe once I was in there. And, at one point, then, he got up to go to the bathroom. And he came back in a robe and asked me to give him a massage.</p>\n<p>And I was extremely uncomfortable. And I was like, oh, God, no, I&#8217;m not comfortable with that. And we went back and forth on that.</p>\n<p>And then he went back to the bathroom again, and came back this time completely naked. And, you know, that changed it entirely for me, too. It just took it to the next place. It was completely disorienting. And I was scared, you know? I was really scared.</p>\n<p>And then it became sort of a cat-and-mouse game of, like, how am I going to get out of there?</p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m &#8212; it&#8217;s hard to make sense of what someone is trying to do to you when they&#8217;re fully naked, and they&#8217;re&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> You know, I&#8217;m 105 pounds. He&#8217;s a large man standing between me and the door.</p>\n<p>And, I mean, I felt very resolute, like, I will definitely get out of here somehow. But I&#8217;m not &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s going to happen here. You know, a lot was going through my head.</p>\n<p>And he said, well, if you won&#8217;t give me a massage, will you at least show me your breasts? And it was just &#8212; you know, it was, all in all, an extremely humiliating experience for me.</p>\n<p>And even though I got away, I felt like something had still &#8212; like something horrible had just happened to me.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> You know, in the immediate aftermath, did you tell someone about it? Because you have said before that you felt ashamed&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> I did.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> &#8230; even though you were the victim.</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> I did.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s really interesting how that happens. And I think &#8212; you know, I&#8217;m older now, and I have done some work on myself. And I have learned that a lot of people feel that way.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s &#8212; it&#8217;s not &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t just me. But the just me feeling that this is my fault, this must have only happened to me, there&#8217;s something wrong with me, is so common when someone perpetrates against you.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> What were the&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> And I did. I told my mom.</p>\n<p>And I told some good friends. But, you know, one of the things that happened was, I didn&#8217;t want them to tell anybody. You know, people wanted to help me, but they didn&#8217;t know how, and I didn&#8217;t want them to try too hard, because I didn&#8217;t want it to backlash.</p>\n<p>I was scared. And I think that it&#8217;s important to remember that we don&#8217;t really come from a culture that supports women in talking about sexual harassment, in my &#8212; in my experience, that is. And, you know, I just haven&#8217;t felt like it was something I was going to get support on&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> You know, how long&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> &#8230; in the bigger picture.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p>How long did this feeling last? Or, I guess, what are the longer-term ripple effects here? Did it shake your confidence in your abilities?</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> I think it did. I think it did. I think it did.</p>\n<p>I think it made me feel like, wow, you know, that was a wash. He wasn&#8217;t interested at all in what I had to say, or, you know, he didn&#8217;t see any talent there or intellect there. He was assessing the situation the whole time for something else.</p>\n<p>And I think that &#8212; that did hurt. You know, I wish it didn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> But he had produced so many movies that I thought were wonderful. And it was &#8212; it&#8217;s hard when someone has made art that you love, and how do you stay attached to liking their art, but feeling conflicted about them?</p>\n<p>And, yes, I think it does have long-term effects. I think you tuck it away. And then, for me, also, I realized that it came back when I would see his name or see him in person. I would start to sort of tremble all over again.</p>\n<p>I mean, I wouldn&#8217;t think about him on a daily basis or anything for years, and then I would see him, and I would think, oh, I don&#8217;t feel well. I got to get out of here.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Right.</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> You know, it would bring up so much emotion.</p>\n<p>And the most recent one was the woman in New York, the Italian model. I felt so, so enraged when I saw what happened there, and that they sort of &#8212; the police had him, and that then he got away. And then she was being dragged through the press as somebody who just, you know, wanted a payout, et cetera.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> You know, in the wake of that, there was &#8212; a friend of yours had tweeted, &#8220;At some point, all the women who have been afraid to speak out about Harvey Weinstein are going to have to hold hands and jump.&#8221; This was back in 2015.</p>\n<p>And from your Twitter account, you said, &#8220;Agreed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It seemed like you almost had the opportunity to come forward.</p>\n<p>What made you want to come forward now? Has this become a turning point in the industry?</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> This is a turning point. It&#8217;s a turning point.</p>\n<p>There are so many times when I thought about it, and then felt like &#8212; there were times when I thought about it and said, well, I have nothing to lose, I will just do it. And then I thought, I &#8212; I just didn&#8217;t have the strength or the courage yet.</p>\n<p>And I think somebody like Jodi Kantor doing the story for The New York Times, the fact that she thought it was a story at all was startling to me and made me feel like, wow, something is going to be done.</p>\n<p>And I knew she had told me &#8212; I mean, they were looking for women that this had happened to, because they&#8217;d been hearing rumors for so long that it happened to so many people. And she had told me other people were coming out.</p>\n<p>And I thought, I can&#8217;t &#8212; when I watched Rose McGowan or any of the other actresses come forward, I just &#8212; or Ashley Judd &#8212; I just thought, they look strong to me, and I don&#8217;t want to be the one that stays silent.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Well, Katherine Kendall&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> I want to stand beside them.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Katherine Kendall, thank you very much for speaking with us.</p>\n<p>And, hopefully, there are other people that are empowered by you coming forward.</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> I hope so.

She alleges that he invited her to his apartment in New York, where, she says, he took off his clothes and asked for a massage.</p>\n<p>As other actresses began coming forward about their painful experiences, she also went public with her own story.</p>\n<p>She joins me now from Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>First, thanks for joining us.</p>\n<p>And I don&#8217;t want to relive something that&#8217;s painful for you, but you are taking a public stance on it.</p>\n<p>For people who don&#8217;t know your story, what happened?</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL,</strong> Actress/ Photographer: Well, I was you know, a young actress, and I had had a formal meeting at the Miramax office earlier that day.</p>\n<p>And then, at the end of the meeting, which I thought went really well, he invited me to come to screenings. He said: &#8220;Welcome to the Miramax family. You know, come to premieres, screenings, et cetera. In fact, there&#8217;s one this afternoon. Would you like to come?&#8221;</p>\n<p>And I said, &#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And I ended up going to see a movie with him. It ended up just being a movie, not a screening, but the film &#8220;Red Rock West.&#8221; And, you know, that&#8217;s right when I had this sort of sinking feeling that something wasn&#8217;t going right.</p>\n<p>And then, after the movie, we walked for a few blocks. And he said he needed to go up to his apartment to get something, and would I just come with him real quick? And I sort of said no, and we went back and forth on that for a minute. It was sort of a negotiation with him always, trying to sort of stand my ground, but then be convinced it was OK.</p>\n<p>I did go into his apartment. Once there, we talked for a long time about art and movies. And I felt like he was treating me like an intellect.</p>\n<p>And I felt like the meeting was going really well, and sort of continued. I didn&#8217;t feel unsafe once I was in there. And, at one point, then, he got up to go to the bathroom. And he came back in a robe and asked me to give him a massage.</p>\n<p>And I was extremely uncomfortable. And I was like, oh, God, no, I&#8217;m not comfortable with that. And we went back and forth on that.</p>\n<p>And then he went back to the bathroom again, and came back this time completely naked. And, you know, that changed it entirely for me, too. It just took it to the next place. It was completely disorienting. And I was scared, you know? I was really scared.</p>\n<p>And then it became sort of a cat-and-mouse game of, like, how am I going to get out of there?</p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m &#8212; it&#8217;s hard to make sense of what someone is trying to do to you when they&#8217;re fully naked, and they&#8217;re&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> You know, I&#8217;m 105 pounds. He&#8217;s a large man standing between me and the door.</p>\n<p>And, I mean, I felt very resolute, like, I will definitely get out of here somehow. But I&#8217;m not &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s going to happen here. You know, a lot was going through my head.</p>\n<p>And he said, well, if you won&#8217;t give me a massage, will you at least show me your breasts? And it was just &#8212; you know, it was, all in all, an extremely humiliating experience for me.</p>\n<p>And even though I got away, I felt like something had still &#8212; like something horrible had just happened to me.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> You know, in the immediate aftermath, did you tell someone about it? Because you have said before that you felt ashamed&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> I did.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> &#8230; even though you were the victim.</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> I did.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s really interesting how that happens. And I think &#8212; you know, I&#8217;m older now, and I have done some work on myself. And I have learned that a lot of people feel that way.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s &#8212; it&#8217;s not &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t just me. But the just me feeling that this is my fault, this must have only happened to me, there&#8217;s something wrong with me, is so common when someone perpetrates against you.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> What were the&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> And I did. I told my mom.</p>\n<p>And I told some good friends. But, you know, one of the things that happened was, I didn&#8217;t want them to tell anybody. You know, people wanted to help me, but they didn&#8217;t know how, and I didn&#8217;t want them to try too hard, because I didn&#8217;t want it to backlash.</p>\n<p>I was scared. And I think that it&#8217;s important to remember that we don&#8217;t really come from a culture that supports women in talking about sexual harassment, in my &#8212; in my experience, that is. And, you know, I just haven&#8217;t felt like it was something I was going to get support on&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> You know, how long&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> &#8230; in the bigger picture.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p>How long did this feeling last? Or, I guess, what are the longer-term ripple effects here? Did it shake your confidence in your abilities?</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> I think it did. I think it did. I think it did.</p>\n<p>I think it made me feel like, wow, you know, that was a wash. He wasn&#8217;t interested at all in what I had to say, or, you know, he didn&#8217;t see any talent there or intellect there. He was assessing the situation the whole time for something else.</p>\n<p>And I think that &#8212; that did hurt. You know, I wish it didn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> But he had produced so many movies that I thought were wonderful. And it was &#8212; it&#8217;s hard when someone has made art that you love, and how do you stay attached to liking their art, but feeling conflicted about them?</p>\n<p>And, yes, I think it does have long-term effects. I think you tuck it away. And then, for me, also, I realized that it came back when I would see his name or see him in person. I would start to sort of tremble all over again.</p>\n<p>I mean, I wouldn&#8217;t think about him on a daily basis or anything for years, and then I would see him, and I would think, oh, I don&#8217;t feel well. I got to get out of here.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Right.</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> You know, it would bring up so much emotion.</p>\n<p>And the most recent one was the woman in New York, the Italian model. I felt so, so enraged when I saw what happened there, and that they sort of &#8212; the police had him, and that then he got away. And then she was being dragged through the press as somebody who just, you know, wanted a payout, et cetera.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> You know, in the wake of that, there was &#8212; a friend of yours had tweeted, &#8220;At some point, all the women who have been afraid to speak out about Harvey Weinstein are going to have to hold hands and jump.&#8221; This was back in 2015.</p>\n<p>And from your Twitter account, you said, &#8220;Agreed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It seemed like you almost had the opportunity to come forward.</p>\n<p>What made you want to come forward now? Has this become a turning point in the industry?</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> This is a turning point. It&#8217;s a turning point.</p>\n<p>There are so many times when I thought about it, and then felt like &#8212; there were times when I thought about it and said, well, I have nothing to lose, I will just do it. And then I thought, I &#8212; I just didn&#8217;t have the strength or the courage yet.</p>\n<p>And I think somebody like Jodi Kantor doing the story for The New York Times, the fact that she thought it was a story at all was startling to me and made me feel like, wow, something is going to be done.</p>\n<p>And I knew she had told me &#8212; I mean, they were looking for women that this had happened to, because they&#8217;d been hearing rumors for so long that it happened to so many people. And she had told me other people were coming out.</p>\n<p>And I thought, I can&#8217;t &#8212; when I watched Rose McGowan or any of the other actresses come forward, I just &#8212; or Ashley Judd &#8212; I just thought, they look strong to me, and I don&#8217;t want to be the one that stays silent.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Well, Katherine Kendall&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> I want to stand beside them.</p>\n<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Katherine Kendall, thank you very much for speaking with us.</p>\n<p>And, hopefully, there are other people that are empowered by you coming forward.</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> I hope so. Thank you.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/escaping-harvey-weinstein-cat-mouse-game-says-katherine-kendall/\">Escaping Harvey Weinstein was a \u2018cat-and-mouse game,\u2019 says Katherine Kendall</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour\">PBS NewsHour</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\t\r\n\r\n\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/escaping-harvey-weinstein-cat-mouse-game-says-katherine-kendall/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t<enclosure url=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/20171018_EscapingHarveyWeinstein.mp3\" length=\"15000000\" type=\"audio/mpeg\" /> <itunes:duration>8:18</itunes:duration> <itunes:summary>More than three dozen women have now come forward to say Harvey Weinstein harassed or assaulted them.

Photo by REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz</p></div>\n<p>In America, there\u2019s a significant kind of public insistence that one\u2019s \u201cfreedom\u201d is fundamentally tied to one\u2019s wealth.</p>\n<p>Much of the country views America through an aspirational and transformative lens, a colorblind and bias-free utopia, wherein wealth conveys equality and acts as a panacea for social and racial ills. Once an individual achieves massive financial success, or so the message goes, he or she will \u201ctranscend\u201d the scourge of economic and racial inequality, truly becoming \u201cfree.\u201d</p>\n<p>Working in parallel with this reverence for this colorblind version of the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d is the belief that economic privilege mandates patriotic gratitude. Across industries and disciplines, Americans are told to love their nation uncritically, be thankful that they are exceptional enough to live in a country that allows citizens the opportunity to reach astronomical heights of economic prosperity.</p>\n<p>For the nation\u2019s black citizens, there\u2019s often an additional racialized presumption lurking under the surface of these concepts: the notion that black success and wealth demands public silence on systemic issues of inequality and oppression.</p>\n<div class='nhpullquote right'>One&#8217;s economic privilege is a lousy barrier against discrimination and oppression.</div>\n<p>These are durable and fragile ideologies that prop up the concept of the American Dream \u2013 durable because they are encoded in the very fabric of American culture (most Americans, including African Americans, have readily embraced these ideologies as assumed facts); yet fragile because it\u2019s all too easy to see that\u00a0one&#8217;s economic privilege is a lousy barrier against both individual and systemic discrimination and oppression.</p>\n<p>Consequently, black people have also been among the most vocal challengers of these ideologies, as we\u2019ve seen most recently with the Colin Kaepernick and the NFL #TakeAKnee demonstrations. In a show of solidary with the free agent quarterback, professional football players \u2013 the vast majority of whom are black \u2013 have been kneeling during the National Anthem as a means of protesting racial injustice and police brutality.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/nfl-players-team-defiance-solidarity/\">WATCH:\u00a0NFL players team up in defiance and solidarity</a></strong></p>\n<p>Over the past few weeks, the president of the United States has brought renewed attention to the inherent tensions that define the ideologies of the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d through his repeated public criticisms of these kneeling NFL players.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues,\u201d Trump recently tweeted, he or she should not be allowed to kneel. Labeling the protestors actions \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to the country, flag and anthem, President Donald Trump has called for players to be fired, encouraged a boycott of the NFL, insisted that the league pass a rule mandating that players stand for the anthem and derided the protestors as \u201csons of bitches.\u201d</p>\n<p>In a dramatic ploy more befitting of a scripted reality television show, the president gloated that he had instructed Vice President Mike Pence to walk out of an Indianapolis Colts game the moment any player kneeled. This was an orchestrated show of power and outrage, designed to send a flamboyant political message given that Trump and Pence knew in advance that on that particular day, the Colts were playing the San Francisco 49ers \u2013 the team that currently has the most protestors.

Once an individual achieves massive financial success, or so the message goes, he or she will \u201ctranscend\u201d the scourge of economic and racial inequality, truly becoming \u201cfree.\u201d</p>\n<p>Working in parallel with this reverence for this colorblind version of the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d is the belief that economic privilege mandates patriotic gratitude. Across industries and disciplines, Americans are told to love their nation uncritically, be thankful that they are exceptional enough to live in a country that allows citizens the opportunity to reach astronomical heights of economic prosperity.</p>\n<p>For the nation\u2019s black citizens, there\u2019s often an additional racialized presumption lurking under the surface of these concepts: the notion that black success and wealth demands public silence on systemic issues of inequality and oppression.</p>\n<div class='nhpullquote right'>One&#8217;s economic privilege is a lousy barrier against discrimination and oppression.</div>\n<p>These are durable and fragile ideologies that prop up the concept of the American Dream \u2013 durable because they are encoded in the very fabric of American culture (most Americans, including African Americans, have readily embraced these ideologies as assumed facts); yet fragile because it\u2019s all too easy to see that\u00a0one&#8217;s economic privilege is a lousy barrier against both individual and systemic discrimination and oppression.</p>\n<p>Consequently, black people have also been among the most vocal challengers of these ideologies, as we\u2019ve seen most recently with the Colin Kaepernick and the NFL #TakeAKnee demonstrations. In a show of solidary with the free agent quarterback, professional football players \u2013 the vast majority of whom are black \u2013 have been kneeling during the National Anthem as a means of protesting racial injustice and police brutality.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/nfl-players-team-defiance-solidarity/\">WATCH:\u00a0NFL players team up in defiance and solidarity</a></strong></p>\n<p>Over the past few weeks, the president of the United States has brought renewed attention to the inherent tensions that define the ideologies of the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d through his repeated public criticisms of these kneeling NFL players.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues,\u201d Trump recently tweeted, he or she should not be allowed to kneel. Labeling the protestors actions \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to the country, flag and anthem, President Donald Trump has called for players to be fired, encouraged a boycott of the NFL, insisted that the league pass a rule mandating that players stand for the anthem and derided the protestors as \u201csons of bitches.\u201d</p>\n<p>In a dramatic ploy more befitting of a scripted reality television show, the president gloated that he had instructed Vice President Mike Pence to walk out of an Indianapolis Colts game the moment any player kneeled. This was an orchestrated show of power and outrage, designed to send a flamboyant political message given that Trump and Pence knew in advance that on that particular day, the Colts were playing the San Francisco 49ers \u2013 the team that currently has the most protestors. The NFL\u2019s announcement this week that the league has no plans to penalize protesting players is the most recent event to provoke the president\u2019s fury; taking to social media during the early morning, he once again equated kneeling with \u201ctotal disrespect\u201d for our country.</p>\n<p>As many have pointed out, the president\u2019s moralizing outrage toward the NFL players is selective and deeply flawed \u2013 his apparent patriotic loyalty hasn\u2019t stopped the billionaire politician from criticizing the removal of Confederate statues, or attacking a Gold Star family, or mocking Sen.

They are often together on trips, at the White House, or at the observatory, almost always holding hands.</p>\n<p>Since returning to Washington in January (the family lived in the area when her husband served in Congress), she has accompanied the vice president on goodwill tours of Europe, Asia and Latin America, as well as trips to survey recent hurricane damage in Texas, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. She tries to visit art therapy programs wherever she goes. Journalists who travel with Pence often keep an eye out for his wife; she often brings them cookies when he ventures back to the press cabin for small talk.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/devastated-puerto-rico-needs-unprecedented-aid-says-governor/\"><strong>READ MORE: Devastated Puerto Rico needs unprecedented aid, says governor</strong></a></p>\n<p>She&#8217;s even done a little campaigning, urging Virginians to vote next month for Ed Gillespie in what&#8217;s viewed as a tight gubernatorial race.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It really makes a difference, I can tell you. Nobody thought that we were going to win,&#8221; she said, an apparent reference to the Trump-Pence ticket.</p>\n<p>The vice president often refers to his wife as the family&#8217;s &#8220;prayer captain.&#8221; She has led congregations in prayer during their hurricane-damage trips.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re people of faith so we just try and approach everything with prayer,&#8221; Mrs. Pence said from her sunny, second-floor office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in the White House complex, where she and her staff enjoy coveted views of the Washington Monument and Jefferson Memorial. Art therapy drawings given as gifts adorn the outer office.</p>\n<p>She proudly displayed several of her paintings, including of the Capitol dome, the vice president&#8217;s residence, a Ball canning jar-turned-flower vase, a cardinal bird and a pink peony. She turns many of her watercolors into prints and boxed notecards that she gifts to art therapists she meets.</p>\n<p>Except for myriad pets, including two cats, a dog and a rabbit named Marlon Bundo, the Pences are empty nesters. Their son and two adult daughters are off on their own.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think for us this is a good time in our life for this role because our kids are out of college.

They are often together on trips, at the White House, or at the observatory, almost always holding hands.</p>\n<p>Since returning to Washington in January (the family lived in the area when her husband served in Congress), she has accompanied the vice president on goodwill tours of Europe, Asia and Latin America, as well as trips to survey recent hurricane damage in Texas, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. She tries to visit art therapy programs wherever she goes. Journalists who travel with Pence often keep an eye out for his wife; she often brings them cookies when he ventures back to the press cabin for small talk.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/devastated-puerto-rico-needs-unprecedented-aid-says-governor/\"><strong>READ MORE: Devastated Puerto Rico needs unprecedented aid, says governor</strong></a></p>\n<p>She&#8217;s even done a little campaigning, urging Virginians to vote next month for Ed Gillespie in what&#8217;s viewed as a tight gubernatorial race.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It really makes a difference, I can tell you. Nobody thought that we were going to win,&#8221; she said, an apparent reference to the Trump-Pence ticket.</p>\n<p>The vice president often refers to his wife as the family&#8217;s &#8220;prayer captain.&#8221; She has led congregations in prayer during their hurricane-damage trips.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re people of faith so we just try and approach everything with prayer,&#8221; Mrs. Pence said from her sunny, second-floor office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in the White House complex, where she and her staff enjoy coveted views of the Washington Monument and Jefferson Memorial. Art therapy drawings given as gifts adorn the outer office.</p>\n<p>She proudly displayed several of her paintings, including of the Capitol dome, the vice president&#8217;s residence, a Ball canning jar-turned-flower vase, a cardinal bird and a pink peony. She turns many of her watercolors into prints and boxed notecards that she gifts to art therapists she meets.</p>\n<p>Except for myriad pets, including two cats, a dog and a rabbit named Marlon Bundo, the Pences are empty nesters. Their son and two adult daughters are off on their own.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think for us this is a good time in our life for this role because our kids are out of college. They&#8217;re living their own lives,&#8221; Mrs. Pence said.</p>\n<p>She&#8217;s also launching a blog in conjunction with Wednesday&#8217;s announcement to chronicle her visits to art therapy programs.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/karen-pence-outline-goals-art-therapy-initiative/\">Karen Pence to outline goals for art therapy initiative</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour\">PBS NewsHour</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\t\r\n\r\n\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/karen-pence-outline-goals-art-therapy-initiative/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t <itunes:summary>WASHINGTON \u2014 When Karen Pence found out that an art therapist in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico couldn't afford the clay her clients needed, she sprang into action.</itunes:summary>\t<media:content url=\"http://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/RTS120EL-1024x683.jpg\" medium=\"image\" />\r\n\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>News Wrap: Trump\u2019s latest travel ban blocked by federal judge</title>\r\n\t\t<link>http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/news-wrap-trumps-latest-travel-ban-blocked-federal-judge/</link>\r\n\t\t<comments>http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/news-wrap-trumps-latest-travel-ban-blocked-federal-judge/#respond</comments>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2017 22:45:01 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[PBS NewsHour]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Hawaii]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tom Marino]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[travel ban]]></category>\r\n\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/?post_type=bb&amp;p=230958</guid>\r\n\r\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p><img width=\"200\" height=\"160\" src=\"http://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/RTX3H1N3-200x160.jpg\" class=\"attachment-200x160 size-200x160 wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" /></p><p><a href=\"http://video.pbs.org/video/3005759068/\">Watch Video</a> | <a href=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/20171017_NewsWrap.mp3\">Listen to the Audio</a></p><p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> And in the day&#8217;s other news: A federal judge in Hawaii struck down the Trump administration&#8217;s latest travel ban.</p>\n<p>That temporarily blocks enforcement of the order nationwide, but the Justice Department says it will appeal.

The island and its residents are still coming to grips with the scale of the devastation.</p>\n<p>William Brangham brings us the latest.</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> Many Puerto Ricans are still in the dark, without electrical power. Hundreds of thousands still have no access to running water, and the rebuilding of the countless damaged homes, roads and facilities is just beginning.</p>\n<p>The Associated Press reported yesterday that almost half the sewage treatment plants on the island are still out of service, increasing the risk of contamination and disease.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m joined now by David Begnaud. He&#8217;s a correspondent from CBS News who&#8217;s been doing some very strong reporting there from since when the storm hit, and is just back from his latest trip to the island.</p>\n<p>David, welcome to the NewsHour.</p>\n<p>I wonder. We saw many of your reports and others of people still three weeks out from the storm who are still drinking from streams and creeks. You heard &#8212; I mentioned this AP report about fears of contamination.</p>\n<p>Can you just tell us what is going on there? How are people getting water now?</p>\n<p><strong>DAVID BEGNAUD,</strong> CBS News: Well, let me tell you this.</p>\n<p>The governor of Puerto Rico said this morning that he&#8217;s aware of those reports and that they&#8217;re looking into it. What&#8217;s concerning, William, is that three weeks after the storm and at least a week after the allegations first surfaced that people might be trying to drink from toxic wells at what&#8217;s known as Superfund sites, the governor of Puerto Rico is still saying, we&#8217;re looking into it and telling people to stay out of rivers where sewage may be spilling into the river.</p>\n<p>And, he said, we want them to stay away from the coastal areas.</p>\n<p>How are people doing? They&#8217;re still desperate to get water. No one seems to be able to figure out how to get enough water to every single person on that island who needs it. And as long as people need water, it&#8217;s still an emergency phase.</p>\n<p>Nearly four weeks later, no one seems to be able to move from the emergency to the recovery.</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> So, people who are &#8212; we see them drinking out of these PVC pipes that they have kind of rigged and sort of poked into the side of a creek.</p>\n<p>People are just drinking that water straight, without purification, without boiling it; is that right?</p>\n<p><strong>DAVID BEGNAUD:</strong> Absolutely.</p>\n<p>Look, they have got the PVC pipes tapped into the mountains so that it&#8217;s coming out of the stream that way. And they literally are &#8212; I saw a woman walk up to a potable water tank that the military had brought in, and she had a Clorox bottle.</p>\n<p>And I said, &#8220;Ma&#8217;am, you&#8217;re putting drinkable water in a Clorox bottle?&#8221;</p>\n<p>And she said, &#8220;It&#8217;s all I have got.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Now, that was a good scenario. The other scenarios are people right now who are drinking from streams and creeks and rivers who have no water filters, who have nothing, right? They&#8217;re just taking this water.</p>\n<p>Now, listen, the government got a million water-purifying tablets within the last week. It took almost three weeks to get those. Now there&#8217;s a large push to bring in water filters.</p>\n<p>I have got to tell you, most of the water filters I&#8217;m seeing brought in are coming from the private sector, and civilian samaritans who are getting 1,000 or more from the mainland and flying them over to Puerto Rico and personally hand-delivering them.</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> That&#8217;s really incredible.</p>\n<p>Medical facilities were another big &#8212; just a huge devastation on the island. I know you have been doing a lot of reporting on the USS Comfort.</p>\n<p><strong>DAVID BEGNAUD:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> This is the huge Naval hospital that is now just offshore Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>But I understand it hasn&#8217;t been fully utilized. Can you tell us what your reporting has found there?</p>\n<p><strong>DAVID BEGNAUD:</strong> The two men running the ship told us that nearly 87 percent of the ship is empty. Sounds alarming, right? They have 200 beds, and 87 percent are empty.</p>\n<p>Now, here&#8217;s what they said: We stand ready for whatever the government wants to do. We are waiting to be told by the government.</p>\n<p>So, I went to the governor, and said exactly what&#8217;s happening. And he said: &#8220;Look, I&#8217;m not satisfied with what the protocol was from the beginning.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He said, initially, they were prioritizing only the most critically ill patients go to the Comfort. And he said there was a layered process that was complicating things.</p>\n<p>So, the governor, Ricardo Rossello, said: &#8220;I started to take out some of those layers, and I, said, listen, take people on the ship who may not be critically ill, but need good medical care and can&#8217;t get it at the hospital, where the lights are flickering and the A.C. is not running.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what the governor said.</p>\n<p>Within a matter of hours, I got a tweet from a third-year medical student who said: &#8220;Let me tell you what a nightmare it has been to reach the Comfort.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He said: &#8220;We have got a pediatric patient who desperately needs to get off this island, either to a hospital on the mainland or to the Comfort.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And he said: &#8220;I went through Google and the local newspaper to find the number. I couldn&#8217;t find it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Now, here is how things work. Within about 30 minutes of that tweet going out and that medical student&#8217;s story being posted, the governor&#8217;s spokesperson responded with numbers that should be able to help.</p>\n<p>The bottom line here, William, is that asking relentless questions and the good work of journalism is what&#8217;s making a difference there. It&#8217;s no one person. There&#8217;s no heroic work that&#8217;s being done by any journalist, other than people who are going back to the same officials and asking some of the same questions, relentlessly seeking the right answer that will make a difference.</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> One of the other pieces of reporting that you did that was very early in the story was this backlog of supplies trapped in container ships on the ports in Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>I understand some of that &#8212; some of those supplies are now moving. Can you tell us, are they getting to where they need to be throughout the island?</p>\n<p><strong>DAVID BEGNAUD:</strong> So, the shipping containers you&#8217;re talking about, about 3,000 sitting in the Port of San Juan, have been moved out, not all of them, but a majority of them.</p>\n<p>And they were intended for grocery stores around the island. Right? So, those were private companies that had brought in these shipping containers, paid for the supplies, but couldn&#8217;t move them because their truck drivers were either at home, because the home had been destroyed, or the road was impassable.</p>\n<p>More and more supplies are getting out. But let me tell you, the grocery stores around the island, they have a lot of nonperishables, Pringles, candy, cookies, all on the shelf.</p>\n<p>But when you go to the meat section, it&#8217;s nearly 75 percent empty at the stores we have been to, the produce section 90 percent empty. And finding bottled water there is almost like playing a game.</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> David Begnaud, CBS News, thank you so much for your reporting.

The hashtag was tweeted nearly a million times in just 48 hours. Facebook reported 45 percent of its users have friends who posted #MeToo, as women wrote about their experiences about the workplace and culture, and what should change.</p>\n<p>We explore some of those issues with Fatima Goss Graves. She&#8217;s president of the National Women&#8217;s Law Center. Lisa Senecal wrote about her own experience for the online news site Daily Beast. She&#8217;s with the Vermont Commission on Women. And Melissa Silverstein is the founder of the blog and Web site Women and Hollywood.</p>\n<p>Thank you all for joining us.</p>\n<p>Lisa Senecal, I&#8217;m going to start with you.</p>\n<p>You have had a personal experience with sexual harassment. That&#8217;s in part what has drawn you to this #MeToo campaign movement.</p>\n<p>Just tell us briefly about what happened.</p>\n<p><strong>LISA SENECAL,</strong> Member, Vermont Commission on Women: Sure.</p>\n<p>Like most women, I have had a number of experiences with sexual harassment, beginning with my first job, when I was 15 years old. And it&#8217;s really been a threat off and on throughout my entire professional career.</p>\n<p>The most egregious offense was an actual assault that occurred with a male executive. Unfortunately, because of an NDA &#8212; and we can go into the evils of nondisclosures another time &#8212; but because of that, there isn&#8217;t a lot that I&#8217;m able to say about the specific event.</p>\n<p>But the issue of sexual harassment and finally having this come to the fore, so many women are already familiar with it from being on the receiving end. And I think, especially with the #MeToo campaign, it&#8217;s been really wonderful and an eye-opening experience for men to realize just how pervasive an issue this is.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> So, in your experience, it was a business setting.</p>\n<p>Melissa Silverstein, you have been writing about women in Hollywood for 10 years. Of course, that&#8217;s where the Harvey Weinstein story came from.</p>\n<p>If it&#8217;s been going on in Hollywood forever, why hasn&#8217;t it been talked about more before now?</p>\n<p><strong>MELISSA SILVERSTEIN,</strong> Founder, Women and Hollywood: Well, I think there was a culture of silence created around this man and also within this industry.</p>\n<p>People were afraid. People are afraid for their jobs. It&#8217;s a very relational industry, where if someone is going to blacklist you, you are not going to get your next job.</p>\n<p>So I think the way that a person was able to conduct himself for 30 years like this was to build a culture of fear, to make people sign nondisclosure agreements, and to get them to shut up.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Fatima Goss Graves, here with me in Washington with the National Women&#8217;s Law Center, we have been talking about Hollywood.</p>\n<p>We have talking about the business workplace. Is there any field of work where this isn&#8217;t going on?</p>\n<p><strong>FATIMA GOSS GRAVES,</strong> President, National Women&#8217;s Law Center: Right.</p>\n<p>The issue of harassment and assault, it&#8217;s a Hollywood problem, but really it&#8217;s an everywhere problem. It infects industries across the board, whether you&#8217;re high-wage jobs, low-wage jobs, male-dominated fields, but also female-dominated fields.</p>\n<p>Restaurants are some of the areas where you have some of the highest rates of EEOC charges. And that&#8217;s not a male-dominated field.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> EEOC, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>\n<p>Lisa Senecal, some people are saying that they&#8217;re uncomfortable with this #MeToo campaign movement because they&#8217;re saying, once again, women are being asked to go public with what happened to them, but there is no promise that there is going to be anything done about it. How do you see this?</p>\n<p><strong>LISA SENECAL:</strong> I don&#8217;t necessarily believe that women are being asked to come forward.</p>\n<p>I think this is an opportunity to come forward, if that&#8217;s something that women want to do, but there&#8217;s no obligation to do it. And there&#8217;s been a lot of support for letting women know that if this isn&#8217;t something you&#8217;re comfortable with at this time, no one is obligated to tell their story, and no one is allowed to force you to tell your story before you&#8217;re ready.</p>\n<p>But the stories are important. Without them, the degree to which this happens across all industries, across genders as well &#8212; we know that this happens to men. This happens to the transgender.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not specific to women, although it affects us most frequently. Until we have a critical mass of women who are able to get the men in their lives, the men that they work with to understand how pervasive a problem it is, and then can get men to begin to act on this, because this isn&#8217;t a women&#8217;s issue.</p>\n<p>This is a violence issue, and an issue of power and who has the power. So until the people who still primarily do hold the power, which is primarily men and primarily white men, until they&#8217;re going to begin to act, then the problems are going to persist.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Melissa Silverstein, how do you see that? What is it going to take for this to be a change?</p>\n<p><strong>MELISSA SILVERSTEIN:</strong> The fact that we&#8217;re having a global conversation about sexual harassment &#8212; I have been doing media for the last week all over the world.</p>\n<p>People are really enthralled by this and want to see change. This is a global issue. And, also, Hollywood is a global industry. Seventy cents of every dollar of Hollywood studio movies are made outside the United States.</p>\n<p>So what people are looking for is Hollywood to step up. And, today, we had a leader in Hollywood, Kathleen Kennedy, to say we need to have a commission, cross-industry commission, of people who are going to look into this and put a stop to it once and for all.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> And pick up on that, Fatima Goss Graves. Just across the board, what is it going to take?</p>\n<p><strong>FATIMA GOSS GRAVES:</strong> Right.</p>\n<p>We know that there are things that would make a difference here. If employers had processes that their employees actually use, you wouldn&#8217;t have harassment in the shadows. Right now, most people don&#8217;t report harassment to anyone. And it&#8217;s because they think their employers won&#8217;t do anything, or, worse, that they would experience retaliation.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> And that&#8217;s &#8212; because that&#8217;s been what happened.</p>\n<p><strong>FATIMA GOSS GRAVES:</strong> And that is. They&#8217;re right to believe that they will experience retaliation, because they do. They&#8217;re shamed. They&#8217;re blamed.</p>\n<p>But employees could make a difference. Right? They can be &#8212; take it seriously and communicate that to their workplace. They can also have the right policies that are in place. And, finally, they could, when someone comes forward, be really clear that they take it seriously and that they will not tolerate retaliation.</p>\n<p>Those are things that aren&#8217;t happening among employers frequently enough.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Lisa Senecal, as somebody who had it happen to you in a business environment, what changes need to be made in the workplace? What has to happen?</p>\n<p><strong>LISA SENECAL:</strong> Well, I agree completely with what was just said.</p>\n<p>Too often, the workplace education that goes on is incredibly insufficient. It&#8217;s more of companies wanting to be able to check the box and say that they did their sexual harassment training. And it isn&#8217;t truly something within the culture of companies that they believe that this is a problem and that it is a right of all people working at that company not to be harassed.</p>\n<p>So, until it starts to be taken more seriously, and when a woman or anyone comes forward with an accusation, it does have to be taken so much more seriously. And the knee-jerk response, as was in my case, cannot be to shame the woman, can&#8217;t be to blame her for somehow bringing this on herself, and putting women back in a position of being victimized a second time because they&#8217;re not taken seriously when they come forward.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Melissa Silverstein, yes, go ahead.</p>\n<p><strong>MELISSA SILVERSTEIN:</strong> I just wanted to add, one of the things that&#8217;s so fundamental about this is how this &#8212; how it&#8217;s so normalized for all of us to go through this kind of harassment, especially in Hollywood, and how people kind of laugh off, oh, you know, that&#8217;s locker room talk, or, you know, this is the movie business, get used to it.</p>\n<p>And what we need to do is really pierce that veil of the normalization of this kind of conduct, because it starts with, you know, the comments, and then it can escalate very quickly.</p>\n<p>So we really need to just change people&#8217;s attitudes and get rid of the toxic masculinity. Hollywood has no much institutionalized sexism that sometimes I feel like we need to just start over, if possible.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Joining us also is Leigh Gilmore, a professor at Wellesley College who&#8217;s written a book about why &#8212; titled &#8220;Why We Doubt What Women Say About Their Lives.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Leigh Gilmore, why don&#8217;t women &#8212; why haven&#8217;t women been believed and taken seriously on this, and could we now be at a moment when they are?</p>\n<p><strong>LEIGH GILMORE,</strong> Wellesley College: It&#8217;s good to be with you, Judy.</p>\n<p>I think we have a persistent and a pervasive culture of doubting what women say, especially when they&#8217;re bringing forward accounts of harm into the public sphere. So we have these pre-made default cultural narratives of women&#8217;s unreliability. We have he said/she said, which is a false equivalence narrative.</p>\n<p>We have that notion that nobody knows what really happened. We have that notion that you can&#8217;t really trust what women say. None of these are based in fact, but they are part of a kind of cloud that enables us to doubt any woman before she speaks up.</p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s quite intimidating. And so, if we&#8217;re at a point of change, we really are at a moment where I think we have a new level of visibility, and we have the opportunity to amplify the voices of women who are speaking out.</p>\n<p>So, insofar as we have that opportunity, there is a form of solidarity, and more women speaking can lead to change.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Fatima Goss Graves, as somebody who works on these issues from a legal standpoint, are we, could we be at a watershed point, or is it just a whole lot more complicated?</p>\n<p><strong>FATIMA GOSS GRAVES:</strong> Well, the culture change typically has to go together with both the enforcement of the laws and the policy change.</p>\n<p>And so we&#8217;re at a tipping point, surely, on culture change. But I will tell you, you know, the National Women&#8217;s Law Center runs a hot line. And over the last two weeks, we have had double the intake on harassment.</p>\n<p>And we have a new network called the Legal Network for Gender Equity, so we&#8217;re &#8212; attorneys are joining with us and will be ready to take these cases. But those people who are making these calls and contacting us, I think that that shows that you have people who are ready to come forward on social media, and there is power there, but it seems like there are people who are ready to come forward in other ways, too.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> I want to quickly go around and ask each one of you about the role of men in all of this.</p>\n<p>Lisa Senecal?</p>\n<p><strong>LISA SENECAL:</strong> Oh, I think it&#8217;s critical for men as allies to be coming forward and supporting women who do come forward.</p>\n<p>Men also need to be willing to call out other men, whether that&#8217;s one-on-one, whether it&#8217;s in a group setting within a company, or socially. If a man hears, sees someone doing something inappropriate, they need to have the courage to stand up, even in front of other men, and say, it&#8217;s not OK, it&#8217;s inappropriate behavior, and it&#8217;s not going to be tolerated.</p>\n<p>And until it&#8217;s also men joining in, women can&#8217;t do this by themselves. There is an organization, A Call to Men, that I&#8217;m a big fan of. And one of their mantras is, if women could have stopped abuse and assault, they would have done it already.</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s completely true. It&#8217;s not something that women are going to be able to do alone. It shouldn&#8217;t be looked at as only a women&#8217;s issue. And until people look at this on a larger scale and understand that this affects the bottom line of companies, it affects productivity, it affects, you know, absenteeism, just across the board, this is not a women&#8217;s issue.</p>\n<p>It is a human issue.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Right.</p>\n<p>Melissa Silverstein, what about that?</p>\n<p>And we should point out that men are themselves the victims of sexual harassment and abuse at times.</p>\n<p><strong>MELISSA SILVERSTEIN:</strong> I feel that this is on men.</p>\n<p>The men are most of the perpetrators. They&#8217;re also the collaborators. And, at The Weinstein Company, their board was all men, and they were all complicit in creating an environment that allowed this to thrive.</p>\n<p>In Hollywood, there&#8217;s not a single woman, even the people at the tippy-top of the industry, who don&#8217;t report to men. This is also about getting more women into leadership positions and getting the men &#8212; and holding the men accountable.</p>\n<p>The men in this industry need to step up. They need to say, we want to be &#8212; we want to create this industry in a way that women can thrive and don&#8217;t have to experience this anymore.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Leigh Gilmore?</p>\n<p><strong>LEIGH GILMORE:</strong> We&#8217;re talking about awareness and accountability.</p>\n<p>So, as wonderful as it is to have increased visibility, and it enables us to connect the dots and to see the long histories of sexual abuse, harassment and discrimination, we need new levels of accountability.</p>\n<p>I will echo the notion that Harvey Weinstein&#8217;s board certainly knew about these accusations. There&#8217;s a DA who failed to charge him. We have ample examples of failures.</p>\n<p>And what we really need to do is to correct those. The role of men is certainly important here. Minimally, they can show up and be witnesses.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> And, finally, Fatima Goss Graves, the role of men and how we prevent this.</p>\n<p><strong>FATIMA GOSS GRAVES:</strong> We have had a little bit of conversation about men as survivors, but the conversation we haven&#8217;t really had is about what happens when men are abusers or enablers or allow this to happen in the workplaces, in schools, or in women&#8217;s everyday lives?</p>\n<p>And so now we have an opportunity culturally for that conversation. That culture is going to have to hit where policy-makers are. It&#8217;s going to have to hit where employers are in order to make a real difference.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Well, it&#8217;s clear that everyone is hoping this is a watershed moment, that things will change as a result of what&#8217;s happened here. But we will see.</p>\n<p>And we appreciate all of you joining us in this conversation, Fatima Goss Graves here with me in Washington, Lisa Senecal, Melissa Silverstein, and Leigh Gilmore.</p>\n<p>We thank you all.</p>\n<p><strong>FATIMA GOSS GRAVES:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n<p><strong>MELISSA SILVERSTEIN:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/survivors-say-metoo-will-take-stop-widespread-sexual-harassment/\">As survivors say #MeToo, what will it take to stop widespread sexual harassment?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour\">PBS NewsHour</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe class='partnerPlayer' frameborder='0' marginwidth='0' marginheight='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' src='http://player.pbs.org/widget/partnerplayer/3005771611/?start=0&end=0&chapterbar=false&endscreen=false' allowfullscreen></iframe><p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> The hashtag #MeToo has millions of women sharing stories of abuse, shining a spotlight on a troubling reality in our society.</p>\n<p>It was first used in 2007, but when actor Alyssa Milano tweeted it Sunday night to talk about sexual harassment and assault in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein story, it went viral. The hashtag was tweeted nearly a million times in just 48 hours. Facebook reported 45 percent of its users have friends who posted #MeToo, as women wrote about their experiences about the workplace and culture, and what should change.</p>\n<p>We explore some of those issues with Fatima Goss Graves. She&#8217;s president of the National Women&#8217;s Law Center. Lisa Senecal wrote about her own experience for the online news site Daily Beast. She&#8217;s with the Vermont Commission on Women. And Melissa Silverstein is the founder of the blog and Web site Women and Hollywood.</p>\n<p>Thank you all for joining us.</p>\n<p>Lisa Senecal, I&#8217;m going to start with you.</p>\n<p>You have had a personal experience with sexual harassment. That&#8217;s in part what has drawn you to this #MeToo campaign movement.</p>\n<p>Just tell us briefly about what happened.</p>\n<p><strong>LISA SENECAL,</strong> Member, Vermont Commission on Women: Sure.</p>\n<p>Like most women, I have had a number of experiences with sexual harassment, beginning with my first job, when I was 15 years old. And it&#8217;s really been a threat off and on throughout my entire professional career.</p>\n<p>The most egregious offense was an actual assault that occurred with a male executive. Unfortunately, because of an NDA &#8212; and we can go into the evils of nondisclosures another time &#8212; but because of that, there isn&#8217;t a lot that I&#8217;m able to say about the specific event.</p>\n<p>But the issue of sexual harassment and finally having this come to the fore, so many women are already familiar with it from being on the receiving end. And I think, especially with the #MeToo campaign, it&#8217;s been really wonderful and an eye-opening experience for men to realize just how pervasive an issue this is.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> So, in your experience, it was a business setting.</p>\n<p>Melissa Silverstein, you have been writing about women in Hollywood for 10 years. Of course, that&#8217;s where the Harvey Weinstein story came from.</p>\n<p>If it&#8217;s been going on in Hollywood forever, why hasn&#8217;t it been talked about more before now?</p>\n<p><strong>MELISSA SILVERSTEIN,</strong> Founder, Women and Hollywood: Well, I think there was a culture of silence created around this man and also within this industry.</p>\n<p>People were afraid. People are afraid for their jobs. It&#8217;s a very relational industry, where if someone is going to blacklist you, you are not going to get your next job.</p>\n<p>So I think the way that a person was able to conduct himself for 30 years like this was to build a culture of fear, to make people sign nondisclosure agreements, and to get them to shut up.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Fatima Goss Graves, here with me in Washington with the National Women&#8217;s Law Center, we have been talking about Hollywood.</p>\n<p>We have talking about the business workplace. Is there any field of work where this isn&#8217;t going on?</p>\n<p><strong>FATIMA GOSS GRAVES,</strong> President, National Women&#8217;s Law Center: Right.</p>\n<p>The issue of harassment and assault, it&#8217;s a Hollywood problem, but really it&#8217;s an everywhere problem. It infects industries across the board, whether you&#8217;re high-wage jobs, low-wage jobs, male-dominated fields, but also female-dominated fields.</p>\n<p>Restaurants are some of the areas where you have some of the highest rates of EEOC charges. And that&#8217;s not a male-dominated field.</p>\n<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> EEOC, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>\n<p>Lisa Senecal, some people are saying that they&#8217;re uncomfortable with this #MeToo campaign movement because they&#8217;re saying, once again, women are being asked to go public with what happened to them, but there is no promise that there is going to be anything done about it. How do you see this?</p>\n<p><strong>LISA SENECAL:</strong> I don&#8217;t necessarily believe that women are being asked to come forward.</p>\n<p>I think this is an opportunity to come forward, if that&#8217;s something that women want to do, but there&#8217;s no obligation to do it.

Trump was angered when the soldier&#8217;s father, Khizr Khan, was given a platform to criticize him at the Democratic National Convention.</p>\n<p>Owens&#8217; grieving father said he didn&#8217;t want to talk with Trump at Dover.
