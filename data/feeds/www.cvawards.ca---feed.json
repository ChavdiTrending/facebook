Fans of the Bioshock series will likely find this plot familiar.</p><p>In P.A.M.E.L.A the player\u2019s only goal is to stay alive for as long as possible in NVYVE\u2019s dystopian world.</p><p>We sat down with NVYVE\u2019s Studio\u2019s director, Adam Simonar, to ask him a few questions about his Mississauga-based studio&#8217;s\u2019 first title.</p><p><strong>Question: Can you tell me a little bit about NVYVE Studios?</strong></p><p><strong>Simonar</strong>: NVYVE Studios is a six person development team that branched out from NVYVE, a successful architectural/product visualization company based in Mississauga (that&#8217;s right next to Toronto for non-Greater Toronto Area readers). P.A.M.E.L.A. is our first title and development started around late 2014.</p><p><strong>Question: Are there any particular video games that inspired Pamela&#8217;s development? I&#8217;ve read that the art styles of both Mirror&#8217;s Edge and Mass Effect were big inspirations for your team. Just from watching the trailer, I&#8217;m reminded of Bioshock and even the Deus Ex series. </strong></p><p><strong>Simonar</strong>: Those are all definitely big inspirations. From an artistic standpoint, Mirror&#8217;s Edge and Mass Effect jump out as we&#8217;re going for a very vibrant, clean style for our architecture. And in terms of theme, Bioshock and Deus Ex both feature strong messages about the morality and question-ability of artificial human evolution.</p><p>This is also a central theme to P.A.M.E.L.A. Without giving away too much of the story, the events that unfolded prior to the player waking up in Eden were caused by humanity &#8220;reaching too far,\u201d so to speak. These are all games that we played and loved and that certainly had a big impact on us in terms of shaping the kind of experience we&#8217;re hoping to create.</p><p><strong>Question: What is P.A.M.E.L.A\u2019s story about? Also, just out of curiosity, how did you land on the name &#8220;Pamela?&#8221;</strong></p><p><strong>Simonar</strong>: P.A.M.E.L.A. at its core is a survival horror game; you&#8217;ll be exploring, scavenging and keeping yourself alive in a fallen utopian city. Your main tool to defend yourself with is your AARM, which is a modular piece of equipment that you&#8217;re able to attach different weapons and utility devices to.</p><p>You&#8217;ll also be able to enhance your body at certain locations throughout the city, so these elements come together to form our character progression. As you play, you&#8217;ll be more resilient as well as have access to a greater variety of equipment. The game also features a personality-driven AI system, in which every NPC will have their own tendencies and emotions. They can form their own groups, and will react to the player in different ways depending on how aggressively or peacefully you play the game.</p><p>The name &#8220;PAMELA&#8221; comes from the AI overseer of Eden. She wakes you up into the city after it has fallen, reaching out to you like a last lifeline to humanity. She&#8217;s a companion that will assist you with a variety of abilities as you explore the city.</p><p><strong>Question: From the reveal trailer, the game seems to have an eerie, almost survival horror feel to it. Are you taking that direction with the game?</strong></p><p><strong>Simonar</strong>: That is totally correct! Even though Eden is a beautiful, idealistic utopia, the scenario we&#8217;re creating in the world is very much about tension and unease. We&#8217;re similar to games like The Forest or Day Z in the sense that it&#8217;s not a linear, jump-scare horror experience.</p><p>We&#8217;re building a world where terrible things have happened and it&#8217;s a very dangerous place, so there&#8217;s this sense of wrong-ness and tension that creates most of the horror. The survival aspect is also a huge element in that you&#8217;re scavenging for food and water as well as building new weapons, building items, and more.</p><p><strong>Question: How will Pamela&#8217;s power managing mechanic work? I&#8217;ve seen you discuss it in other interviews I think, but I&#8217;m not sure I completely understand it. </strong></p><p><strong>Simonar</strong>: As you use power in Eden, that area&#8217;s power reserves will slowly deplete. For example keeping the lights on will provide you with enhanced visibility, but will drain power if you never turn the lights off in an area. Energy will slowly regenerate in correspondence with the weather outside, similar to how solar cells would pick up energy from the sun. The goal is to have a nice balance between giving players options, but also making it possible to mess up and be stuck without power, resulting in some tense situations.</p><p><strong>Question: What do you think separates Pamela from other first-person games?</strong></p><p><strong>Simonar</strong>: I think the world itself is a fairly unique aspect of the game; we&#8217;re essentially building an entire utopian sci-fi city that you&#8217;re able to explore, with a huge variety of areas which you would expect to find there.</p><p>Just to list a few, there&#8217;s residential areas, security outposts, shopping areas, research labs, and more, and these areas are all interconnected. We definitely are taking the Elder Scrolls mentality in that you can pick a direction to go, and just keep going to see what you might find past the next area.</p><p><strong>Question: Do you have a target release date? Also, what platforms are you aiming for other than PC?</strong></p><p><strong>Simonar</strong>: We&#8217;re targeting mid-2016 for a PC release on Steam, as well as potentially GOG. We&#8217;re hoping to bring the game to consoles as well, although this will most likely be an after-the-fact port once the PC version is polished and stable.</p><p><strong>Question: Is there anything else you&#8217;d like to mention/discuss about Pamela? </strong></p><p><strong>Simonar</strong>: One thing we were very excited about with our recent &#8220;Rebirth&#8221; trailer, was that we had the opportunity to work with Jeff van Dyck, who was the composer for the Total War series and Audio Director for Alien: Isolation.</p><p>He composed an original theme for the trailer which was amazing and we&#8217;ll be working with him again on some more music to flesh out the world. It was awesome working with Jeff, and it made a huge difference in conveying the mood and story that the trailer focuses on.</p><p><em>P.A.M.E.L.A was recently greenlit on Steam.</em></p><div class=\"ttr_end\"></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.cvawards.ca/gaming-news/nvyve-studios-channels-mass-effect-and-mirrors-edge-with-pamela/\">NVYVE Studios channels Mass Effect and Mirror\u2019s Edge with Pamela</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.cvawards.ca\">CVA 2017</a>.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://www.cvawards.ca/gaming-news/nvyve-studios-channels-mass-effect-and-mirrors-edge-with-pamela/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Crusader of the Lost Idol: Changing the \u2018clicker game\u2019 perception</title><link>http://www.cvawards.ca/gaming-news/crusader-of-the-lost-idol-changing-the-clicker-game-perception/</link> <comments>http://www.cvawards.ca/gaming-news/crusader-of-the-lost-idol-changing-the-clicker-game-perception/#respond</comments> <pubDate>Thu, 04 Feb 2016 16:12:45 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Patrick O'Rourke]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Gaming News]]></category> <category><![CDATA[PC]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Codename Entertainment]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Crusader of the Lost Idol]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.cvawards.ca/?p=2470</guid> <description><![CDATA[<p>Clicker games have a bad reputation, especially in the mobile space, but this is a perception Eric Jordan,Victoria, B.C-based Codename Entertainment\u2019s CEO, want\u2019s to change with his studio\u2019s latest release, ... <br /><a href=\"http://www.cvawards.ca/gaming-news/crusader-of-the-lost-idol-changing-the-clicker-game-perception/\" class=\"more-link\">Read More</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.cvawards.ca/gaming-news/crusader-of-the-lost-idol-changing-the-clicker-game-perception/\">Crusader of the Lost Idol: Changing the \u2018clicker game\u2019 perception</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.cvawards.ca\">CVA 2017</a>.</p> ]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class=\"ttr_start\"></div><p>Clicker games have a bad reputation, especially in the mobile space, but this is a perception Eric Jordan,Victoria, B.C-based <a href=\"http://www.codenameentertainment.com/\">Codename Entertainment\u2019s</a> CEO, want\u2019s to change with his studio\u2019s latest release, <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/402840/\">Crusader of the Lost Idol</a>.</p><p>\u201cClicker games or idle games, are video games whose gameplay consists of the player performing simple actions repeatedly to earn in-game currency. The currency can be used to obtain items or abilities that increase the rate at which currency is earned,\u201d said Jordan</p><p>\u201cThe genre started out as a grassroots commentary by gamers on established franchises where leveling up required repeating certain onerous actions. The earliest versions of clicker games distilled this concept down into simply clicking as the only action needed.\u201d</p><p>With Crusaders of the Lost Idols, Jordan says his studio\u2019s goal was to expand the established \u201cclicker\u201d genre, giving players a gaming experience they might not expect from this type of game.</p><p>\u201cIn the case of Crusaders of the Lost Idols, we wanted to evolve the genre, so we&#8217;ve added unique features that are unavailable in any similar game. This has added a lot of depth and playability which has generated a great response from players and helped build a great community,\u201d said Jordan</p><p>\u201cThe whole team are keen video gamers, tabletop gamers and board gamers and that rubs off on our design approach. The unique formation system we have in the game enables us to introduce the growing roster of characters and each has unique abilities. On top of that, there are a myriad of ways you can combine Crusaders and buffs which creates endless debates amongst our fans on how to best play.\u201d</p><p>LIke other games of this type, Crusaders of the Lost Idols adopts a free-to-play model. Jordan says his team adopted this monetization strategy for two distinct reasons.</p><p>\u201cWe&#8217;ve been using the free-to-play model since the founding of the company seven years ago. We&#8217;re very familiar with the model. It gives us the ability to engage with fans directly. They tell us what they like about the games we make and we iterate and improve them based on that feedback,\u201d said Jordan</p><p>\u201cThe second part of the reason is more a side-effect of the gaming industry\u2019s progression. It&#8217;s almost an expected model, especially amongst younger gamers.\u201d</p><p>According to Jordan, the rise of free-to-play titles has created a free-to-play expectation among younger gamers, one of clicker games\u2019 main demographics. He also says that digital distribution is the future of gaming and the direction the industry is headed.</p><p>\u201cWhen talking with my own 10-year-old son, he&#8217;s almost bewildered why the latest releases require a premium purchase before he can play it,\u201d said Jordan</p><p>Yet a stigma is still attached to the free-to-play genre and many people, especially those that consider themselves serious players, often skip over these titles because they assume the experience they offer isn\u2019t worth their time. However, there are various examples of free-to-play done right in video gaming, with some of the industry\u2019s top titles adopting a free, micro-transaction-focused monetization strategy.</p><p>\u201cWhat about DOTA, League of Legends and Team Fortress 2? Those are free-to-play games that don&#8217;t have a negative stigma. I believe this is because those games aren&#8217;t exploitative,\u201d said Jordan.</p><p>Jordan and his team at Codename Entertainment believe the only way to combat the stigma surrounding free-to-play is to create games they actually want to play themselves.</p><p>\u201cWith that in mind, it&#8217;s a simple step to create games using a free-to-play model that aren&#8217;t exploitative or create negative experiences,\u201d said Jordan</p><p>In Crusaders of the Lost Idols, players can earn premium content in a variety of ways that doesn\u2019t require them to actually spend money. Jordan says that premium content is only presented as an option for players to \u201cenhance their gaming experience because they are already fans.\u201d</p><p>Crusaders of the Lost Idols was nominated for a 2015 Canadian Video Game Award for best social/casual game but didn\u2019t take home the award, losing to I love Potatoes.</p><p>\u201cIt was an enormous honour for the team to be a finalist at the Canadian Video Game Awards this year. The studio has been in operation for seven years and this year&#8217;s nomination was a great way to recognise the talent we have at Codename and the hard work put into making Crusaders,\u201d said Jordan</p><p>While Jordan didn\u2019t go into specifics, he says his studio has plans to bring Crusaders of the Lost Idols to additional platforms, possible even in the mobile space.</p><p>\u201cWe don&#8217;t have anything to announce at this time but it&#8217;s definitely something on our priority list,\u201d said Jordan.</p><div class=\"ttr_end\"></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.cvawards.ca/gaming-news/crusader-of-the-lost-idol-changing-the-clicker-game-perception/\">Crusader of the Lost Idol: Changing the \u2018clicker game\u2019 perception</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.cvawards.ca\">CVA 2017</a>.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://www.cvawards.ca/gaming-news/crusader-of-the-lost-idol-changing-the-clicker-game-perception/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Canadian Video Game Awards Announce 2015 Winners</title><link>http://www.cvawards.ca/cva-2015/canadian-videogame-awards-announce-2015-winners/</link> <pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2015 23:08:30 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Canadian Video Game Awards]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[CVA 2015]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Canadian Video Game Awards]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Canadian Videogame awards]]></category> <category><![CDATA[CVA]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Mattamy Center]]></category> <category><![CDATA[tickets]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Toronto]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Video Game]]></category><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.cvawards.ca/?p=2463</guid> <description><![CDATA[<p>Assassin&#8217;s Creed Syndicate Wins Game of the Year<p><strong>December 7, 2015 (Toronto, ON) \u2013</strong> 2015 winners for the Canadian Video Game Awards were announced yesterday in eighteen different categories.
