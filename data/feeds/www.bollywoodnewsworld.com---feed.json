But not sure about the Kids activities offered by the Resorts and what other things resorts going to offer to make their holiday memorable. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">I think traveling Maldives with kids is not similar to visiting any other countries. Unlike other countries, it is an Island country, almost 300 inhabited islands scattered in many directions, whereas furthermost south and North are approximately 600 KM to each other. No road, no Rail network except seaplane and private speed boat to travel from one place to another. Therefore, getting a medical facility in the resort is like worry free travel especially with a young kid. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">We will answer you every question in this article and provide you a comprehensive list of Resorts offering all sort of facility to parents traveling with children. This island country is famous for private beaches, crystal clear water, water sports, and romance, and considered the hot travel destination in the world. \u00a0</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Frequently question asked: Parents traveling with kids</span></h2>\n<p class=\"p2\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What is the best time to visit Maldives with Kids</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #808080;\">Parents must avoid summer season May to October (Especially with young kid below 18 months) as it is moderately hot (28 to 32 C) \u00a0and tough for a young kid to maintain the hydration level. Although no issue in evening and morning.</span></p>\n<p><strong>What types of food commonly available for kid below 2 years</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #808080;\">Below 2 years can enjoy Milk products, seasonal fruits, and other necessary products for a mini traveler.</span></p>\n<p><strong>What are the common products someone should include in luggage?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #808080;\">Especially you must have general medicines, Electrolyte powder packets, mosquito repellent &amp; cream, cotton clothes, Hats and lots of diapers.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Any other recommendation?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #808080;\">No other stuff required to carry, all resorts located in the Maldives follows the International hospitality standard; therefore you will get everything there.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Good News:</strong> The current scenario in Maldives has completely been changed and most of the world\u2019s top hotel chain includes Kids friendly activities to keep their family guest happy. Resorts offer a club, child care, and all-type-of-food at one place so parents can focus on never ending excursion and aqua life.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Especially there are no activities for a young kid but kids above 3 years may enjoy Snorkelling, Swimming and play with same age children, traveling with other parents.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">In my personal opinion, I would love to <strong>go Maldives with Kid</strong> as you can do almost everything if you have selected a right resort. But if you want to explore Maldives and have a budget constraint then better to stay nearby Airport to avoid heavy transfer bill.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here is the list of Kids Friendly resorts nearby Male Airport</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"102998\" data-permalink=\"https://www.bollywoodnewsworld.com/entertainment/child-friendly-resorts-in-maldives/102968/attachment/kids-club-kuda-hurra-maldives\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.bollywoodnewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kids-club-kuda-hurra-maldives-.jpg?fit=713%2C342&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"713,342\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"kids club kuda hurra maldives\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.bollywoodnewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kids-club-kuda-hurra-maldives-.jpg?fit=300%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.bollywoodnewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kids-club-kuda-hurra-maldives-.jpg?fit=702%2C337&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-102998 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.bollywoodnewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kids-club-kuda-hurra-maldives-.jpg?resize=702%2C337\" alt=\"kids club kuda hurra maldives\" width=\"702\" height=\"337\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.bollywoodnewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kids-club-kuda-hurra-maldives-.jpg?w=713&amp;ssl=1 713w, https://i0.wp.com/www.bollywoodnewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kids-club-kuda-hurra-maldives-.jpg?resize=300%2C144&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.bollywoodnewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kids-club-kuda-hurra-maldives-.jpg?resize=702%2C336&amp;ssl=1 702w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Name of Resort</strong>: <strong>Four Season Resort Maldives at Kuda Huraa</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Distance in Minutes by Speed Boat</strong>: 17.7 Km Speed Boat / Shuttle ride from the male international airport which takes 15-20 minutes to reach the resort.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Kids Club</strong>: Kuda Mas Club</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Additional Charges for Kids</strong>: Child aged 5 and under can stay and eat for free with their parents.

Moreover, you can book a hotel which has a doctor facility available nearby island. \u00a0Always ask your hotel directly otherwise it will be a bigger concern in the case of emergency.</li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">If luxury is not a concern and you want to spend a Budget holiday then you must look out for resort nearby Male International Airport.</span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I advise you to book a holiday in the resort which offers quick pickup and drop, so that young kid should feel comfortable and also help you to avoid extra traveling fatigue due to long Speed boat travel. (Avoid any resort which offers speedboat transfer and located 60 KM from the Male International Airport.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>Because 60 KM will take almost an hour and it is not at all comfortable if you are with young kid below 2 years.</span></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Moreover, if the resort is arranging the pickup and drop from seaplane then better for your kids. But make sure Sea plane will cost you heavy from $400 to $600 for a single person.</span></li>\n<li>Few Resorts in the Maldives offers the special discount for Kids and few group hotels allow kids to &#8220;Eat and Stay Free&#8221;. I would advise you to thoroughly investigate with resort booking team and ensure Kids stay free and Eat Free with adult. Otherwise, they will charge for Kid and it will impact badly on your holiday budget.</li>\n<li>Transfer charges in Maldives are very high, therefore select the resort either nearby Airport or offer free transfer to a kid.</li>\n<li>Most of the resorts in Maldives will not allow you to stay in water bungalow/Lagoon villa if you are traveling with a kid. It may be a disappointing thing for you, but it is true.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.bollywoodnewsworld.com/entertainment/the-5-best-luxury-resorts-in-maldives-especially-for-honeymoon-couples/102703\">Few Resorts in Maldives</a> do not allow Kids because of their &#8220;Adult Only&#8221; Scheme.

Canyoneering is very popular in Cebu and anyone in love with watersports must actually try this out for themselves. Canyoneering is actually a sport in which one has to move over a list of obstacles, by jumping, crawling, swimming riding and much more. This is a game which requires great stamina and also a quick mind, which would help one to take the correct decision at the correct time. One has to keep in mind the slippery rocks as well as the rough terrain and has to equip themselves accordingly. Thus, although this game is exciting and popular, at the same time, this game is also risky.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whitewater rafting (Davao)</h3>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"102960\" data-permalink=\"https://www.bollywoodnewsworld.com/entertainment/water-sports-activities-in-philippines/102956/attachment/white-water-rafting\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.bollywoodnewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/white-water-rafting.jpg?fit=1500%2C996&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,996\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;11&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D300S&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1435926502&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;122&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;800&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0008&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"white water rafting\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.bollywoodnewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/white-water-rafting.jpg?fit=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.bollywoodnewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/white-water-rafting.jpg?fit=702%2C466&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-102960 size-large\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.bollywoodnewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/white-water-rafting-1024x680.jpg?resize=702%2C466\" alt=\"whitewater rafting Philippines\" width=\"702\" height=\"466\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.bollywoodnewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/white-water-rafting.jpg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.bollywoodnewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/white-water-rafting.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.bollywoodnewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/white-water-rafting.jpg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.bollywoodnewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/white-water-rafting.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/www.bollywoodnewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/white-water-rafting.jpg?w=1404&amp;ssl=1 1404w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">White water rafting, another of those sports, where the adrenaline rush is visibly high.
