Woodhouse takes two OC Transpo buses to get from Vanier to his regular 10 a.m. workout at the Soloway Jewish Community Centre (JCC) in the west end.</p>\n<p>The lower part of Woodhouse&#8217;s rear-wheel-drive, multi-thousand-dollar Xplore 2 power chair was coated in mud and salt, which gym manager Ryan Armitage quickly cleaned off before Woodhouse entered the gym. Woodhouse drove his chair back and forth on a patch of cloth to clean the wheels.</p>\n<p>\u201cI&#8217;ve seen a big change in John (since getting the chair),&#8221; Armitage says. &#8220;He&#8217;s just, happier. It&#8217;s been amazing.\u201d</p>\n<p>A chair provided by the ministry of health before Christmas was appreciated but not functional for someone like Woodhouse, who ventures outside in all manner of weather.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe first chair was a mid-wheel drive and those are good for apartments, because you can literally turn on a dime,&#8221; Woodhouse says. &#8220;They are very manoeuvrable. But in winter conditions they don&#8217;t stand up to the task.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Crystal Bastien, a Vanier neighbour of Woodhouse, first posted a Facebook blog and video in September about Woodhouse&#8217;s deteriorating wheelchair, which was rusting and smelly. That led to a story in this newspaper about Woodhouse&#8217;s dilemma, which Armitage included in a letter to Ontario&#8217;s minister of health and long-term care, Eric Hoskins. Woodhouse&#8217;s chair was finally approved.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I am so happy for him,&#8221; Bastien said of John&#8217;s new ride in a text message. &#8220;He deserves it and more.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1159541\" style=\"max-width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wpmedia.ottawacitizen.com/2018/02/woodhouse-475-jpg.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1159541\" data-permalink=\"http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/scanlan-woodhouse-wheels-about-town-doing-community-service-in-his-new-chair/attachment/woodhouse-475-jpg-jpg/#main\" data-orig-file=\"http://wpmedia.ottawacitizen.com/2018/02/woodhouse-475-jpg.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1000,750\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5.6&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Postmedia&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 5D Mark III&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;John Woodhouse is a disabled person who needed a new wheelchair to get around town.

While his supporters help out Woodhouse, in turn he gives back to the community in spades. Since his cause was made public, he has received myriad offers of help, including cash, and declined it all, directing it to Stride instead.</p>\n<p>Woodhouse volunteers for the Healthy Transportation Coalition and for eight years has been doing &#8220;walk audits&#8221; for the Council on Aging of Ottawa, ensuring that elderly and disabled can safely get from Point A to B. He&#8217;s the chairperson for Walk Ottawa. The chair, in the chair.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou actually have to see it to believe it,\u201d Woodhouse says of his transport audits.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeople say, &#8216;Oh, you&#8217;re exaggerating.&#8217; But sometimes it feels like you&#8217;re doing moguls when you&#8217;re riding down the sidewalk.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Woodhouse, who used to work in a publishing warehouse, was hit hard with dystonia, a neurological disease that causes involuntary muscle contractions and tremors that impact movement and speech. He self-medicated with alcohol, which caused his health to deteriorate. Nine years ago, he was admitted to hospital with severe infections in both legs, which had to be amputated just below the hips.</p>\n<p>Woodhouse pulled himself together, quit drinking and started working out at the JCC with Armitage. He left his long-term care facility to live on his own, able to cook and care for himself thanks to his improved strength and self-esteem.</p>\n<p>His own family, which includes two older brothers and a younger sister, has come back into his life after seeing the personal strides he has taken.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had to open up to them and say, &#8216;I don&#8217;t just sit around anymore and watch TV and drink beer,&#8217; \u201d Woodhouse says.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1159540\" style=\"max-width: 545px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wpmedia.ottawacitizen.com/2018/02/woodhouse-474-jpg-e1518913091695.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1159540\" data-permalink=\"http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/scanlan-woodhouse-wheels-about-town-doing-community-service-in-his-new-chair/attachment/woodhouse-474-jpg-jpg/#main\" data-orig-file=\"http://wpmedia.ottawacitizen.com/2018/02/woodhouse-474-jpg-e1518913091695.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"535,750\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5.6&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Postmedia&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 5D Mark III&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;John Woodhouse is a disabled person who needed a new wheelchair to get around town.
