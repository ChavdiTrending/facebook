Also, another restaurant worker has tested positive for the highly contagious virus, exposing an unknown number of people who ate at a Red Lobster in the past month.</p>\n<p>The death toll in Michigan stands at 25 as of the state health department\u2019s most recent update, which included information up to Feb. 14. The state reported 751 confirmed cases as of that date, with more than 80 percent having required hospitalization.</p>\n<p>Most people infected in the multi-state outbreak, which is described as having begun in California although Michigan has been tracking cases just as long, have been homeless or substance abusers. However, depending on the state, one-fifth to one-third of victims have been neither homeless nor substance abusers.</p>\n<p>The outbreak, which includes cases in California, Michigan, Kentucky, Utah, Nevada, New York, Arkansas and Oregon, has sickened more than 1,600 people and killed at least 46.</p>\n<p>Hepatitis A can be spread through food and beverages that are contaminated during production or by infected people during food preparation or serving. Consequently, infected restaurant employees or other foodservice workers can expose other employees or customers \u2014 often without knowing it because people are contagious before symptoms develop.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential exposures at Red Lobster<br />\n</strong>The most recently reported restaurant worker in Michigan who tested positive for hepatitis A potentially exposed people who ate, drank or worked at the Red Lobster restaurant at 27760 Novi Road in Novi, MI, from Jan. 15 through Feb. 14.</p>\n<p>It is past the window of opportunity for many unvaccinated people who were at the restaurant during the possible exposure period. The post-exposure hepatitis A treatment must be giving within two weeks of exposure or it is not effective.</p>\n<p><img class=\"hello\" style=\"display: block; clear: both; text-align: center; margin: 20px auto; padding: 0;\"class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-137402\" src=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2017/02/illustration-syringes-vaccination.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"405\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2017/02/illustration-syringes-vaccination.jpg 405w, http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2017/02/illustration-syringes-vaccination-300x185.jpg 300w, http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2017/02/illustration-syringes-vaccination-60x37.jpg 60w, http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2017/02/illustration-syringes-vaccination-118x73.jpg 118w, http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2017/02/illustration-syringes-vaccination-256x158.jpg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px\" />Anyone who ate or drank anything from the implicated Red Lobster in Oakland County and has developed symptoms of hepatitis A infection should immediately seek medical attention, county health officials said in a public advisory.</p>\n<p>\u201cVaccination can prevent the disease if given within 14 days after potential exposure,\u201d said Kathy Forzley, director of health and human services for Oakland County. \u201cIf you have eaten at this location during these dates and have not been vaccinated for hepatitis A or have a sudden onset of any symptoms, contact your doctor.\u201d</p>\n<p>The county had a special vaccination clinic session yesterday and has another one scheduled for 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday at<b> </b>1010 E. West Maple Road in Walled Lake in the Easterseals office.<b>\u00a0</b></p>\n<p>Most children in the United States have been receiving hepatitis A vaccinations since the preventive became a routine recommendation in 2006. Even though it has been available since 1996, the vast majority of adults have not been vaccinated.</p>\n<p>Hepatitis A is an infection of the liver caused by a virus. The virus is shed in feces and is most commonly spread from person to person by unclean hands contaminated with microscopic amounts feces. Symptoms of infection may include sudden abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, headache, dark urine, and/or vomiting often followed by yellowing of the skin and eyes.</p>\n<p>Symptoms may appear from 14 to 50 days after exposure, but usually develop about one month after exposure to the virus, according to public health officials. Some people who are infected do not become sick, but they are contagious.</p>\n<p><b><i>(To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, </i></b><a href=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/subscribe/#.VtSWqcdln_R\"><b><i>click here</i></b></a><b><i>.)</i></b></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/foodsafetynews/mRcs/~4/9__G7QvFG40\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2018/02/michigan-posts-25th-hepatitis-a-death-restaurant-worker-sick/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t\t<feedburner:origLink>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2018/02/michigan-posts-25th-hepatitis-a-death-restaurant-worker-sick/</feedburner:origLink></item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>Pilgrim\u2019s Pride recalls 50 tons of chicken patties for rubber bits</title>\r\n\t\t<link>http://feeds.lexblog.com/~r/foodsafetynews/mRcs/~3/LE2qWUSQjr4/</link>\r\n\t\t<comments>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2018/02/pilgrims-pride-recalls-50-tons-of-chicken-patties-for-rubber-bits/#respond</comments>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 05:01:44 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[News Desk]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Food Recalls]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Sections]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[chicken patties]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[extraneous material]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[food recall]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FSIS]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[ready-to-eat chicken]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[rubber pieces]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[school cafeterias]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[USDA]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[USDA commodity program]]></category>\r\n\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.foodsafetynews.com/?p=148124</guid>\r\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corp. is recalling more than 50 tons of ready-to-eat chicken patties from schools and other institutions nationwide after a consumer complained of finding rubber in the product.

The packaging identifies the product as \u201cGOLD KIST FARMS<i>, </i>Fully Cooked<i> </i>Whole Grain Home-Style Breaded Chicken Patties,\u201d according to the recall notice posted Friday night by the USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service.</p>\n<p>School cafeteria managers and other foodservice operators should look for the case code of 72491050xx and the product code of 665400 to further identify the recalled chicken patties. The recalled patties have the establishment number \u201cP-20728\u201d inside the USDA mark of inspection on their labels.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe problem was discovered after the firm received a customer complaint on Feb. 13,\u201d according to the recall notice.</p>\n<p>\u201cPilgrim\u2019s Pride distributed the product to institutions, including schools. Although the product was sold through the USDA commodity program, the introduction of the foreign material was due to an equipment failure at the facility.\u201d</p>\n<p>There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.\u00a0Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.</p>\n<p>Customers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.</p>\n<p>Consumers with questions about the recall can contact James Brown, consumer relations manager at Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corp., at 800-321-1470.</p>\n<p><b><i>(To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, </i></b><a href=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/subscribe/#.VtSWqcdln_R\"><b><i>click here</i></b></a><b><i>.)</i></b></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/foodsafetynews/mRcs/~4/LE2qWUSQjr4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2018/02/pilgrims-pride-recalls-50-tons-of-chicken-patties-for-rubber-bits/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t\t<feedburner:origLink>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2018/02/pilgrims-pride-recalls-50-tons-of-chicken-patties-for-rubber-bits/</feedburner:origLink></item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>CDC says more frozen coconut Salmonella illnesses possible</title>\r\n\t\t<link>http://feeds.lexblog.com/~r/foodsafetynews/mRcs/~3/PdkDNGLi6b0/</link>\r\n\t\t<comments>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2018/02/cdc-says-more-frozen-coconut-salmonella-illnesses-possible/#respond</comments>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 05:00:16 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[News Desk]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Foodborne Illness Investigations]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Foodborne Illness Outbreaks]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Government Agencies]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[World]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canada]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[CDC]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[frozen coconut]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Salmonella]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Salmonella outbreak]]></category>\r\n\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.foodsafetynews.com/?p=148117</guid>\r\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Although the agency has posted a final investigation report on a Salmonella outbreak traced to frozen coconut, officials at the CDC are concerned that additional people could be hit by food poisoning because of the product. \u201cThis frozen shredded coconut has a long shelf life and may still be in people\u2019s freezers.

The products were distributed to retailers across the USA.</p>\n<p>A comparison of the FDA list to a list of 27 products provided to <strong>Food Safety News</strong> Thursday by a Smucker spokesperson reveals significant differences.</p>\n<p>While all 18 products on the FDA list were included in the Smucker information, several Gravy Train, Skippy and Kibbles \u2019N Bits products named by the company were absent from the FDA list.</p>\n<p>\u201cOut of a desire to inform consumers quickly, earlier this week we published a list of products that included the ingredient that could have contained extremely low levels of pentobarbital, regardless of whether the products were manufactured during the withdrawal timeframe. The FDA chose to focus on products made within a specific timeframe,\u201d\u00a0a Smucker spokesperson told <strong>Food Safety News.</strong></p>\n<p>FDA is aware of these differences and has requested clarification from Smucker regarding the status of the additional products, according to a statement added to the agency\u2019s consumer alert notice several hours after its initial release.</p>\n<p>Although Smucker has not initiated a consumer-level product recall, as of Friday, Target, Walmart, PetSmart and the Department of Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) have alerted their customers to the product withdrawals.</p>\n<p><b>FDA advice to retailers, consumers<br />\n</b>Retailers should remove the withdrawn pet food from their shelves and/or websites and contact the manufacturer for further instructions. If retailers have records to identify consumers who have purchased the withdrawn product, the FDA encourages those retailers to contact the consumers to alert about the product withdrawal.</p>\n<p>Consumers should not feed their pets the withdrawn lots of canned dog food. Consumers who purchased these products should safely dispose of the cans and/or contact the Sucker company for information about returning the products.</p>\n<p>Consumers who think their pets may be ill from eating food contaminated with pentobarbital should contact their veterinarians immediately.</p>\n<p>The FDA encourages consumers to report complaints about this and other pet food products electronically through the <a href=\"http://www.safetyreporting.hhs.gov/\">Safety Reporting Portal</a> or by calling their state\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/Safety/ReportaProblem/ConsumerComplaintCoordinators/default.htm\">FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinators</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_148092\" style=\"max-width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"hello\" style=\"display: block;

That length of time often is enough for people to get vaccinated and head off the illness.</p>\n<p>Once people get hepatitis A, there is not any specific treatment.</p>\n<p>Symptoms are flu-like, including tiredness, stomach discomfort, fever, decreased appetite, and diarrhea; light-colored stools; more specific symptoms include dark yellow urine and jaundice.</p>\n<p>The Clay County Health Unit at 1009 S. Garfield, Piggott, AR, has immune globulin and hepatitis A vaccines available with an appointment. The contact number is 870-598-3390.

According to Smucker, the amounts of pentobarbital found in their product \u201c\u2026do not pose a threat to pet safety.\u201d</p>\n<p>An FDA spokesperson told <strong>Food Safety News</strong> Wednesday that the agency\u2019s \u201c\u2026preliminary evaluation of the testing results of Gravy Train samples indicates that the low level of pentobarbital present in the withdrawn products is unlikely to pose a health risk to pets.</p>\n<p>&#8220;However, pentobarbital should never be present in pet food and products containing any amount of pentobarbital are considered to be adulterated,\u201d said the FDA spokesperson.</p>\n<p>All of the products included on Smucker\u2019s retailer recall list came from the same manufacturing facility. The company has narrowed its investigation to \u201c\u2026a single supplier and a single, minor ingredient\u2026\u201d used at that facility.</p>\n<p>Jaclyn Bowen, the executive director of Clean Label Project expressed a lack of surprise at the pentobarbital findings.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt Clean Label Project, we believe that sometimes what&#8217;s not on the label is what&#8217;s most important,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cClean Label Project&#8217;s 2017 Pet Food Study revealed high levels of heavy metals, BPA, and acrylamide in some of the nation&#8217;s best selling pet food. The presence of pentobarbital in Gravy Train does not come as a surprise and the Evanger&#8217;s recall was not a one-off, rather the tip of the iceberg of an industry that needs to significantly improve its food safety and quality through testing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Smucker encourages pet owners with questions or concerns about this situation to contact the company by telephone 800-828-9980 or via email at: <a href=\"http://www.bigheartpet.com/Contact/ContactUs.aspx\">http://www.bigheartpet.com/Contact/ContactUs.aspx</a>.</p>\n<p><b><i>(To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, </i></b><a href=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/subscribe/#.VtSWqcdln_R\"><b><i>click here</i></b></a><b><i>.)</i></b></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/foodsafetynews/mRcs/~4/d0VxxHwibCA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2018/02/gravy-train-ol-roy-other-brands-recalled-for-euthanasia-drug/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t\t<feedburner:origLink>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2018/02/gravy-train-ol-roy-other-brands-recalled-for-euthanasia-drug/</feedburner:origLink></item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>Feds post chicken salad alert; Salmonella investigation expands</title>\r\n\t\t<link>http://feeds.lexblog.com/~r/foodsafetynews/mRcs/~3/J-7cQ1gNt2U/</link>\r\n\t\t<comments>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2018/02/feds-post-chicken-salad-alert-salmonella-investigation-expands/#respond</comments>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 06:04:39 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[News Desk]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Foodborne Illness Investigations]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Foodborne Illness Outbreaks]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Government Agencies]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Sections]]></category>\r\n\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.foodsafetynews.com/?p=148065</guid>\r\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[A day after Iowa officials warned the public about an outbreak of Salmonella linked to chicken salad, federal officials issued an alert saying the implicated product was sold in at least four other states.

Opponents are united in the single goal of killing the bill in the committee. The committee has not yet scheduled any action on the bill.</p>\n<p>The two subcommittee members who supported the raw milk bill were Rep. Greg T. Heartsill, R-Chariton, and Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton. Rep. Heartsill is the bill&#8217;s sponsor. Rep. Art Staed, D-Cedar Rapids, voted to kill the measure in the subcommittee.</p>\n<p>HF 2055&#8217;s future is now in the hands of the 21-member House Local Government Committee. It, like the Iowa House of Representatives, is under GOP control. Heartsill might request the bill be re-assigned to the House Agriculture Committee.</p>\n<p>The Iowa bill would permit dairies to sell raw milk directly to consumers. The unpasteurized milk would have to bear a warning label stating:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px\">&#8220;This container holds raw milk not subject to state inspection or other public health regulations that require pasteurization and grading.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The bill provide for fines ranging from $65 to $650 and up to 30 days in jail for violations of the proposed law. Misdemeanor charges would apply.</p>\n<p>Opponents form a powerful coalition of both industry and public health interests concerned about the dangers of raw milk, including such pathogens as E. coli, Salmonella, and Campylobacter.

However, because marijuana products are not legal under federal law, those regulations are not applied.</p>\n<p>Another hazard\u00a0involves\u00a0the issue of product\u00a0contamination from\u00a0the employees during the various stages of the production process.\u00a0The stakes for cross-contamination are the highest when employees are handling the product, making proper employee training and personnel hygiene policies should be is place at all marijuana growing and production facilities, Burton contends.</p>\n<p>Unless cannabis products such as\u00a0edibles can\u00a0be treated the same as other food products and have\u00a0a comprehensive food safety program including\u00a0plans, procedures, training, monitoring and verification,\u00a0hazards can be expected, according to Burton.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/foodsafetynews/mRcs/~4/KGHP4tn4vTE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2018/02/food-safety-concerns-at-cannabis-production-facilities-continue/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t\t<feedburner:origLink>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2018/02/food-safety-concerns-at-cannabis-production-facilities-continue/</feedburner:origLink></item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>Pork and chicken empanadas recalled for undeclared allergen</title>\r\n\t\t<link>http://feeds.lexblog.com/~r/foodsafetynews/mRcs/~3/_67oolziCGU/</link>\r\n\t\t<comments>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2018/02/pork-and-chicken-empanadas-recalled-for-undeclared-allergen/#respond</comments>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2018 22:55:40 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[News Desk]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Food Recalls]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[allergens]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[chicken]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[empanadas]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FSIS Recall]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Inc.]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[misbranding]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[pork]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Saker ShopRites]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[undeclared egg]]></category>\r\n\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.foodsafetynews.com/?p=148045</guid>\r\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Linden, NJ-based Saker ShopRites Inc. is recalling 19,757 pounds of pork and chicken empanadas because of misbranding and an undeclared allergen, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).

Food safety gets a small slice of that.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe funding of food safety programs needs a boost given then FDA\u2019s multi-year responsibility for implementing the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) and the continuing challenges in this area, \u201c said Thomas Gremillion, director of the Food Policy Institute at the Consumer Federation of America who is an Alliance, board member.</p>\n<p>\u201cFSMA represents a fundamental change in philosophy and programming, and the agency needs more resources to implement the law effectively.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2018/02/fy2019fedbudget_406x250.png\"><img class=\"hello\" style=\"display: block; clear: both; text-align: center; margin: 20px auto; padding: 0;\"class=\"size-full wp-image-148011 alignleft\" src=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2018/02/fy2019fedbudget_406x250.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"406\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2018/02/fy2019fedbudget_406x250.png 406w, http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2018/02/fy2019fedbudget_406x250-300x185.png 300w, http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2018/02/fy2019fedbudget_406x250-60x37.png 60w, http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2018/02/fy2019fedbudget_406x250-118x73.png 118w, http://www.foodsafetynews.com/files/2018/02/fy2019fedbudget_406x250-256x158.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px\" /></a>The Trump budget proposal includes $1.4 billion for food safety across all FDA programs, which is $10 million above Congress&#8217;s Continuing Resolution for the fiscal year 2018. The total includes $1.4 billion in budget authority and continues $16 million in currently authorized user fees.</p>\n<p>The budget document says FDA&#8217;s food safety portfolio during FY 2019 will include implementing mandatory standards for imported foods, rapidly detecting and responding to major foodborne illness outbreaks, and helping consumers make healthy choices with the most up-to-date science.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Having issued all seven foundational rules to establish a risk-based food safety system, FDA&#8217;s implementation of the Food Safty Modernization Act continues by ensuring stakeholders across the public, and private sectors are positioned to comply with these rules,&#8221; the document says. It promises Congress that FDA will &#8220;build on these regulations and guide the modernization of our food safety system&#8221; in 2019.</p>\n<p>FDA regulates more than $2.4 trillion in the medical products, food, and tobacco products that are consumed annually in the U.S., including about 75 percent of the food supply.</p>\n<p>Trump budget writers also propose returning the siluriformes, aka catfish, inspection program to FDA. USDA&#8217;s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) currently inspects catfish under an agreement with FDA that supposedly ended a decade-long controversy about which agency should have the responsibility.</p>\n<p>FSIS&#8217;s $1.257 billion annual budget will roll over into the new year. It will lose the Codex Alimentarius Office in a transfer to USDA&#8217;s Trade and Foreign Affairs mission area. Codex is a 180-nation body for setting world food standards.</p>\n<p>FSIS estimates it will collect $240 million in user fees during FY 2019 for charges covering overtime, holiday and voluntary inspection services. The budget proposes future user fees for all domestic inspections, import re-inspections and central operational costs for state, federal and international meat, poultry, and egg inspections.</p>\n<p>The additional FSIS user fees would not take effect until 2020. Dependence on user fees in food safety budgets is on the increase by both FDA and FSIS.</p>\n<p>FDA&#8217;s year-old animal drug and generic animal drug user fee, for example, is currently up for renewal. Senate Health Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander, R-TN, says authority to continue the user fee is &#8220;critical to keeping the food supply safe.&#8221; Those charges support the 115-person animal drug and generic animal drug review unit.</p>\n<p>The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, located in Atlanta, will see a $44 million reduction in its discretionary programs. CDC&#8217;s $5.5 billion discretionary budget is only half the story. It&#8217;s total budget with additional allocations to combat opioids totals more than $11 billion.</p>\n<p>CDC is taking a cut of $703 million in total discretionary dollars. The reduction is due in part to shifting the Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Disease lab safety activities to the Public Health Scientific Services and other CDC activities to the National Institutes of Health.</p>\n<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH)) would get an FY 2019 budget of $34.8 billion in the Trump budget, which is $699 million more than the last Continuing Resolution out of Congress. NIH owns 281 facilities with more than 15 million gross square feet of space used for hospitals, laboratories and offices.</p>\n<p><b><i>(To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, </i></b><a href=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/subscribe/#.VtSWqcdln_R\"><b><i>click here</i></b></a><b><i>.)</i></b></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/foodsafetynews/mRcs/~4/vrYrB0Q3K6o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2018/02/it-gives-only-a-little-but-trump-budget-takes-nothing-way-from-food-safety-programs/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t\t<feedburner:origLink>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2018/02/it-gives-only-a-little-but-trump-budget-takes-nothing-way-from-food-safety-programs/</feedburner:origLink></item>\r\n\t</channel>\r\n</rss>\r\n",
