In recent years, London has hosted an <a href=\"https://www.ccma.org/cgi/page.cgi/_article.html/News/Country_Music_Week_2016_Delivers_8.4_Million_in_Economic_Impact_\">incredibly successful Country Music Week and CCMA Awards</a>; completed its <a href=\"https://musiccanada.com/news/london-ontario-completes-first-ever-music-census/\">first ever music census;</a>\u00a0 <a href=\"https://musiccanada.com/news/london-city-council-to-consider-two-motions-aimed-at-making-the-forest-city-more-music-friendly/\">taken steps to modernize noise bylaws</a> for music and dancing on outdoor patios; and hosted <a href=\"https://www.londonmusicoffice.com/news/advocacy/londons-first-music-career-day\">its first Music Career Day</a>. In recognition of these efforts, Music Canada presented London\u2019s Music Industry Development Officer, Cory Crossman, and Chris Campbell, Director of Culture and Entertainment Tourism at Tourism London, with our <a href=\"https://musiccanada.com/news/playback-2017-music-canada-presidents-award-presented-to-cory-crossman-and-chris-campbell/\">2017 President\u2019s Award</a> for their incredible commitment to making London a Music City.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are thrilled to host the 2019 JUNO Week celebrations here in London. As one of Canada\u2019s emerging cultural scenes we are excited to show the world how culturally rich and diverse London is,\u201d said Chris Campbell. \u201cThe JUNO Awards is London\u2019s opportunity to bring artists and music fans to our great city to showcase our hospitality and our growing music scene and we could not be happier to be the 2019 Host City.\u201d</p>\n<p>JUNO Week 2019 is expected to drive approximately $10 million in economic impact in London, a figure which is consistent with results in previous host cities. The <a href=\"http://junoawards.ca/london-host-2019-juno-awards/\">CARAS release</a> states that since the JUNOS began touring across Canada in 2002, the awards have driven more than $120 million in economic impact.</p>\n<p>\u201cOntario is a key music hub in Canada and North America,\u201d said Daiene Vernile, Ontario\u2019s Minister of Tourism, Culture and Sport. \u201cOur vibrant culture is driven by our exceptional talent and diversity, making Ontario a great fit for hosting the JUNO Awards in 2019. We have a thriving music industry that makes a significant contribution to Ontario\u2019s economy by creating jobs, generating sales and building the province\u2019s profile at an international level.

The article was followed by <a href=\"http://www.socan.ca/news/research-most-young-canadians-want-live-music-cities\">another release</a> expanding on the results of the survey and proposing ways that municipalities and music fans can support live music.</p>\n<p>Results from SOCAN\u2019s research include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>\u201cNearly two-thirds (63%) of urban Canadians agree that it is important to live in a neighbourhood with a vibrant arts scene that includes live music.\u201d</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>Respondents with a university degree (71%) were more likely to agree with this sentiment versus those with a college (58%) or high school (49%) education. Urban residents in Atlantic Canada (74%) were also most in agreement versus residents in other parts of Canada, followed by Quebec (68%), British Columbia (67%), Ontario (63%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (54%) and Alberta (50%).</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>\u201cThe vast majority (80%) of urban Canadians would support a portion of funds going to community arts &amp; culture developments.\u201d</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>SOCAN\u2019s survey stated that \u201ccurrently new property developers in some municipalities are required to put a portion of funds towards community development, city parks, etc,\u201d and asked respondents whether they would support a portion of these funds being put towards arts &amp; culture developments like live music venues and local theatres.</p>\n<p>Urban Canadians who agreed that living in a neighbourhood with a vibrant arts and live music scene was important to them were significantly more likely to agree (91%) that development fees should support arts &amp; culture developments than those who did not agree (62%).</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>\u201cRoughly half (49%) of urban Canadians would enjoy owning and living in a condo that offered live music in the lobby.\u201d</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>SOCAN\u2019s survey noted that many condos in the US and Europe have restaurants and bars in their lobbies. Of the urban Canadians who responded that they would enjoy live music in their lobby, young Canadians aged 18-34 were most likely to agree (66%) and respondents living in Quebec were less likely to agree (39%) than Canadian outside of Quebec (55%).</p></blockquote>\n<p>As noted in <em>The Mastering of a Music City</em>, music can play a powerful role in city brand building, and also in attracting and retaining talent and investment in a city\u2019s broader economy. In a world where talent is highly mobile, some cities are focusing on the vibrancy of their music and arts scene as a way to stand out from the competition. SOCAN\u2019s research adds further evidence to support this observation.</p>\n<p>Access to the spaces and places in which music can be made &#8211; from education to rehearsal to recording to performance &#8211; is also one of the seven key strategies to grow and strengthen a local music economy identified in <em>The Mastering of a Music City</em>.</p>\n<p>But the relationship between residential buildings and these spaces, including live music venues, rehearsal spaces, and arts hubs, is one in which cities across the world are attempting to strike the right balance. New residential developments have, in some cases, been developed on properties formerly occupied by live venues or community arts hubs. Other venues have been threatened by rising rents, property values and taxes that do not consider the social value of these cultural spaces.</p>\n<p>What tools are at a city\u2019s disposal that might be, given SOCAN\u2019s research, supported by urban Canadians?</p>\n<p>401 Richmond, a live-work community arts hub in Toronto, was recently confronted with a property tax increase that threatened its closure. Recognizing the cultural significance of venues such as 401 Richmond, the Province of Ontario announced it was prepared to, in conjunction with the City, develop a new tax class for heritage properties.</p>\n<p>Toronto City Councillor Joe Cressy then brought a successful motion to council to formally begin the process of establishing \u201c<a href=\"http://www.joecressy.com/401_richmond_here_to_stay\">Toronto&#8217;s new Culture and Creative property tax sub-class</a>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another tool adopted by cities like Melbourne, San Francisco, Montreal and London is the Agent of Change principle in land use planning. <em>The Mastering of a Music City </em>describes the principle as such:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe Agent of Change Principle determines which party is required to adopt noise mitigation measures in situations of mixed land use. If the \u2018agent of change\u2019 is a new apartment building that is being built near a pre-existing music venue, the apartment building is responsible for sound attenuation. On the other hand, if the music venue is undergoing renovations and therefore is the \u2018agent of change\u2019 in the neighbourhood, it is responsible for noise mitigation.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>In Toronto, while various measures are under consideration and review, the City\u2019s Film &amp; Entertainment Industries&#8217; Music Unit can now add comments to applications circulated by the Planning Division for any new development within 120 metres of an existing live music venue so that staff can identify any potential conflicts and make recommendations.</p>\n<p>These and other policies, like reviewing noise bylaws, can go a long way in allowing live music venues and residential properties to coexist, facilitating the conditions for the vibrant arts and cultural communities that SOCAN\u2019s research has shown are important to nearly two-thirds of urban Canadians.</p>\n<p>This research comes as regions across Canada, including London, Vancouver, Hamilton, Windsor-Essex, Moncton, Ottawa, Barrie-Simcoe County, and more have implemented or are considering strategies to better support and grow their music ecosystems. SOCAN\u2019s new findings provide even more evidence for the value in municipal strategies that create the environment for music ecosystems to flourish.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://musiccanada.com/news/new-research-from-socan-provides-more-evidence-for-the-value-of-music-cities-strategies/\">New research from SOCAN provides more evidence for the value of Music Cities strategies</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://musiccanada.com\">Music Canada</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Leading Canadian copyright lawyer says \u201csupport for Canada\u2019s content creators is imperative\u201d in Globe and Mail op-ed</title>\n\t\t<link>https://musiccanada.com/news/leading-canadian-copyright-lawyer-says-support-for-canadas-content-creators-is-imperative-in-globe-and-mail-op-ed/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2018 21:08:52 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Corey Poole]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Advocacy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Industry News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Barry Sookman]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Copyright]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[I Value Canadian Stories]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[The Value Gap: Its Origins Impacts and a Made-In-Canada Approach]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Value Gap]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://musiccanada.com/?p=55773</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Barry Sookman, one of Canada\u2019s leading copyright lawyers, wrote an op-ed published in The Globe and Mail on January 18, addressing two of the major challenges facing the cultural industries in Canada: pirate streaming and the Value Gap.

He says that most of Canada\u2019s leading cultural industries are also affected, including journalism, television and film.</p>\n<p>A coalition of author and publisher groups have documented the harm caused by the Value Gap to their sector, and in 2017 launched the <a href=\"http://www.ivaluecanadianstories.ca/\">I Value Canadian Stories</a> campaign to urge Canadian lawmakers to \u201crestore balance between the need to compensate our creators for educational copying and the need to promote access to quality content.\u201d The campaign website notes that royalties to creators and publishers for copying of their works have declined by 80% since 2013.</p>\n<p>Sookman concludes that, given the magnitude of this problem and the threat to Canada\u2019s cultural industries, the issue, as well as practical solutions, \u201cdeserve the attention and support of Canadians.\u201d</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://musiccanada.com/news/leading-canadian-copyright-lawyer-says-support-for-canadas-content-creators-is-imperative-in-globe-and-mail-op-ed/\">Leading Canadian copyright lawyer says \u201csupport for Canada\u2019s content creators is imperative\u201d in Globe and Mail op-ed</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://musiccanada.com\">Music Canada</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>A series of recommendations from Toronto Music Advisory Council are one step closer to policy after Economic Development Committee approval</title>\n\t\t<link>https://musiccanada.com/news/a-series-of-recommendations-from-toronto-music-advisory-council-are-one-step-closer-to-policy-after-economic-development-committee-approval/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2018 20:30:37 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Corey Poole]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Industry News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Music Cities]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Josh colle]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Michael Thompson]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Spencer Sutherland]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Toronto Music Advisory Council]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://musiccanada.com/?p=55757</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Members of Toronto\u2019s Economic Development Committee passed a suite of Toronto Music Advisory Council (TMAC) recommendations today aimed at providing better support for the city\u2019s live music venues, and facilitating the collection of data for an international study on night time economies.

A sense of urgency to address the situation for venues came to a fever pitch in 2017.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs you might recall at the same time last year our city was facing an unprecedented crisis of music venues closing at an alarming rate of one per week,\u201d said Sutherland. \u201cThankfully, so far this year we have seen none of that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Later in the meeting Josh Colle, Councillor for Ward 15 (Eglinton-Lawrence) and TMAC Co-Chair, said the story that is not often told is about venues opening or re-opening, such as Hugh\u2019s Room and The Hideout. Colle praised the work of TMAC, and specifically the venue sustainability working group, which he said \u201creally lit a fire\u201d under councillors to act to provide better protection and support for live music.</p>\n<p>The agenda item up for consideration was titled \u201c<a href=\"http://app.toronto.ca/tmmis/viewAgendaItemHistory.do?item=2018.ED26.9\">Night-time Economy &#8211; Collection of Data and Protection of Live Music Venues</a>,\u201d and recommendations made to the Committee by the TMAC were divided into two categories.</p>\n<p>The first related to an international <a href=\"http://www.rhiweb.org/\">study of the night time economy being conducted by the Responsible Hospitality Institute</a> examining effective and sustainable models for night time economy management.\u00a0 TMAC requested that the General Manager, Economic Development and Culture, in collaboration with the Director, Office of Emergency Management and the Executive Director, Municipal Licensing and Standards, facilitate the collection of accurate data by the Toronto Association of Business Improvement Areas (TABIA) to contribute to the international study.</p>\n<p>Cities around the globe are examining various policies to best support their night time economies, and some cities, such as Amsterdam and New York, have appointed a Night Mayor to represent the businesses and cultures that thrive outside of the nine-to-five. In a 2016 Huffington Post blog, Music Canada\u2019s Executive Vice President Amy Terrill asked \u201c<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/music-canada/toronto-night-mayor_b_10282934.html\">Does Toronto need a Night Mayor</a>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Councillor Thompson noted that Toronto is paying attention to initiatives in other cities, including New York and London, and felt the City could do more to maximize the potential of its night time economy. \u201cThere are many things that are taking place and in a city like ours &#8211; it never sleeps,\u201d Thompson told the Committee. \u201cPeople sleep at individual times but the city itself is always alive and vibrant.\u201d</p>\n<p>The second recommendation from TMAC was all about live music and was made up of a suite of nine recommendations included in a previously requested report on protecting live music venues in Toronto. The General Manager, Economic Development and Culture, was asked to consider the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create tax benefits for local live music venues.</li>\n<li>Initiate and expand music pilot programs including ideas for artist tour bus parking, musician load in/out zones and artist poster zones.</li>\n<li>Create a music venue certification program.</li>\n<li>Amend zoning and licensing to protect existing venues and encourage new ones including a clarification of what business license music venues require.</li>\n<li>Create a panel, consisting of a member of the Film and Entertainment Office, members of the Live Working Group, and senior members of planning, building and licensing, with regard to providing advice to individuals and/or organizations wishing to establish new and/or grow existing live music venues.</li>\n<li>Review Municipal Licensing Regulations governing parks, green spaces, and city owned outdoor venues.</li>\n<li>Support Night-time Economy initiatives with The Toronto Association of Business Improvement Areas (TABIA) and Responsible Hospitality Institute (RHI).</li>\n<li>Financial support for an economic impact study of local live music venues.</li>\n<li>Financial support for a local Music Passport event series.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All recommendations in the agenda item passed with the support of the Economic Development Committee and will now be brought to Toronto City Council at a yet to be determined date.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope that these suggestions are embraced and supported by Committee and then by Council,\u201d commented Councillor Colle. \u201cI hope we see the continuation of what I think is \u2013 well, what the challenge is &#8211; the healthiest and most robust Music City in the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://musiccanada.com/news/a-series-of-recommendations-from-toronto-music-advisory-council-are-one-step-closer-to-policy-after-economic-development-committee-approval/\">A series of recommendations from Toronto Music Advisory Council are one step closer to policy after Economic Development Committee approval</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://musiccanada.com\">Music Canada</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Barenaked Ladies &#038; Steven Page announced as 2018 Canadian Music Hall Of Fame Inductees</title>\n\t\t<link>https://musiccanada.com/news/barenaked-ladies-steven-page-announced-as-2018-canadian-music-hall-of-fame-inductees/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2018 16:17:50 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Bram Gonshor]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Industry News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[2018 JUNO Awards]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Music Hall Of Fame]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Juno Awards]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[National Music Centre]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://musiccanada.com/?p=55746</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts &#38; Sciences and CBC have announced world-renowned rock band Barenaked Ladies as the 2018 inductees into the Canadian Music Hall Of Fame.

Eight of the bands albums have been certified Canadian Gold, along with two of their DVD releases.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are honoured to be inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame,\u201d said Ed Robertson. \u201cFor almost 30 years we\u2019ve worked hard to write the best songs we can, make the best records we can make, and do the best shows possible. We\u2019ve traveled the world with our music, but Canada has always been home. This is very special for us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have so many great memories of my years with Barenaked Ladies, from our beginning in our parents\u2019 basements to playing our songs for audiences all over the world,\u201d said Steven Page. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly proud of all we achieved together, the greatest of all being the fact that our music continues to be a part of so many Canadians\u2019 lives.
