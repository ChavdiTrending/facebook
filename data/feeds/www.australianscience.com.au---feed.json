Bike frame, boats, tennis rackets and even MiG fighter jets can benefit from this, as well as foil, screen doors, window frames, pots and pans, nails, computer parts, sinks, and more. What\u2019s more, Australia has the most mineable scandium in the world, which will dramatically reduce its currently ludicrous price once it is actually mined.</p>\n<h2>What Is Scandium?</h2>\n<p>If you don\u2019t know it already, than that last paragraph may have been a bit confusing for you, but there\u2019s nothing to be worried about as we\u2019ll talk about scandium a lot and explain everything.</p>\n<p>Scandium is an element that <a href=\"https://www.famousscientists.org/dmitri-mendeleev/\">Dmitri Mendeleev</a> first thought to exist in the 1860s. It wasn\u2019t discovered until 1878 by a Swedish chemistry professor named <a href=\"https://www.worldofchemicals.com/281/chemistry-articles/lars-fredrik-nilson-discoverer-of-scandium-element.html\">Lars Fredrik Nilson</a>. He discovered it while observing euxenite and gadolinite. It turns out, in nature, it can be found in a lot of other minerals, including but not limited to aluminum phosphate minerals, muscovite, pyroxene, bazzite and ixolite.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/21/scandium\">Scandium, at atomic number 21</a>, is a silvery metallic element in the transition metal category. It has also been classified as a rare earth element due to its characteristics. It isn\u2019t particularly rare, but it is rare to find in high concentrations. Processing of this element is also complex, meaning that there are very few sources of this mineral. As a result, it wasn\u2019t until 1937 when scandium would be isolated in its pure form (2). It took another twenty three years before a full pound of pure scandium would be produced. Due to a lack of a reliable supply, scandium hasn\u2019t been used very much, but a dependable source of scandium, like the one available in Australia, could change that and increase the global demand.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_15533\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-15533\" src=\"http://www.australianscience.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/sc-800x400.jpg\" alt=\"sc\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of <a href=\"http://pse-mendelejew.de/en/scandium/\">PSE Mendelejew</a></p></div>\n<h2>Emerging Applications</h2>\n<p>Considering the fact that scandium is an expensive metal due to its scarcity, its possibility to be used in various industries has actually made him available and highly wanted metal.</p>\n<p>If it were offered at more reasonable price, as a direct result of demand, it could be used in many different applications, including transportation and the booming energy industry. Scandium use typically falls into three categories: <strong>strengthening of alloys, use of electrical properties and heat resistance</strong> as it relates to Solid Oxide Fuel Cells, and to capture optical properties for improvements in natural lighting in lamps, lasers and crystals, and video screens (3).</p>\n<h3>Strengthening of Alloys</h3>\n<p>Scandium is the strongest refining agent that is known as it related to aluminium. Making the alloy just 0.5 %, scandium can double or even triple the strength of many aluminium alloys without sacrificing its malleability. It can also improve the plasticity, thermal conductivity, corrosion resistance, durability and strength. Scandium is effective at retaining the weldability of aluminium while reducing overall weight. A reduction in weight improves aerodynamics and fuel efficiency.</p>\n<h3>Electrical Properties and Heat Resistance</h3>\n<p>The adoption of fuel cells has been stagnant except in NASA missions, until now. <a href=\"http://mypages.iit.edu/~smart/garrear/fuelcells.htm\">Solid Oxide Fuel Cells</a> (SOFCs) are used to create electricity, water, heat, and carbon monoxide from natural gas and oxygen. The hard ceramic material that SOFCs are made of converts the natural gas to energy at high temperatures. The lower operating and reaction temperature of scandium extends the life of the fuel cell.</p>\n<h3>Capturing Unique Optical Properties</h3>\n<p>Sunlight is created by the combustion of scandium on the sun. In the same way it produces natural light via a lighting element. It is used in film and even stadium lighting to recreate daylight. High intensity lamps made using scandium also can provide light resembling sunlight.</p>\n<h2>Supply and Demand</h2>\n<p>Currently, scandium trading across the globe is reported at merely 10 tons per year. It is typically mined as a by product of rare earth elements in China, Russia, Kazakhstan, and the Ukraine. Ukraine offers the only direct deposit of scandium in the world. There is currently no typical market for scandium; it is not on any exchanges and there are no futures markets involving it. Typically it is traded commercially between private parties which means that there is no solid data about its trade.</p>\n<h2>The Risks of Scandium</h2>\n<p>Although scandium seems to be a real global blessing, it is not without its downfalls. Due to the bull market it is not easy to invest in. Because it is not traded on an exchange, the pricing is hard to follow. This also disallows any hedge ability. There is only a small market for scandium currently, and the supply of it relies on it being a by product of other minerals. This means that the supply of scandium is subject to intermittent increases and decreases with production stoppages. The pricing of scandium is determined by its discovery and not by any measure of <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp\">gross domestic product</a> (GDP). Scandium chloride, scandium iodide, scandium acetate and scandium fluoride are all priced differently. Scandium in its purest form is expensive and scarce, which means that widespread adoption is a huge feat. We also lack much in the way of knowledge about technology that needs to be used to produce scandium. The currently known stockpiles of scandium are rapidly depleting, and the commercialisation of scandium SOFCs is hard to educate people on.</p>\n<h2>Implications for Australia</h2>\n<p>Basically, a big of the risk of scandium is a result of it being a newer discovery, and not being widely available for mining. A mine in New South Wales is aiming to produce 78,000 tons of scandium ore per year (4), which would be of major economic assistance for Australia. Having one of the largest mines for scandium, such a rare element, could make a country very wealthy due to the rarity and price of the element. However, oversupply is a risk, as it is with any product. If supply of scandium increases too rapidly in a short period of time, there could be a price crash. The best way to handle this seems to be to use long term agreements for the mining of scandium. The mining companies must be able to show that they can produce a scalable, high quality supply of scandium before they are able to reach these long term agreements, which could be a challenge. If undertaken properly, however, there is no reason to say that Australia doesn\u2019t stand to gain from this incredible element.</p>\n<p>Resource used in this research paper:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sitecraft.net.au/news/unknown-metal-is-great-news-for-australian-manufacturing/\">Unknown Metal is a great news for Australian Manufacturing</a>, published piece at Sitecraft</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://books.google.com.au/books/about/CRC_Handbook_of_Chemistry_and_Physics_93.html?id=-BzP7Rkl7WkC\">CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 93rd Edition</a>, edited by William M.

The 1920\u2019s made beautiful, bronzed skin the latest fad, a trend that has persisted to this day in many parts of the world. Achieving that perfect sun-kissed look, however, has not always been safe.<span id=\"more-15523\"></span></p>\n<p>Since doctors and health officials became aware of the dangers of UV rays on our skin, people have searched for a better alternative. Tanning beds and sun lamps have been linked to cancer, giving way to the <a href=\"https://brazilianbutterfly.com/posts/the-evolution-of-spray-tanning\">evolution of spray tanning</a>. Spray tanning formulas have even been enriched to contain organic oils and nourishing vitamins, in an attempt to make the option more appealing to customers.</p>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/content/5/e15104\">new research</a> from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania points to a new way to change the color of our skin. Researchers made an exciting discovery during a cancer study when they observed that sex hormones were affecting pigment production in regular cells. This breakthrough has uncovered a new doorway to controlling the lightening and tanning of the skin.</p>\n<p><strong>What Causes Skin to Change Color?</strong></p>\n<p>Scientists have long known the effects the sun has on skin. The sun darkens skin by causing damage to the DNA, which the body then repairs by increasing the production of melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH). This short protein binds and activates another protein (MC1R) on melanocytes. Ultimately, these proteins trigger the production of pigment in skin cells.</p>\n<p>An association was also previously made between sex hormones and pigment changes. The alterations in skin pigmentation in pregnant women suggested that sex hormones played a role. In fact, this transformation has been documented for more than 2,000 years, so it is not a new observation.</p>\n<p>While this connection was previously known to exist, the exact mechanism and hormones were not yet known. Since many hormones and other molecules experience changes in levels during pregnancy, isolating which single or combination is responsible for the changes in skin pigmentation would prove a significant challenge.</p>\n<p>The fact that taking birth control pills would sometimes cause women to develop a darker skin pigment on their face did provide further insight, as these only contain derivatives of the hormones estrogen and progesterone.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovering a New Door</strong></p>\n<p>During the study, <a href=\"http://www.med.upenn.edu/ridkylab/\">Dr. Ridky</a> and colleagues noticed that when adding estrogen levels typically seen during pregnancy to human melanocytes, they would respond by increasing the production of melanin. The content of melanin within the cells increased by 200%-300% after four days. They also discovered that the cells would produce less pigment when adding progesterone.</p>\n<p>What the <a href=\"http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/news/News_Releases/2016/04/ridky/\">study revealed</a>, was that estrogen was making pigment by accessing pathways that were already known to exist, it was just accessing them in a different manner. This new door, or receptor, was able to create the same outcomes. The issue then became trying to figure out what type of receptors these were, since melanocytes do not have the classic estrogen receptor, nor do they act on MC1R.</p>\n<p>The scientists were able to identify the melanocytes express receptors accountable for the skin pigment effects following further testing. This occasion would be the first time that these receptors were studied. These were found to be two non-classical receptors; the GPER, a separate estrogen receptor, and PAQR7, a progesterone receptor.</p>\n<p>The team was able to identify the receptors by developing synthetic progesterone and estrogen derivatives. These were designed only to fit those newly discovered receptors. The researchers selected synthetic hormones, as natural hormones could unintentionally attach to different receptors and set of unknown processes.</p>\n<p>Researchers took further steps towards the development of a treatment drug, by incorporating the hormone derivatives into a gel. This formula was applied to mice&#8217;s ears and was found to increase melanin levels by roughly 60% within a three-week period.</p>\n<p>The gel well also used on pigmented guinea pigs, of which one animal can display different skin colors. The animal had its haunches shaved on either side, with one part receiving the application of gel with the estrogen derivative, and the other a gel without derivatives or hormones. The side with the hormone derivatives was noticeably darker after a couple of weeks when compared to the other.</p>\n<p><strong>How These Results Could Lead to Treatments</strong></p>\n<p>The knowledge obtained during this study could help lead to a new form of therapeutics, which is of particular importance given the currently limited types of safe and effective treatment options available for those with pigmentation disorder. New therapies could offer help with melasma, post-inflammatory hyper and hypopigmentation, and maybe even vitiligo. Currently, correcting these disorders is difficult, without exposure to toxic bleaching agents or UV radiation.</p>\n<p>The new information gathered during the study suggests that derivatives of these selective sex hormones can be used to affect the natural melanin production machinery. This discovery would allow for the opportunity to develop a drug that safely targets the natural pigment production pathway within a person&#8217;s skin cells.</p>\n<p>Of course, an actual cream is still a long way from completion. The team would still need to create a formula that could be used by humans and ensure there were no side effects to using the cream. The compounds will also need to go through clinical trials and the FDA before they are made available to dermatologists. The development process itself is expensive, so a start-up has already been formed to attempt to woo potential investors.</p>\n<p>The news would not only be significant for the medical industry but is also set to have a substantial impact on the cosmetics industry, where people already spend billions of dollars globally to change the color of their skin. Many of these attempts are unsuccessful, and even potentially dangerous, so developing a safe and effective alternative in the form of a drug could radicalise the industry.</p>\n<p>As more and more people become aware of the cancer risks involved in UV tanning, whether you\u2019re out in the sun or on the beds, they are turning to other options. Spray tanning is a far healthier option, with salons already offering several color levels lasting about a week at a time. However, the industry is constantly evolving, so this new potential option would offer customers an exciting alternative.</p>\n<b><div style=\"border:1px solid #000000; padding:5px;\">Cite this article:</b><br>Ivanovic  J (2016-09-12 08:45:21).

CRISPR, an acronym for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, is a natural defense mechanism found in bacteria. In the 1980s, scientists began observing patterns of bacterial genomes and now understand more about how the process of preventing viruses from replicating works.</p>\n<p>A viral microbe copies the genetic material in each spacer into an RNA molecule. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cas9\">Cas9 enzymes</a> cradle the RNA molecule, and in combination, they explore a cell. If they find genetic material that matches the CRISPR RNA, the viral RNA attaches to it. The Cas9 enzymes cut the DNA in half, preventing it from multiplying. Scientists believe that CRISPR has the potential to revolutionize biology because it can identify and remove bad genes from a DNA strand at very little economic cost.</p>\n<p><strong>Health Algorithms</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_156836.html\">According to a recent study, a new computer-based test</a> can help predict the likelihood of developing dementia. The test utilizes a complex algorithm based on information such as a person&#8217;s age, weight, gender, social habits and previous medical history. Those whose test results showed them to be at higher risk could then take additional preventive measures by increasing activities that have been proven to improve memory. The focus of this technology is prevention.</p>\n<p>Researchers used the test to assess the medical records of over 226,000 people over the age of 60. The algorithm proved to be so accurate that the developers decided to share it freely with other researchers. Their goal is that it become available to the public and an important element of a national healthcare database. They predict that it may take a few years to reach those goals.</p>\n<p><strong>Integrated Health Care Software</strong></p>\n<p>Another technological advance in medicine are <a href=\"http://praktika.com.au/praktika-online-dental-practice-management-software-brief.html\">software services that enable those in the medical profession to deliver a higher level of care</a>. From a patient&#8217;s perspective, that higher level of care is manifested at every level of the health care system. Doctors are able to develop superior treatment plans by quickly and securely sharing medical information with specialists. All the time saved by not having to make physical appointments and drive to them can be used to increase communication between doctors and their patients. Automated scheduling capabilities also give other medical staff more time to communicate with the patient, which results in providing the doctor with more useful information.</p>\n<p>One of the most common complaints of health care professionals in the last decade is the growing amount of paperwork they are required to complete. Health care professionals choose their careers based on a desire to spend their time having human interactions that result in people feeling better, not learning complex insurance billing procedures. Clinical trials have shown that <a href=\"http://medical-practice-management-software-review.toptenreviews.com/the-benefits-of-switching-from-paper-to-medical-practice-management-software.html\">one of the benefits for health care providers</a> is the simplification and automation of some of the most time and energy consuming billing processes.</p>\n<p><strong>The Future</strong></p>\n<p>Scientists and health care professionals predict that the next thing that will revolutionize health care is the concept of precision medicine. Rather than offering every patient the same treatment for the same illness or condition, this concept focuses on developing individual treatment plans based on a number of genetic and environmental factors. Research in the field of epigenetics has demonstrated that genes are not, as was once believed, fixed, but are in fact affected by the environment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/precision-medicine-initiative-cohort-program\">The Precision Medicine Initiative</a>, which is currently being developed and is expected to be launched later this year, promises to change the way medical professionals are trained by incorporating many of the newest scientific discoveries. This will allow doctors to more easily develop and implement valuable new techniques into their practices. Scientific advancements in genetics, computer technology, and medicine are making the future of health care look very bright indeed.</p>\n<b><div style=\"border:1px solid #000000; padding:5px;\">Cite this article:</b><br>Ivanovic  J (2016-03-04 08:08:16).

Economics is only one aspect of the controversy. According to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/20/college-costs-new-research-weighs-value-of-college-education_n_1813337.html\">one\u00a0statistics</a>, as many as one in five undergraduate degrees don&#8217;t produce earnings any greater than a high school diploma. However, a college degree does prove helpful in gaining employment. The unemployment rate of four-year graduates is only 4.5 percent, as compared to the 24 percent among those with only a high school diploma.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bestvalueschools.com/understanding-the-rising-costs-of-higher-education/\">According to one article</a> the cost of a traditional four-year college degree has risen by more than 538 percent since 1985. While many degrees produce a relatively low increase in wage-earning power, overall, a college graduate earns an average of $1.3 million dollars more over a lifetime than those without degrees. However, 40 percent of new graduates are saddled with an average of $22,000 dollars in school loan debt and the interest on that debt often translates into much more.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.expresspros.com/subsites/AmericaEmployed/documents/Career-Tech-vs-College-White-Paper.pdf\">technical education usually costs about half the price of a four-year degree</a>, and in many cases, results in more earning power. Technical education schools also tend to partner with businesses and focus on providing skills that are in high demand in the professional world. <a href=\"https://www.acteonline.org/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=1915\">Another benefit of an alternative education focused on technology</a> is that, like classical education, it teaches the necessary skills for people to work on a team.</p>\n<p><strong>Social Considerations</strong></p>\n<p>The history of classical education and the inclusion of such subjects as philosophy and political science can be traced back to ancient Rome. All free citizens were expected to study grammar, logic and rhetoric in order to participate in civic affairs including public debates and military service. In democratic countries, a literate and informed citizenry is the basis for public education. While economic rewards are an important consideration in choosing an educational path, money, as they say, isn&#8217;t everything.</p>\n<p>While technical education is more focused on productive skills, supporters of classical education point to a number of worthwhile educational objectives that are equally important. A classical education focuses on improving oral and written communication skills, framing issues in historical context, exposure to art and literature and civic responsibility. To achieve those goals, in addition to their major course of study, students are required to take courses in the sciences and humanities. Most people would agree that that increased knowledge of the natural world, ourselves, and our humanity provides both individual and social benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Timing is Everything</strong></p>\n<p>There was a time when a person chose a single career within their lifetime, and even worked at the same company for their entire career. However, there are many studies nowadays that show how people today can expect to have an average of seven careers in their lifetimes. Largely due to technological innovation and advancement, choice in education has become not just a one-time life decision, but a series of choices over time.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://edutechdebate.org/ict-in-schools/there-are-no-technology-shortcuts-to-good-education/\">controversy surrounding classical versus technological education</a>, the good news is that there is no need to choose one at the expense of the other. Because technical education costs less and provides more earning power more quickly, many young people may opt for it as only their first rather than their only choice. They may choose to complete their classical educations while working, without the need to accumulate debt.</p>\n<p>Further, many employers offer tuition credits to employees taking courses that can potentially benefit their businesses. In fact, technology is developing so rapidly that many employers rely on their <a href=\"http://www.itic.com.au/i-t-career-experience-program/\">employees taking courses periodically from educational programs</a> focused on rapidly changing technology and providing the skills and knowledge required to utilize it.</p>\n<p>All education is valuable, as evidenced by the many four-year colleges that now offer practical professional internships in addition to a liberal arts education. More than ever, today&#8217;s workforce is composed of lifelong learners. They must have the skills to effectively problem-solve in an increasingly complex world in which technology has expanded the definition of community to include other cultures and societies as well as their own. That&#8217;s why when it comes to education, it&#8217;s no longer a matter of which type, but of when.</p>\n<b><div style=\"border:1px solid #000000; padding:5px;\">Cite this article:</b><br>Ivanovic  J (2016-03-04 07:46:17).

These include using medicines, such as antibiotics, to target the pathogens and parasites, or reducing the risk of spread by using preventative measures.</p>\n<p>However, a recent collaboration between University of Colorado Cancer Center and University of Virginia led to a discovery that demonstrated the effectiveness of a third alternative. This exciting new research looks at manipulating characteristics of the human body to eliminate the mechanism that permits pathogens to cause the disease.</p>\n<p>The findings not only demonstrate how a cancer-science approach can be applied to the field of infectious disease, but it will also have major implications for a disease that causes many thousands of deaths all over the world.</p>\n<h2>What is Entamoeba Histolytica?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.newleafdetoxresort.com/blogs/detox-blog/33908996-what-is-a-parasite\">Parasites are organisms</a> that live in or on another organism, known as the host, in order to survive. They gain benefits by deriving nutrients from, or at the expense of the host. While some parasites don\u2019t affect the host organism, others multiply, grow or give off toxins, which can result in a parasitic infection and some very unpleasant symptoms.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15500\" src=\"http://www.australianscience.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/parasites-2.jpg\" alt=\"parasites\" width=\"841\" height=\"460\" /></p>\n<p>There are several ways in which you can contract a parasite, however poor hygienic practices, contaminated food and water, unclean fruits or vegetables and undercooked meat are the most common methods of transmission.</p>\n<p>Entamoeba histolytica, or E. histolytica, is a one-celled parasite that kills human cells and causes a disease known as intestinal amebiasis. Amebiasis is a parasitic infection of the intestines, which infects approximately <a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis\">50 million people</a> worldwide, while causing over 100,000 annual deaths.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15501\" src=\"http://www.australianscience.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/parasites-1.jpg\" alt=\"parasites\" width=\"841\" height=\"460\" /></p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/amebiasis/general-info.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, only about 10% to 20% from those who are infected with E. histolytica become sick from it. Symptoms tend to be mild and include stomach pain, loose stool and abdominal cramping.</p>\n<p>A severe form of amebiasis, known as amebic dysentery, is associated with fever, severe stomach cramping and frequent bloody and watery stools. It occurs if the parasite invades the lining of the intestine and is a much more dangerous form of the disease. If the parasite were to enter your blood stream, it can end up in the lungs, brain, heart, liver, or other organs, and cause abscesses and tissue destruction.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15502\" src=\"http://www.australianscience.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/parasites-23.jpg\" alt=\"parasites\" width=\"841\" height=\"595\" /></p>\n<h2>Transmission of E. Histolytica</h2>\n<p>Entamoeba histolytica is spread by faecal-oral route. While amebiasis can affect anyone, it is more common in those who live in, or have travelled to, tropical countries with underdeveloped sanitary conditions. Areas with high rates of amebic infection include parts of Central and South America, Africa, Mexico and India.</p>\n<p>Others at greater risk for amebiasis include people with compromised immune systems and other health conditions, those who live in institutions with poor sanitary conditions and men who have sex with other men.</p>\n<h2>Current Solutions</h2>\n<p>Currently, there are two widely used strategies when it comes to protecting humans from infectious disease. These include using medicines such as antibiotics to target the pathogens and parasites, or addressing the environmental factors that permit transmission of the disease.</p>\n<p>In the case of E. histolytica, antibiotic is available for treatment. Uncomplicated cases of amebiasis are generally treated with a 1-day course of antibiotics.</p>\n<p>However, if the parasite is present in the intestinal tissues, then damage to infected organs must also be addresses. In these cases, surgery may be necessary. Amebiasis can be deadly if left untreated.</p>\n<p>Preventative measures to avoid amebiasis focus on proper sanitation. The CDC offers advice on measures to take when traveling to a country with poor sanitary conditions. This includes drinking bottled, boiled or treated water, thoroughly washing fruits and vegetables before eating and avoiding food sold by street vendors, unpasteurized dairy products and ice cubes or water fountains.</p>\n<h2>Exploring a Third Strategy</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/articles/srep13613?WT.ec_id=SREP-631-20150915&amp;spMailingID=49549665&amp;spUserID=ODkwMTM2NjQzMAS2&amp;spJobID=762070432&amp;spReportId=NzYyMDcwNDMyS0\">New research</a> has demonstrated the effectiveness of a third strategy against infectious diseases. This involves manipulating the host\u2019s genes in order to remove the mechanism that allows pathogens to cause disease.</p>\n<p>The collaboration for this research stemmed from a conversation between <a href=\"http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/departments/Pathology/academicprograms/cancerbiology/Pages/theodorescu_canbio.aspx\">Dan Theodorescu, MD, PhD</a>, director of the University of Colorado Cancer Center and <a href=\"https://med.virginia.edu/faculty/faculty-listing/wap3g/\">William A. Petri, Jr., MD, PhD</a>, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases &amp; International Health at the University of Virginia.</p>\n<p>The idea was to apply a groundbreaking technique used in cancer research to the study of infectious disease. Together with <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chelsea_Marie\">Chelsea Marie, PhD</a>, postdoctoral researcher in the Petri Laboratory at Virginia, they sought to determine if the elimination of any one cell could provide immunity to Entamoeba histolytica, through the silencing of genes found in human cells.</p>\n<p>This was done by using a technique called RNAi, which allowed them to create a library of bladder cancer cells with thousands of independent, silenced genes. These cultures were then challenged with the E. histolytica parasite.</p>\n<p>When this technique is used in cancer research, they look for genes that make cells more susceptible to chemotherapy when silenced. For this research, the infectious pathogen was the analogue of chemotherapy.</p>\n<p>While the parasite managed to decimate many thousands of those independent cell structures, a small number appeared to resist it. In order to find out if these silenced genes offered immunity to these cells or merely survived by chance, Marie retested those cells that had survived.</p>\n<p>This process was repeated over nine generations of cells, and over these generations of selection, the cultures became more and more enriched for cells that lacked certain genes. The genes that presented resistance were then identified using next generation sequencing.</p>\n<p>This revealed that many of those genes were involved in potassium transport, managing the flow of potassium into and out of human cells. A follow-up experiment then revealed that new intestinal cells treated with E. histolytica demonstrated potassium efflux just prior to cell death. That meant that those cells that were unable to transport potassium didn\u2019t die.</p>\n<p>The researchers then reversed the direction of their experiments in order to confirm that this was indeed what was causing the resistance to the parasite. They took new cells and blocked their ability to transport potassium, through the use of drugs. By blocking potassium efflux, they were able to manufacture cells that were resistant to the parasite.</p>\n<p>The targeting of human genes that enable E. histolytica to cause disease is a major discovery. It demonstrates that cancer-science approach can be applied to the field of infectious disease in order to explore genetic mechanisms of resistance.</p>\n<b><div style=\"border:1px solid #000000; padding:5px;\">Cite this article:</b><br>Ivanovic  J (2015-12-28 06:28:03).

And perhaps no item is more evocative of the film\u2019s fascinating world as the Jedi lightsaber. It\u2019s no surprise that many of us wonder: how far are we from holding one of our own?</p>\n<p>According to this <a href=\"https://www.costumecollection.com.au/blog/2015-lightsabers/\">animated infographic</a>, we\u2019re already 75% there \u2013 but that last 25% still seems elusive indeed. Let\u2019s explore just how close we are to protecting our galaxy with this \u2018elegant weapon for a more civilised age\u2019.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15492\" src=\"http://www.australianscience.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Lightsaber_Final.gif\" alt=\"Lightsaber\" width=\"400\" height=\"935\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Is a Lightsaber Exactly?</strong><br />\nYes, most of us can probably bring the lightsaber-wielding Jedi to the mind\u2019s eye without too much difficulty. But if we\u2019re going to delve deeper into reproducing them in the real world, we need to understand exactly what the films suggest they\u2019re made of and what they can do.</p>\n<p>Firstly, it\u2019s easy to see that they\u2019re incredibly powerful. They easily slice through solid chunks of metal, cut through flesh, yet the hilt\u2019s temperature is controlled so as not to harm the user. The laser itself can also be \u2018turned off\u2019 at the press of a button, allowing the Jedi to put away their weapon in a holster.</p>\n<p>Overall, it\u2019s an incredibly flexible weapon that combined with a Jedi\u2019s power is a force (no pun intended!) to be reckoned with. Science, however, is proving to be a worthy adversary that\u2019s stopping Lucas myth from becoming reality.</p>\n<p><strong>Stopping the Beam</strong><br />\nThe lightsaber seems to use lasers of some sort \u2013 however, those in our world are invisible until their end point and also don\u2019t have a fixed length. We\u2019re nowhere near developing the technology to stop the laser beam in its tracks. Light needs to hit something solid to stop, or it needs to be refracted through the use of a mirror.</p>\n<p>The conclusion? It doesn\u2019t seem possible that we could ever use lasers in their current form to build something similar. The beam of laser light would simply continue exponentially and would not be shown until reaching its natural end \u2013 just think of a classic laser pointer as an example.</p>\n<p><strong>Finding a Power Source</strong><br />\nWhile we currently have plenty of options to power up an item that emits light or plasma of such magnitude, there\u2019s one \u2018minor\u2019 problem. Contrary to what the lightsaber suggests (such as a small battery pack), reality calls for something a little more expansive.</p>\n<p>What we\u2019re left with is a weapon that can only last for just a few seconds or a bulky and heavy item that would not be possible to use as anything like a sword. The familiar noise of the lightsaber would also come from the power source, as plasma or light do not naturally emit such a sound.</p>\n<p><strong>Light Has No Mass</strong><br />\nAnother issue that we have is that light has no mass. The lightsaber is more powerful than any sword or axe, yet light has no properties that would allow such behaviour.</p>\n<p>Consider the fact that light does not even have the capability to repel other light, yet in Return of the Jedi we clearly see Luke defeating his enemies by repelling blaster shots. Unfortunately, our own laws of physics would now allow this. You can imagine how feeble a lightsaber duel would look with the two weapons simply bypassing each other!</p>\n<p>The films themselves are also not exactly consistent. In the original trilogies the weight of the weapon suggests something similar to the longsword (hence the slow and pensive fighting style), but the prequels have \u2018upgraded\u2019 the weapons to be lightweight fencing instruments. Regardless of which it actually is, light itself would weigh less than both.</p>\n<p><strong>What About Plasma?</strong><br />\nGE Engineer Matt Gluesenkamp has stated that the closest real-world example of what the lightsaber consists of is <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/50728-secrets-of-the-jedi-lightsaber-infographic.html\">plasma generated electrically</a>. The problem with using plasma in this manner is that the battery power that would be required to create this amount of electricity would render the weapon unusable.</p>\n<p>Another problem is the sheer heat of plasma. The suggested temperature of the lightsaber would hit four figures Fahrenheit, yet all our heroes need is a handy hilt that is seemingly capable to withstand such temperatures.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we currently have no such material that would be able to do something similar. Not only that, plasma emits heat as well, which would mean that anything even a few inches from the lightsaber would be charred beyond recognition!</p>\n<p><strong>New Findings</strong><br />\nWhile Time Magazine <a href=\"http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/10/01/someone-finally-invented-real-working-lightsabers/\">sensationally reported</a> that the fabled Jedi weapon is finally a reality, the headline is unfortunately closer to click-bait than anything else. Nevertheless, the findings by scientists at Harvard and MIT are promising indeed.</p>\n<p>Teams of physicists have worked together to bind photons that can be said to behave in a similar manner to what we\u2019d expect from the Skywalker weapon of choice. As a byproduct of other experiments, scientists have observed that photons fired through rubidium atoms behaved in a unique manner.</p>\n<p>Opposite to massless particles that don\u2019t interact with other molecules, in this case they would form together and move in a uniform manner. This effect is essentially what the lightsaber suggests it\u2019s doing, which perhaps forms a basis for future developments.</p>\n<p>However, what we currently have is still way off a working model. While the particles do indeed interact in an entirely novel way, it\u2019s still a simple interaction. There\u2019s plenty of work to be done before we have our own versions of Luke and Obi-Wan protecting law and order. Considering just how impossible this particular behaviour seemed just a few years ago, Star Wars fans are allowed to remain hopeful.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re not there yet, but technological advancements of recent years make it feel as if the lightsaber is scintillatingly close. Nevertheless, the presented obstacles are perhaps yet still a bridge too far and it may be several generations before we\u2019re capable of reproducing what they managed a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.</p>\n<b><div style=\"border:1px solid #000000; padding:5px;\">Cite this article:</b><br>Ivanovic  J (2015-12-23 06:16:49).

We all know the associated risks of being overexposed to our sun\u2019s rays, yet recent scientific studies have shown that chemicals used in common sunscreen products may also be causing irreparable damage to our planet\u2019s coral reefs.</p>\n<p>The media has also started to take notice of the startling warnings. You may have read the sensationalist headlines, with words such as \u2018killing\u2019 or \u2018destroying\u2019 being used to describe sunscreen\u2019s effect. But in this case, it\u2019s not just clickbait.</p>\n<p>While climate change is still the primary cause for concern, the ingredients found in most sunscreen products have now been scientifically proven to cause damage to our coral reefs. We\u2019ve already lost 80% of coral reefs in the Caribbean. If we want to continue enjoying those beautiful holidays in the <a href=\"https://www.reeffree.com.au/travel-guide/place/great-barrier-reef\">Great Barrier Reef</a>, something needs to happen.</p>\n<p>And no, this isn\u2019t scaremongering or pseudo-science. Two peer reviewed studies have been conducted that put matters beyond reasonable doubt:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sunscreens Cause Coral Bleaching by Promoting Viral Infections. Published in April 2008, you can <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2291018/\">read the full study at PMC</a>.</li>\n<li>Toxicopathological Effects of the Sunscreen UV Filter, Oxybenzone (Benzophenone-3), on Coral Planulae and Cultured Primary Cells and Its Environmental Contamination in Hawaii and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This recent study from October 2015 has had heavy press coverage recently. The study is heavy reading, so you may want to read the <a href=\"http://www.haereticus-lab.org/story_content/ecotox-sunscreen-lotion.pdf\">shorter explanation</a> by one of the authors if you want to get a grip on the material.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, the scientific jargon can be a little confusing and that\u2019s understandable. The following explains the core of the issue in slightly simpler terms.</p>\n<p><strong>The Problem (In Layman\u2019s Terms!)</strong><br />\nThe study published in the Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology (October 2015) deals specifically with oxybenzone (benzophenone-3). The study calls the threat from this chemical \u2018ecological and existential\u2019. The chemical is described as being \u2018highly toxic to juvenile corals\u2019, affecting them in four distinct ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Damaged DNA</strong>: oxybenzone damages the DNA of juvenile corals, causing them to have trouble reproducing. And even if they do reproduce, the offspring is usually not optimally healthy.</li>\n<li><strong>Coral Bleaching</strong>: Sunscreens promote viral infections in coral, causing coral bleaching. This is extremely worrying, associated with natural events such as El Nino. Oxybenzone can cause coral to bleach at lower temperatures, posing an even greater threat to the environment.</li>\n<li><strong>Endocrine Disruptor</strong>: Juvenile coral that has been exposed to oxybenzone can sometimes lead to death due to skeletal encapsulation.</li>\n<li><strong>Deformity</strong>: Oxybenzone causes deformity in coral, which severely impacts health.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The studies also found issues with other chemicals. Butylparaben, a preservative, has also been linked to coral bleaching. Ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate and 4-methylbenzylidene camphor fall under the same category. Considering just how damaging coral bleaching is, it\u2019s undoubtedly a worrying scenario.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most worrying aspect of the study is that very little of these chemicals are required to cause damage. In fact, it\u2019s as little as one drop of water in what would be the equivalent of almost seven Olympic swimming pools. Considering that it\u2019s estimated that up to 14 thousand tonnes of sunscreen washes of our bodies each year, the potential results are frightening.</p>\n<p>And that figure doesn\u2019t even include water and waste discharges. Just think of the sunscreen that we use before going out for a run, enjoying an outdoor barbecue, or catching a few rays while relaxing in our gardens and parks. We all proceed to wash our sunscreen off, potentially landing in our waters and damaging coral reefs.</p>\n<p><strong>What Can We Do About It?</strong></p>\n<p>It\u2019s clear that the effects of human activities on our environment are worrying, but it\u2019s still possible to protect yourself from the sun\u2019s harmful rays without having an impact on the planet. If you\u2019re going to be swimming, snorkeling or scuba diving near coral reefs, ensure you opt for a <strong>coral reef safe sunscreen</strong>.</p>\n<p>Considering that major brands such as L\u2019Oreal and Coppertone both use oxybenzone, it\u2019s clear that consumers are going to have to do a little digging to find a suitable alternatively. Unfortunately it\u2019s not as easy as looking for a simple label, but there are ways of figuring out which products are safe to use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The main ingredient you\u2019re looking to avoid is <strong>oxybenzone</strong>. This is the chemical that has been scientifically proven to harm coral reefs.</li>\n<li>Inspect the product label and also avoid butylparaben, octinoxate, and 4-methylbenzylidene camphor. The latter is banned in the USA and Japan, but both Canadian and European sunscreens may contain it.</li>\n<li>The problem with sunscreen is that it comes off while in the water. Look for a product that has been proven to be effective at being water resistant, meaning it will stay on your skin (and off our coral reefs!).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It\u2019s worth keeping in mind that a government body does not officially regulate coral reef safe sunscreens. Such labels are simply promotional and set by the manufacturers themselves, meaning that it\u2019s up to you to check the ingredients carefully. If you are in doubt, email or tweet the manufacturer to verify whether the product meets the above requirements.</p>\n<p>We can also look to our governments. For example, local authorities in American cities such as Fort Lauderdale and Ocean City have constructed sewer outfalls that divert wastewater from beaches into the ocean. In addition to the problems with sunscreen waste, this toxic mix also contains birth-control pill residue and other harmful products. It\u2019s imperative that we encourage our powers that be to consider the environment and not just convenience or the almighty dollar.</p>\n<p>Remember, coral reefs don\u2019t just add to a picturesque setting, an exotic artwork for us to admire. Coral reefs also play an integral role in biodiversity, protect our coasts from natural disasters, encourage tourism around the world, and also have an impact on marine life (having significant value to fisheries). If we\u2019re to continue enjoying these natural wonders, we need to act quickly and decisively.</p>\n<b><div style=\"border:1px solid #000000; padding:5px;\">Cite this article:</b><br>Ivanovic  J (2015-11-24 09:35:24).

Recent advancements in the industry have allowed dentists to severely cut down on their workload in a way you may not have expected.</p>\n<p>Dentists use dental composites to restore teeth to their original hardness and rigidity, making them essential in dental repairs such as restoration fillings. They are typically made of amalgams such as composites made of silica, plastic compounds or ceramic, or of mixtures of silver, mercury or tin.</p>\n<p>The problem is that these can be prone to breakages and suffer from a short life span. In fact, it is thought that replacement fillings <a href=\"http://munews.missouri.edu/news-releases/2015/1019-innovative-dental-composite-receives-fda-clearance/\"> make up 75% of dentist\u2019s work</a>. The use of nanotechnology in dentistry has allowed engineers to come up with a viable solution to this problem.</p>\n<p><b>Using Nanotechnology</b></p>\n<p>The short lifespan of current dental composites have led engineers to look into the concept of <a href=\"http://mgadental.com.au/developments-in-dental-embracing-state-of-the-art-technology-in-the-world-of-dentistry/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">using nanotechnology in dentistry</span></a>, with fillings that could last longer than the conventional kind. The benefit of using nanomaterial is that when a material becomes smaller, it reduces the chance of it containing a defect, thus increasing the strength of that material.</p>\n<p><b>The Development of NovaPro Flow</b></p>\n<p>Hao Li, a professor at the University of Missouri\u2019s college of engineering has developed a \u201cflowable\u201d composite known as NovaPro Flow,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dentistrytoday.com/news/industrynews/item/477-fda-approves-nanofiber-flowable-composite\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which has recently received FDA clearance</span></a>. This composite incorporates calcium phosphate nanofiber technology in conjunction with nanoparticles. It is injected as a liquid composite in a cavity via syringe, allowing for easy and precise delivery to the patient\u2019s tooth.</p>\n<p>Making the composite flowable was essential as it allows the liquid to easily flow and fill every crack and crevice in the tooth. Once this has been properly fitted, the material is then hardened in less than 20 seconds through a high-intensity blue light. Once hardened, the nanofibers provide support to the overall structure of the tooth, much like rebar in concrete, which helps to ensure greater longevity.</p>\n<p><b>The Benefits of Using Nanofibers</b></p>\n<p>The use of calcium phosphate nanofibers not only helps to improve the tooth\u2019s strength, but also helps to retain its shine. Of course, there is another reason that nanofibers are so important. They are made of a material very similar to that of your tooth mineral and bone marrow, which makes it very biologically accepting.</p>\n<p>It is thought that this new composite is stronger than anything else currently on the market, when compared to other commercial dental filling products. Dentists say that the NovaPro Flow could help both dentists and patients alike, due to its strength and bonding ability. This would allow for longer lasting restorations, meaning that patients would need to come in less for replacement fillings. This would be a great benefit for everyone in the dental field.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hao-li-5b87778\">Li, president of Nanova Biomaterials Inc.</a> is also currently working on obtaining FDA approval of other nanofiber-based biomaterials, including orthopaedic screws and universal dental composites. Nanova Biomaterials already produces StarBright dental varnish, which is used as a cavity varnish and for the treatment of dentin hypersensitivity.</p>\n<p>While these advancements in dental technology are of great benefit to both dentists and patients, it is important to remember that healthy dental care comes down to more than just using the latest technologies. Regular dental visits and maintaining good dental hygiene is essential to help avoid preventable dental treatment.</p>\n<p>Image source:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/cadcamzone/4679188766/\">https://www.flickr.com/photos/cadcamzone/4679188766/</a></p>\n<b><div style=\"border:1px solid #000000; padding:5px;\">Cite this article:</b><br>Ivanovic  J (2015-11-23 12:33:07).

It\u2019s the largest sand island on the planet, boasts gorgeous freshwater lakes, towering rainforests, and the idyllic <a href=\"https://www.fraserfree.com.au/index.php?/travel-guide/place/75-mile-beach\">75 Mile Beach</a>. It\u2019s no surprise that the island attracts some 380,000 tourists per year.</p>\n<p>Fraser Island is also an important cultural site to the local Butchulla people, who believe the spirits of ancestors still roam the beautiful rainforest trees and sand dunes. The lakes hold a particularly special place, with creeks such as Wanggoolba and Eli being important sacred sites.</p>\n<p>But is this natural paradise and cultural shrine at risk? Many experts believe that Fraser Island is increasingly under threat due to climate change. We take a look at how this phenomenon is affecting the island, from changes we\u2019re already seeing in the present day to potential consequences in the coming years.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15473\" src=\"http://www.australianscience.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/graph.png\" alt=\"graph\" width=\"662\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<h2>Sea Level Rise</h2>\n<p>10,000 years ago Fraser Island was part of Australia\u2019s mainland, but rising sea levels indicate that much of the island could disappear completely. It\u2019s likely that the popular Parallel Dune ridges will be submerged, with the land that\u2019s less than 10m above sea level being lost.</p>\n<p>Experts speaking at the Sixth Biennial Fraser Island Conference have estimated that the rising sea levels will have an even <a href=\"http://www.frasercoastchronicle.com.au/news/climate-change-to-affect-fraser/2741560/\">greater impact on the island</a> than on the Great Barrier Reef (though the state government insists <a href=\"http://www.gympietimes.com.au/news/no-data-yet-to-support-island-erosion-risk-ehp/2666430/\">there is no hard data</a>), an area that is widely known to be at great risk. &#8220;It&#8217;s the most &#8216;erodible&#8217; surface, it&#8217;s all sand, it&#8217;s not rock or anything else,&#8221; said John Sinclair, organiser of the event.</p>\n<p>The Great Sandy Strait can be expected to widen, which will lead to potentially dangerous changes to currents and tidal flows. Furthermore, coastal erosion will lead to changes in wind velocity and increased storm occurrences, again dangerous for both locals and tourists alike.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15472\" src=\"http://www.australianscience.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fraser-island.jpg\" alt=\"Fraser island\" width=\"520\" height=\"380\" /></p>\n<h2>Climate Warming and Variation</h2>\n<p>Fraser Island is known as an overlap zone in the region, allowing certain species to thrive in cooler temperatures compared to areas further north. Increasing temperatures, however, will translate to species such as the blackbutt and tallowwood disappearing. Fish species such as the Tailor may also opt to migrate to cooler climes. This will undoubtedly lead to lower biodiversity in the region.</p>\n<p>Climate change on Fraser Island won\u2019t just be limited to an increased average temperature. It will also potentially lead to greater climate variability in the region. This could result in increased occurrences of frost, which even if sporadic will have a potentially catastrophic effect on the region\u2019s flora and fauna.</p>\n<h2>Wind Patterns</h2>\n<p>Climate change has already led to an indisputable increase of northerly winds, which has led to a neutralisation of the region\u2019s south-easterly winds. While this may seem trivial, this trend leads to increased vegetation on the island\u2019s famous sand dunes. Noam Levin, a scientist who has been studying the region, has highlighted a significant <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-07-24/climate-change-fears-for-fraser-dunes/1365322\">decrease in the number of dunes since the 1980s</a>. Furthermore, the increased algae have a negative impact on both fishing and swimming, spoiling the island\u2019s previously pristine waters.</p>\n<p>Perhaps even more worrying is that the combination of increasing temperatures and stronger winds will lead to a higher frequency of fires. Not only that, we can also expect them to be more severe and dangerous both to humans and local wildlife.</p>\n<h2>Lake Deterioration</h2>\n<p>Dr Wade Hadwen (Fraser Island Defenders Organisation) has highlighted that the island\u2019s lakes are <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-07-24/climate-change-fears-for-fraser-dunes/1365322\">slowly deteriorating</a>. The reasons behind this are two-fold. We first have the aforementioned build-up of algae, which has led to a downturn in water quality. However, the issue can also be attributed to man-made pollution from roads situated near the lakes.</p>\n<h2>Tourism Impact</h2>\n<p>Almost four hundred thousand visitors arrive at Fraser Island on a yearly basis. It\u2019s expected that this number will only rise. Environmental degradation has not only come as the result of climate change, but also the sheer number of tourists. For instance, water and soil quality have seen a downturn, while the number of 4WD vehicles has led to increased erosion.</p>\n<h2>What Can We Do?</h2>\n<p>The potential impact of climate change on Fraser Island makes for bleak reading. But despite this, there\u2019s plenty that we can do in order to preserve the natural beauty of this World Heritage site.</p>\n<p><strong>Monitor, Research, Mitigate</strong>: As noted by the state\u2019s comment on the impact on the Great Barrier Reef, some of the data collection is still in its infancy. It\u2019s important that we continue to monitor the progression of certain issues (e.g. erosion of sand dunes) to ascertain the gravity of environmental changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Adaptation and Management</strong>: The number of tourists landing on Fraser Island isn\u2019t necessarily an issue, however, it\u2019s important that they are managed correctly. Considering that the island\u2019s primary revenue stream is no longer sand mining and logging, progress has already been made. Tourism is more sustainable, as long as the correct measures are in place.</p>\n<p>Tourists should be taught to engage with Fraser Island in an environmentally focused way. Instead of planning individual journeys, for example, visitors could work closely with experienced tour agencies to ensure a responsible visit to the island. Additional information should also be provided in situ to ensure both tourists and locals alike are aware of the risks of human impact.</p>\n<p>Small tweaks can also lead to big changes. For example, experts agree that run-off from sand roads is impacting the lakes. Roads should be <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2008/s2453577.htm\">relocated further away</a>. While this adds a touch of inconvenience, it\u2019s a small price to pay.</p>\n<p>Additionally, government agencies should increase investment in sewage management and the installation of environmentally friendly toilet units. This will ensure popular camping areas are kept clean and that degradation of soil quality is kept at a minimum.</p>\n<p><strong>Increased Research &amp; Knowledge Share</strong>: At present there is a distinct lack of \u2018cross-fertilisation\u2019 of knowledge when it comes to the management of World Heritage sites. Best practices can only be created and adhered to if all involved parties are aware of the latest research and recommendations.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, additional academic research is required to ensure the correct action can be taken. The opening of <a href=\"http://www.flinders.edu.au/science_engineering/fms/School_ENVR/RHD-PhD/Discovery PhD position ad v2.pdf\">funded doctorate positions</a> is a step in the right direction. The availability of in-depth research will allow both governments and communities to take the correct action.</p>\n<b><div style=\"border:1px solid #000000; padding:5px;\">Cite this article:</b><br>Ivanovic  J (2015-11-11 06:21:29).

It\u2019s a major cause of embarrassment for thousands of affected Australians, and is usually caused by obesity or other natural effects of aging. A double chin is actually just an extra layer of submental fat that forms around the neck and can sometimes sag, creating the impression of a second chin. Up until now, <a href=\"http://athrefacialplastics.com/cosmetic-procedures/face/chin-augmentation/\" target=\"_blank\">surgery was the only way to remove it</a>.</p>\n<p>However, there is now a surgery-free way to remove the dreaded double chin thanks to <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm444978.htm\">a recently FDA-approved drug called Kybella (or deoxycholic acid)</a>. Approved as a treatment for adults with moderate-to-severe submental fat below the chin, Kybella is an injectable drug that works by helping the body absorb fatty tissue. In essence, the drug dissolves the submental fat under the chin by destroying the fat cell\u2019s membrane, causing it to burst. The remains of the cell are then reabsorbed by the body\u2019s normal metabolic pathways.</p>\n<p>According to the results of numerous clinical trials, injecting Kybella into the affected area can produce a noticeable reduction in submental fat in just 6 months. Patients can receive up to 50 injections in a single treatment (which usually lasts around 5 minutes), and sessions must be spaced at least 1 month apart for best results. No bandages are required, and recovery time is between 2 and 3 days.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15412\" src=\"http://www.australianscience.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/648x415_illustration-avantapres-traitement-kybella-reduire-double-menton-injections.jpg\" alt=\"648x415_illustration-avantapres-traitement-kybella-reduire-double-menton-injections\" width=\"648\" height=\"415\" srcset=\"http://www.australianscience.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/648x415_illustration-avantapres-traitement-kybella-reduire-double-menton-injections.jpg 648w, http://www.australianscience.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/648x415_illustration-avantapres-traitement-kybella-reduire-double-menton-injections-150x96.jpg 150w, http://www.australianscience.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/648x415_illustration-avantapres-traitement-kybella-reduire-double-menton-injections-300x192.jpg 300w, http://www.australianscience.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/648x415_illustration-avantapres-traitement-kybella-reduire-double-menton-injections-490x314.jpg 490w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://ferrignofit.com/2015/05/double-chin-not-anymore/\" target=\"_blank\">Image source</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mykybella.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/KYBELLA-Combined-FINAL-Labeling.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">There are some side-effects</a>, however, that patients need to be made aware of before embarking on this journey. The most common side-effects reported in clinical trials were swelling, bruising, pain, numbness, redness and areas of hardness around the treatment area. However, most of these should disappear within a few days after treatment.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to understand that Kybella can also cause far more serious side-effects, such as possible nerve damage in the jaw. Although these side-effects are much less common, some patients have reported uneven smiles, weak facial muscles, and even trouble swallowing after receiving treatment. Indeed, according to Amy G. Egan of the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, \u201cTreatment with Kybella should only be provided by a licensed health care professional, and patients should fully understand the risks associated with use of the drug before considering treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p>The estimated cost per treatment is expected to be around $500 per session. The exact pricing details are being withheld until the product\u2019s release in June 2015.</p>\n<p>Using Kybella to get rid of that unwanted double chin may not suit everyone. In cases where patients have excess skin, a better alternative may be chin augmentation, or possibly a minor facelift to tighten up the area under the chin and bring it into proper alignment with the rest of the face. Chin augmentation can also sharpen the neck angle, help eradicate sagging jowls, and generally streamline the entire chin and neck area to bring the face into proportion. The most common non-surgical treatment in chin augmentation are filler injections &#8211; still the leading procedure due to its quick and simple steps of enhancing one\u2019s appearance.</p>\n<p>As is always the case in any health matter, it is best to speak to your GP or health care professional about your concerns\u00a0and to seek their advice before taking any action.</p>\n<p>Kybella is set for release in June 2015.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr /><p>test</p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.australianscience.com.au/news/fda-approved-an-injection-that-will-eliminate-your-double-chin/\">FDA Approved an Injection That Will Eliminate Your Double Chin</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.australianscience.com.au\">Australian Science</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n\r\n<!-- Performance optimized by W3 Total Cache.
