Utahns are known for hard work, innovation, and our can-do pioneering spirit. But more than these, we&rsquo;re known as a people who serve, who care, and who rise to any occasion.&rdquo;</p><p>It goes on like this for more than two minutes. One reporter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PhilipRucker/status/964495366308712448\">joked on Twitter</a> that he lost count of how many times Romney said &ldquo;Utah.&rdquo; The strategy <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/15/mitt-romney-utah-senate-hatch-410352\">telegraphed</a> in <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/02/romney-utah-campaign/553472/\">recent days</a> is clear and multipronged: Romney, who fell short in two previous White House bids and emerged as one of Donald Trump&rsquo;s fiercest critics, is trying to persuade voters that he is laser-focused on his adopted state and not on the president or the job he&rsquo;s pined for in the past.</p><p>Though on paper this should be a cakewalk &mdash; Romney is hardly a stranger in Utah, and Democrats have little chance of picking up the seat &mdash; two prominent Republicans have made an issue of Romney&rsquo;s Trump-bashing and his relocation to the West. One of them, State Auditor John Dougall, told BuzzFeed News that GOP activists in and outside Utah have been encouraging him after <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2018-02-14/utah-senate-race-state-auditor-john-dougall-may-challenge-mitt-romney\">he said this week</a> that he was seriously considering challenging Romney.</p><p>&ldquo;Some of the key things in Utah are that we want to make sure we have a senator who understands Utah issues, and those are clearly different than Massachusetts issues, for instance,&rdquo; Dougall said Friday morning in a brief telephone interview.</p><p>Dougall added that Romney had called him Thursday evening to inform him of his imminent announcement, which has been anticipated since Sen. Orrin Hatch made his retirement plans known last month. &ldquo;I wished him all the best,&rdquo; Dougall said of Romney.</p><p>A Romney spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Dougall declined to say who is encouraging him to run. But he suggested support would come from those concerned about electing someone who would not be aligned with Trump. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/johndougall/posts/10214531096981667\">For weeks on his Facebook page</a>, Dougall has been arguing against a &ldquo;coronation&rdquo; of Romney.</p><p>&ldquo;What we need is not somebody who doesn&rsquo;t like the president,&rdquo; Dougall told BuzzFeed News. &ldquo;I think the key thing right now is folks need to know what he stands for.&rdquo;</p><p>After the phone interview, Dougall added via email: &ldquo;I should have also mentioned that &lsquo;It&#39;s clear that Utahns have a very favorable view of Mr. Romney.

Utahns are known for hard work, innovation, and our can-do pioneering spirit. But more than these, we&#x26;rsquo;re known as a people who serve, who care, and who rise to any occasion.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;It goes on like this for more than two minutes. One reporter &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/PhilipRucker/status/964495366308712448&#x22;&#x3E;joked on Twitter&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that he lost count of how many times Romney said &#x26;ldquo;Utah.&#x26;rdquo; The strategy &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/15/mitt-romney-utah-senate-hatch-410352&#x22;&#x3E;telegraphed&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/02/romney-utah-campaign/553472/&#x22;&#x3E;recent days&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is clear and multipronged: Romney, who fell short in two previous White House bids and emerged as one of Donald Trump&#x26;rsquo;s fiercest critics, is trying to persuade voters that he is laser-focused on his adopted state and not on the president or the job he&#x26;rsquo;s pined for in the past.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Though on paper this should be a cakewalk &#x26;mdash; Romney is hardly a stranger in Utah, and Democrats have little chance of picking up the seat &#x26;mdash; two prominent Republicans have made an issue of Romney&#x26;rsquo;s Trump-bashing and his relocation to the West. One of them, State Auditor John Dougall, told BuzzFeed News that GOP activists in and outside Utah have been encouraging him after &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2018-02-14/utah-senate-race-state-auditor-john-dougall-may-challenge-mitt-romney&#x22;&#x3E;he said this week&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that he was seriously considering challenging Romney.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Some of the key things in Utah are that we want to make sure we have a senator who understands Utah issues, and those are clearly different than Massachusetts issues, for instance,&#x26;rdquo; Dougall said Friday morning in a brief telephone interview.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Dougall added that Romney had called him Thursday evening to inform him of his imminent announcement, which has been anticipated since Sen. Orrin Hatch made his retirement plans known last month. &#x26;ldquo;I wished him all the best,&#x26;rdquo; Dougall said of Romney.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;A Romney spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Dougall declined to say who is encouraging him to run. But he suggested support would come from those concerned about electing someone who would not be aligned with Trump. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.facebook.com/johndougall/posts/10214531096981667&#x22;&#x3E;For weeks on his Facebook page&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, Dougall has been arguing against a &#x26;ldquo;coronation&#x26;rdquo; of Romney.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;What we need is not somebody who doesn&#x26;rsquo;t like the president,&#x26;rdquo; Dougall told BuzzFeed News. &#x26;ldquo;I think the key thing right now is folks need to know what he stands for.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;After the phone interview, Dougall added via email: &#x26;ldquo;I should have also mentioned that &#x26;lsquo;It&#x26;#39;s clear that Utahns have a very favorable view of Mr. Romney. The odds are strongly in his favor.&#x26;rsquo;&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Earlier this week, Utah Republican Party Chair Rob Anderson noted Romney&#x26;rsquo;s criticism of Trump and spoke dismissively of his Utah credentials in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2018/02/14/utahs-republican-chairman-slams-mitt-romney-and-his-expected-senate-bid-compares-him-to-hillary-clinton/&#x22;&#x3E;an interview with the Salt Lake Tribune&#x3C;/a&#x3E;: &#x26;ldquo;I think he&#x26;rsquo;s keeping out candidates that I think would be a better fit for Utah because, let&#x26;rsquo;s face it, Mitt Romney doesn&#x26;rsquo;t live here, his kids weren&#x26;rsquo;t born here, he doesn&#x26;rsquo;t shop here.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Anderson later apologized to Romney.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;I&#x26;rsquo;ve no doubt that Mitt Romney satisfies all qualifications to run for Senate,&#x26;rdquo; said Anderson in a Wednesday statement &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/RobAndersonF15/status/963921923880116224/photo/1&#x22;&#x3E;posted on Twitter&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x26;ldquo;and as chairman of the Utah Republican Party, I will treat all candidates equally to ensure their path to the party nomination is honest and fair.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n</media:group>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>Federal Grand Jury In Special Counsel Probe Indicts Russian Troll Farm And Individuals For 2016 Election Meddling</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/federal-grand-jury-indicts-russian-agency-and-individuals?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-02/16/12/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/sub-buzz-17173-1518803962-1.jpg?resize=720:494\" width=\"720\" height=\"494\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Aaron P. Bernstein / Reuters</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The special counsel&#39;s office announced a federal indictment against the Russian-based Internet Research Agency (IRA), two other Russian entities, and <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/hayesbrown/these-are-the-russians-charged-with-meddling-in-the-2016?utm_term=.pvvpXBymv#.sjjeyNJrB\">13 Russian individuals</a> Friday, accusing them of \"interfering with the US political and electoral processes, including the presidential election of 2016.\"</p><p>The special counsel&#39;s office, which is investigating Russian interference in the election, provided the following statement:</p>\n\n<p>A federal grand jury in the District of Columbia returned an indictment on Feb. 16, 2018, against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities accused of violating U.S. criminal laws in order to interfere with U.S. elections and political processes. The indictment charges all of the defendants with conspiracy to defraud the United States, three defendants with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, and five defendants with aggravated identity theft.</p>\n\n<p>Beginning in 2014, according to the indictment, the IRA began \"operations to interfere with the US political system,\" including by \"creating false US personas\" to operate \"social media pages and groups designed to attract US audiences\" and \"traveling to the United States under false pretenses for the purpose of collecting intelligence to inform Defendants&#39; operations.\"</p><p>By mid-2016, the operations, according to the indictment \"included supporting the presidential campaign of then-candidate Donald J. Trump (\"Trump Campaign\") and disparaging Hillary Clinton.\" Specifically, \"Some Defendants, posing as US persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump Campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities.\"</p><p>At a news conference Friday afternoon, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is overseeing the special counsel&#39;s work due to Attorney General Jeff Sessions&#39; recusal, announced the indictment sought by Mueller &mdash; laying out the alleged social media efforts and the alleged fraudulent ways in which the effort was organized and implemented. He said the defendants had characterized their activities as \"information warfare against the United States, with the stated goal of spreading distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general.\"</p><p>The indictment charges the IRA and others with a conspiracy to defraud the United States. Rosenstein specifically noted how the efforts included efforts to defraud the Federal Election Commission, Justice Department, and State Department. The additional charges &mdash; against some but not all of the defendants &mdash; include conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, as well as several counts alleging identity theft.<br /></p><p>Rosenstein said on Friday that there were no allegations in the indictment \"that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity\" &mdash; he said the Russian nationals charged took \"extraordinary steps\" to make it appear that they were ordinary activists &mdash; or that the alleged criminal acts had \"any effect on the outcome of the election.\"</p><p>\"This indictment serves as a reminder that people are not always who they appear to be on the internet,\" Rosenstein said.</p><p>Several hours after Rosenstein announced the indictment, President Donald Trump tweeted, \"Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President,\" and he repeated his oft-made declaration that there was \"no collusion.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n <p><small>@realDonaldTrump via Twitter / Via <a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/964594780088033282\">Twitter: @realDonaldTrump</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement that Trump \"is glad to see the Special Counsel&rsquo;s investigation further indicates &mdash; that there was NO COLLUSION between the Trump campaign and Russia and that the outcome of the election was not changed or affected.<b>\"</b></p><p>According to the indictment, social media entities associated with the IRA &ldquo;contacted people through large social media groups focused on U.S. politics.&rdquo; The statement is consistent with <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryancbrooks/black-activists-are-outraged-after-reports-that-they-were?utm_term=.frZ55WQOy#.spEvvBOlx\">information</a> reported by BuzzFeed News this past fall.</p><p>Regarding the charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, the Justice Department charged three IRA members for allegedly using stolen identities to open accounts at a bank and online payments company PayPal. The indictment noted that the defendants allegedly used the names, addresses, social security numbers, and birth dates of unwitting people to open four accounts at an unidentified US financial institution in the summer of 2016.<br /></p><p>Some of that same information was used to register four accounts at PayPal, which according to its website, only requires a bank account and an email address to sign up. The defendants also allegedly opened 14 other PayPal accounts by buying credit card numbers and bank information that had been created with the stolen identities of real people. That operation used a combination of 14 unique bank accounts, six banks, and 11 email addresses.</p><p>&ldquo;PayPal is intensely focused on combatting and preventing the illicit use of our services,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement. \"We work closely with law enforcement, and did so in this matter, to identify, investigate and stop improper or potentially illegal activity.&rdquo;</p><p>The indictment notes that stolen identities were used to maintain the PayPal accounts, as well as accounts on unnamed cryptocurrency exchanges. Accounts at an unknown bank and with PayPal were used to pay for &ldquo;certain organization expenses&rdquo; such as advertisements on Facebook to promote its social media presences. Other expenses included paraphernalia including &ldquo;buttons, flags, and banners for rallies.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Some of the accounts were also used to receive money from US citizens for promotions and advertisements on IRA-owned social media pages. The defendants charged some US businesses $25 to $50 per promotional post on its fake accounts &mdash; including Being Patriotic, Defend The 2nd, and Blacktivist.</p><p>In October 2016, as BuzzFeed News previously <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryancbrooks/black-activists-are-outraged-after-reports-that-they-were?utm_term=.gtRGVjrdz#.jjxwZ2XWG\">reported</a>, Russian trolls contacted activists associated with legitimate grassroots organizations through a fictitious Facebook page, BlackMattersUS, to plan and speak at protest in Charlotte, NC following the shooting of Keith Scott, a black man killed by police. After the initial rally, the page remained in contact with an activist and invited them to a &ldquo;Charlotte Against Trump&rdquo; protest on November 19, 2016. The indictment information echoes the date detailed in another earlier BuzzFeed News <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryancbrooks/this-russian-campaign-turned-against-trump-in-the-days?utm_term=.qvGeexVR9#.supXXK0p9\">report.</a> The same group also organized a second &ldquo;Charlotte Against Trump&rdquo; rally on November 26, 2016, according to flyers and posts from the BlackMattersUS site.<br /></p><p>Facebook pages associated with the Internet Research Agency also promoted a similar rally against then president-elect Donald Trump in New York on November 12, 2016, which was attended by thousands of New Yorkers who marched from Union Square to Trump Tower, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryancbrooks/thousands-of-new-yorkers-took-to-the-streets-in-anti-trump?utm_term=.xrzQr0JZe#.vl0Kk43WD\">reported</a> on previously by BuzzFeed News and described in the indictment. A protest against the electoral college and Donald Trump, not mentioned in the indictment, was planned by another IRA-associated account on Dec. 3, 2016 in Union Square.</p><p>Some of these <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/lamvo/russia-targeted-election-ads?utm_term=.ic2pZKXgQ#.crZ0gPEZ5\">sites</a> and activities were <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/emmaloop/here-are-some-of-the-facebook-ads-linked-to-a-russian-troll?utm_term=.ndxbO4azn#.hn1KpDdZR\">described</a> as part of congressional investigations looking into the Russian interference.<br /></p><p>Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement that the indictment was \"an important step to hold Russia accountable.\" He noted that senior intelligence officials had testified earlier this week that Russia was \"still using social media to attack our democratic institutions and sow division amongst Americans,\" and he expressed frustration with the extent of the intelligence community&#39;s efforts to monitor Russian disinformation campaigns.</p><p>Special Counsel Robert Mueller&#39;s investigation \"is ongoing,\" Rosenstein said. He did not provide any additional details. Rosenstein did not respond to shouted questions at the end of the press conference about whether the indicted defendants had a connection to the Russian government or Russian intelligence operations.</p><p>Asked if the United States had received any assurances from the Russian government about turning over the charged individuals into US custody, Rosenstein said there had been no communications with the Russians about that. The US government would pursue the normal process of seeking extradition, he said.</p><h1>A new guilty plea</h1><p>The special counsel&#39;s office on Friday also unsealed a <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4380605/2-12-18-Pinedo-Statement-of-Offense.pdf\">criminal case</a> against Richard Pinedo, a California man who pleaded guilty to one count of identity fraud. According to the documents outlining the offense, Pinedo ran a company called \"Auction Essistance\" that was \"designed to circumvent the security features of large online digital payment companies.\" Pinedo would buy and sell bank account numbers, including many that were created using stolen identities, according to court filings.</p><p>Pinedo&#39;s charging papers don&#39;t reference the Internet Research Agency, but the IRA indictment accuses the defendants in that case of buying credit card and bank account numbers from online sellers to evade security measures at PayPal &mdash; language that is similar to the special counsel office&#39;s description of the activities that Pinedo was accused of facilitating.</p><p>The timing of the announcement also indicates the two cases are related. Prosecutors <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4380609/2-7-18-US-Motion-to-Seal-Pinedo.pdf\">asked to</a> have Pinedo&#39;s case sealed when they first filed the charging papers on Feb. 7, according to the now-public court docket. They explained to the judge that temporarily sealing proceedings and documents in the case was necessary to avoid possible prejudice to the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, particularly into \"a Russian-backed operation that used social media platforms, through fraud and deceit, to interfere with the U.S. political system.\"</p><p>Pinedo was arraigned during a sealed hearing on Feb. 12. On Friday, the special counsel&#39;s office asked the judge to <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4380610/2-16-18-US-Motion-to-Unseal-Pinedo.pdf\">unseal the case</a>.</p><p>Pinedo&#39;s lawyer, Jeremy Lessem, said in a statement that Pinedo had \"accepted full responsibility for his action\" but \"had absolutely no knowledge of the identities and motivations of any of the purchasers of the information he provided.\"</p><p>\"To the extent that Mr. Pinedo&rsquo;s actions assisted any individuals, including foreign nationals, from interfering in the American presidential election was done completely without his knowledge or understanding,\" Lessem said.</p><p>A spokesman for the special counsel&#39;s office, Peter Carr, said in an email to BuzzFeed News that, \"Ricky Pinedo admitted in his plea to selling bank account numbers over the internet, and that he knew many of the buyers were outside the United States. We have no evidence and there is no allegation he was a witting participant in the Russian efforts to interfere in U.S. elections and political processes.&rdquo;</p><p>While the Auction Essistance site has been been taken offline for maintenance, <a href=\"https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:wvZEZgyCPUwJ:https://auctionessistance.com/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us\">a cached version</a> of the web page show offers for customers to buy &ldquo;stealth accounts&rdquo; on eBay and PayPal for as little as $35. &ldquo;We offer services that will enable you to get back onto eBay or Amazon ranging from pre-made eBay &amp; Paypal accounts or verification tools,&rdquo; the website read. &ldquo;We guarantee our accounts are legitimate and not hacked or stolen like most other sellers offer.&rdquo;</p><p>BuzzFeed News could not reach Pinedo at a Santa Paula, Calif. phone number listed for him, which had been turned off. An internet search for Auction Essistance shows a still accessible <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/auction-essistance/\">LinkedIn page</a> and an <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/AuctionEssistance/getting-back-on-e-bay-paypal-slideshare\">online slideshow presentation</a> detailing a step-by-step process for what users could do if they had been banned from eBay.

Against spying and counter-spying, against the latest methods and technologies? ... Absurd? Yes. But this is the modern American political reality.\"<br /></p><p>Evengy Prigozhin, who is listed as a defendant in the indictment as the owner of the Internet Research Agency, <a href=\"https://ria.ru/world/20180216/1514817568.html\">appeared nonchalant</a> when speaking to Russian outlet RIA. \"Americans are very impressionable people, they see what they want to see,\" he said. \"I relate to them with great respect.

Bernstein / Reuters&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;The special counsel&#x26;#39;s office announced a federal indictment against the Russian-based Internet Research Agency (IRA), two other Russian entities, and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/hayesbrown/these-are-the-russians-charged-with-meddling-in-the-2016?utm_term=.pvvpXBymv#.sjjeyNJrB&#x22;&#x3E;13 Russian individuals&#x3C;/a&#x3E; Friday, accusing them of &#x22;interfering with the US political and electoral processes, including the presidential election of 2016.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The special counsel&#x26;#39;s office, which is investigating Russian interference in the election, provided the following statement:&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;A federal grand jury in the District of Columbia returned an indictment on Feb. 16, 2018, against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities accused of violating U.S. criminal laws in order to interfere with U.S. elections and political processes. The indictment charges all of the defendants with conspiracy to defraud the United States, three defendants with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, and five defendants with aggravated identity theft.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;Beginning in 2014, according to the indictment, the IRA began &#x22;operations to interfere with the US political system,&#x22; including by &#x22;creating false US personas&#x22; to operate &#x22;social media pages and groups designed to attract US audiences&#x22; and &#x22;traveling to the United States under false pretenses for the purpose of collecting intelligence to inform Defendants&#x26;#39; operations.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;By mid-2016, the operations, according to the indictment &#x22;included supporting the presidential campaign of then-candidate Donald J. Trump (&#x22;Trump Campaign&#x22;) and disparaging Hillary Clinton.&#x22; Specifically, &#x22;Some Defendants, posing as US persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump Campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;At a news conference Friday afternoon, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is overseeing the special counsel&#x26;#39;s work due to Attorney General Jeff Sessions&#x26;#39; recusal, announced the indictment sought by Mueller &#x26;mdash; laying out the alleged social media efforts and the alleged fraudulent ways in which the effort was organized and implemented. He said the defendants had characterized their activities as &#x22;information warfare against the United States, with the stated goal of spreading distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The indictment charges the IRA and others with a conspiracy to defraud the United States. Rosenstein specifically noted how the efforts included efforts to defraud the Federal Election Commission, Justice Department, and State Department. The additional charges &#x26;mdash; against some but not all of the defendants &#x26;mdash; include conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, as well as several counts alleging identity theft.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Rosenstein said on Friday that there were no allegations in the indictment &#x22;that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity&#x22; &#x26;mdash; he said the Russian nationals charged took &#x22;extraordinary steps&#x22; to make it appear that they were ordinary activists &#x26;mdash; or that the alleged criminal acts had &#x22;any effect on the outcome of the election.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;This indictment serves as a reminder that people are not always who they appear to be on the internet,&#x22; Rosenstein said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Several hours after Rosenstein announced the indictment, President Donald Trump tweeted, &#x22;Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President,&#x22; and he repeated his oft-made declaration that there was &#x22;no collusion.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;@realDonaldTrump via Twitter / Via &#x3C;a rel=&#x22;nofollow&#x22;  target=&#x22;_blank&#x22;  href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/964594780088033282&#x22;&#x3E;Twitter: @realDonaldTrump&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement that Trump &#x22;is glad to see the Special Counsel&#x26;rsquo;s investigation further indicates &#x26;mdash; that there was NO COLLUSION between the Trump campaign and Russia and that the outcome of the election was not changed or affected.&#x3C;b&#x3E;&#x22;&#x3C;/b&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;According to the indictment, social media entities associated with the IRA &#x26;ldquo;contacted people through large social media groups focused on U.S. politics.&#x26;rdquo; The statement is consistent with &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryancbrooks/black-activists-are-outraged-after-reports-that-they-were?utm_term=.frZ55WQOy#.spEvvBOlx&#x22;&#x3E;information&#x3C;/a&#x3E; reported by BuzzFeed News this past fall.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Regarding the charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, the Justice Department charged three IRA members for allegedly using stolen identities to open accounts at a bank and online payments company PayPal. The indictment noted that the defendants allegedly used the names, addresses, social security numbers, and birth dates of unwitting people to open four accounts at an unidentified US financial institution in the summer of 2016.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Some of that same information was used to register four accounts at PayPal, which according to its website, only requires a bank account and an email address to sign up. The defendants also allegedly opened 14 other PayPal accounts by buying credit card numbers and bank information that had been created with the stolen identities of real people. That operation used a combination of 14 unique bank accounts, six banks, and 11 email addresses.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;PayPal is intensely focused on combatting and preventing the illicit use of our services,&#x22; a company spokesperson said in a statement. &#x22;We work closely with law enforcement, and did so in this matter, to identify, investigate and stop improper or potentially illegal activity.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The indictment notes that stolen identities were used to maintain the PayPal accounts, as well as accounts on unnamed cryptocurrency exchanges. Accounts at an unknown bank and with PayPal were used to pay for &#x26;ldquo;certain organization expenses&#x26;rdquo; such as advertisements on Facebook to promote its social media presences. Other expenses included paraphernalia including &#x26;ldquo;buttons, flags, and banners for rallies.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Some of the accounts were also used to receive money from US citizens for promotions and advertisements on IRA-owned social media pages. The defendants charged some US businesses $25 to $50 per promotional post on its fake accounts &#x26;mdash; including Being Patriotic, Defend The 2nd, and Blacktivist.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;In October 2016, as BuzzFeed News previously &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryancbrooks/black-activists-are-outraged-after-reports-that-they-were?utm_term=.gtRGVjrdz#.jjxwZ2XWG&#x22;&#x3E;reported&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, Russian trolls contacted activists associated with legitimate grassroots organizations through a fictitious Facebook page, BlackMattersUS, to plan and speak at protest in Charlotte, NC following the shooting of Keith Scott, a black man killed by police. After the initial rally, the page remained in contact with an activist and invited them to a &#x26;ldquo;Charlotte Against Trump&#x26;rdquo; protest on November 19, 2016. The indictment information echoes the date detailed in another earlier BuzzFeed News &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryancbrooks/this-russian-campaign-turned-against-trump-in-the-days?utm_term=.qvGeexVR9#.supXXK0p9&#x22;&#x3E;report.&#x3C;/a&#x3E; The same group also organized a second &#x26;ldquo;Charlotte Against Trump&#x26;rdquo; rally on November 26, 2016, according to flyers and posts from the BlackMattersUS site.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Facebook pages associated with the Internet Research Agency also promoted a similar rally against then president-elect Donald Trump in New York on November 12, 2016, which was attended by thousands of New Yorkers who marched from Union Square to Trump Tower, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryancbrooks/thousands-of-new-yorkers-took-to-the-streets-in-anti-trump?utm_term=.xrzQr0JZe#.vl0Kk43WD&#x22;&#x3E;reported&#x3C;/a&#x3E; on previously by BuzzFeed News and described in the indictment. A protest against the electoral college and Donald Trump, not mentioned in the indictment, was planned by another IRA-associated account on Dec. 3, 2016 in Union Square.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Some of these &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/lamvo/russia-targeted-election-ads?utm_term=.ic2pZKXgQ#.crZ0gPEZ5&#x22;&#x3E;sites&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and activities were &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/emmaloop/here-are-some-of-the-facebook-ads-linked-to-a-russian-troll?utm_term=.ndxbO4azn#.hn1KpDdZR&#x22;&#x3E;described&#x3C;/a&#x3E; as part of congressional investigations looking into the Russian interference.&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement that the indictment was &#x22;an important step to hold Russia accountable.&#x22; He noted that senior intelligence officials had testified earlier this week that Russia was &#x22;still using social media to attack our democratic institutions and sow division amongst Americans,&#x22; and he expressed frustration with the extent of the intelligence community&#x26;#39;s efforts to monitor Russian disinformation campaigns.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Special Counsel Robert Mueller&#x26;#39;s investigation &#x22;is ongoing,&#x22; Rosenstein said. He did not provide any additional details. Rosenstein did not respond to shouted questions at the end of the press conference about whether the indicted defendants had a connection to the Russian government or Russian intelligence operations.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Asked if the United States had received any assurances from the Russian government about turning over the charged individuals into US custody, Rosenstein said there had been no communications with the Russians about that. The US government would pursue the normal process of seeking extradition, he said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;h1&#x3E;A new guilty plea&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The special counsel&#x26;#39;s office on Friday also unsealed a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4380605/2-12-18-Pinedo-Statement-of-Offense.pdf&#x22;&#x3E;criminal case&#x3C;/a&#x3E; against Richard Pinedo, a California man who pleaded guilty to one count of identity fraud. According to the documents outlining the offense, Pinedo ran a company called &#x22;Auction Essistance&#x22; that was &#x22;designed to circumvent the security features of large online digital payment companies.&#x22; Pinedo would buy and sell bank account numbers, including many that were created using stolen identities, according to court filings.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Pinedo&#x26;#39;s charging papers don&#x26;#39;t reference the Internet Research Agency, but the IRA indictment accuses the defendants in that case of buying credit card and bank account numbers from online sellers to evade security measures at PayPal &#x26;mdash; language that is similar to the special counsel office&#x26;#39;s description of the activities that Pinedo was accused of facilitating.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The timing of the announcement also indicates the two cases are related. Prosecutors &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4380609/2-7-18-US-Motion-to-Seal-Pinedo.pdf&#x22;&#x3E;asked to&#x3C;/a&#x3E; have Pinedo&#x26;#39;s case sealed when they first filed the charging papers on Feb. 7, according to the now-public court docket. They explained to the judge that temporarily sealing proceedings and documents in the case was necessary to avoid possible prejudice to the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, particularly into &#x22;a Russian-backed operation that used social media platforms, through fraud and deceit, to interfere with the U.S. political system.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Pinedo was arraigned during a sealed hearing on Feb. 12. On Friday, the special counsel&#x26;#39;s office asked the judge to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4380610/2-16-18-US-Motion-to-Unseal-Pinedo.pdf&#x22;&#x3E;unseal the case&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Pinedo&#x26;#39;s lawyer, Jeremy Lessem, said in a statement that Pinedo had &#x22;accepted full responsibility for his action&#x22; but &#x22;had absolutely no knowledge of the identities and motivations of any of the purchasers of the information he provided.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;To the extent that Mr. Pinedo&#x26;rsquo;s actions assisted any individuals, including foreign nationals, from interfering in the American presidential election was done completely without his knowledge or understanding,&#x22; Lessem said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;A spokesman for the special counsel&#x26;#39;s office, Peter Carr, said in an email to BuzzFeed News that, &#x22;Ricky Pinedo admitted in his plea to selling bank account numbers over the internet, and that he knew many of the buyers were outside the United States. We have no evidence and there is no allegation he was a witting participant in the Russian efforts to interfere in U.S. elections and political processes.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;While the Auction Essistance site has been been taken offline for maintenance, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:wvZEZgyCPUwJ:https://auctionessistance.com/+&#x26;amp;cd=1&#x26;amp;hl=en&#x26;amp;ct=clnk&#x26;amp;gl=us&#x22;&#x3E;a cached version&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of the web page show offers for customers to buy &#x26;ldquo;stealth accounts&#x26;rdquo; on eBay and PayPal for as little as $35. &#x26;ldquo;We offer services that will enable you to get back onto eBay or Amazon ranging from pre-made eBay &#x26;amp; Paypal accounts or verification tools,&#x26;rdquo; the website read. &#x26;ldquo;We guarantee our accounts are legitimate and not hacked or stolen like most other sellers offer.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;BuzzFeed News could not reach Pinedo at a Santa Paula, Calif. phone number listed for him, which had been turned off.

Maria Zakharova, the spokesperson for Russia&#x26;#39;s foreign ministry, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.facebook.com/maria.zakharova.167/posts/10215924600217567&#x22;&#x3E;posted on Facebook&#x3C;/a&#x3E; calling the idea that 13 people had taken on the US government &#x22;absurd.&#x22;&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;It seems there were 13, in the opinion of the US Justice Department,&#x22; she wrote. &#x22;13 people took part in meddling in the US election?&#x26;#33; 13 against the billions-dollar budget of the special services? Against spying and counter-spying, against the latest methods and technologies? ... Absurd? Yes. But this is the modern American political reality.&#x22;&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Evengy Prigozhin, who is listed as a defendant in the indictment as the owner of the Internet Research Agency, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://ria.ru/world/20180216/1514817568.html&#x22;&#x3E;appeared nonchalant&#x3C;/a&#x3E; when speaking to Russian outlet RIA. &#x22;Americans are very impressionable people, they see what they want to see,&#x22; he said. &#x22;I relate to them with great respect.

The judge said Trump administration officials were incorrectly arguing that an &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; privilege &mdash; meaning one that the judge could not rule against &mdash; protected the administration from having to turn over certain information regarding meetings or conversations the president had in advance of <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/coralewis/trump-transgender-military-service?utm_term=.uu82ZEJ7R#.we3PEv6kz\">his July 26, 2017, tweets</a> announcing an end to transgender military service.</p><p>&ldquo;After consultation with my Generals and military experts,&rdquo; Trump wrote in a series of three tweets, &ldquo;please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>Nearly a month later, Trump issued <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/trump-issues-policy-directing-an-end-to-open-transgender?utm_term=.ri1qNZ4WY#.rrO6wJ3LA\">a further policy</a> that directed the end of transgender service this year.</p><p>In a docket entry detailing the outcome of a telephone conference, US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly stated that she hopes to move the issues forward in a follow-up telephone conference Friday. The judge laid out that both sides should be ready to discuss issues relating to two types of executive privilege raised by the Justice Department in the case: information the federal government &ldquo;contend[s] is covered by the presidential communications privilege&rdquo; and a dispute &ldquo;regarding the deliberative process privilege.&rdquo;</p><p>Executive privilege, while a term familiar to most Americans, is much more complicated &mdash; and dependent on the facts of specific cases &mdash; than often portrayed. It&rsquo;s a rarely invoked set of different, but related, privileges that are available to protect executive communications from disclosure to courts, Congress, and often &mdash; ultimately &mdash; the public.</p><p>Often, the privileges, even if they cover the communication, are not enough to keep some documents from being turned over or testimony from being compelled if the information at issue is necessary for a congressional or legal matter to be able to proceed, it isn&#39;t available elsewhere, and the branch seeking the information is willing to fight for it. At the same time, judicial and congressional officials often negotiate out executive privilege&ndash;related disputes before they get to a final court ruling, due to concerns about separation of powers &mdash; meaning there isn&#39;t always clearly established law on specific executive privilege&ndash;related issues.</p><p>The presidential communications privilege and deliberative process privilege have related purposes: keeping executive branch decision-making private. As the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit put it in <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-dc-circuit/1433973.html\">a 1997 case</a>, &ldquo;Both are executive privileges designed to protect executive branch decisionmaking, but one applies to decisionmaking of executive officials generally, the other specifically to decisionmaking of the President&rdquo; and his senior advisers, as the court held in that opinion.</p><p>Of the two, the deliberative process privilege is more limited. It only protects &ldquo;predecisional&rdquo; material that is &ldquo;deliberative&rdquo; in nature, like drafts of materials and policy recommendations to superiors. Because of these limits, factual material, like raw data collected by an agency, generally is not protected &mdash; and the privilege can be overcome with &ldquo;a sufficient showing of need&rdquo; for the material by the requesting party. Notably, the privilege generally does not protect against disclosure when misconduct is alleged.</p><p>The presidential communications privilege, on the other hand, is a more robust privilege that the Supreme Court addressed in <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/418/683.html\">the 1974 case over then-president Nixon&rsquo;s White House audio tapes</a> &mdash; and whether a court could order that they be turned over for a pending criminal trial of one of Nixon&rsquo;s associates. The Nixon administration &mdash; citing the importance of protecting &ldquo;the independence of the Executive Branch within its own sphere&rdquo; &mdash; claimed an absolute privilege against disclosing the tapes as part of an ongoing criminal prosecution.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-02/16/1/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/sub-buzz-21629-1518761412-1.jpg?resize=720:507\" width=\"720\" height=\"507\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>Former president Richard Nixon</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Handout / Reuters</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The Supreme Court held that &ldquo;high respect&rdquo; must be given &ldquo;to the representations made on behalf of the President&rdquo; &mdash; justifying a &ldquo;presumptive privilege&rdquo; for presidential communications, including factual communications. The court nonetheless ruled that a &ldquo;generalized&rdquo; assertion of the presidential communications privilege is not absolute and must be weighed against the need for the material by the other party seeking it &mdash; whether it be a court or Congress. In the Nixon case, the court held that the &ldquo;demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial&rdquo; outweighed Nixon&rsquo;s invocation of executive privilege.</p><p>In the case over the transgender military policy, the Justice Department lawyer, Ryan Parker, raised the presidential communications privilege in response to a request from the challengers, who have asked for information from the president about the identities of the consulted general and military experts referenced in the tweets, and what relevant meetings and conversations took place about the issue.</p><p>&ldquo;[Y]ou&#39;ve taken the position, it seems to me, or almost the position that it&#39;s an absolute privilege, and that&#39;s not correct,&rdquo; Kollar-Kotelly said, criticizing the Justice Department&rsquo;s position. At another point, she explained further: &ldquo;[I]f you assert [the presidential communications privilege], it&#39;s presumptively so, but that is not the end of the inquiry. And the problem that I&#39;m having is, you&#39;re not willing to have the rest of the inquiry with me.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>As a way of addressing the government&rsquo;s concerns, Kollar-Kotelly discussed the possibility of the department turning over a log detailing the relevant meetings and conversations &mdash; not the content of the communications, just the fact of their existence &mdash; for her to review in an effort to determine if the privilege applies, but the DOJ lawyer kept insisting that the department&rsquo;s position was that such a document would be covered by the privilege.</p><p>The DOJ lawyer didn&rsquo;t budge.</p><p>After significant back and forth, the judge said, &ldquo;I&#39;m not talking about giving it to the plaintiffs. You keep going back to the plaintiffs. I am talking about giving it to the Court so the Court can make a decision as to whether or not this actually falls into the presidential communications privilege.&rdquo; Finally, Kollar-Kotelly said, &ldquo;[A]nswer it yes or no and give me an explanation. Are you willing to provide any information whatsoever about what might have transpired?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your Honor, to answer in one word, the answer is no,&rdquo; Parker responded.</p><p>Concluding the discussion a few minutes later, Kollar-Kotelly said, &ldquo;I will figure out how I want to proceed with this, but this is not a good way to go about this.&rdquo;</p><p>The deliberative process privilege discussion, surrounding withheld documents and redactions to documents that have been turned over, was more brief and less contentious, focusing in large part on a dispute over what constitutes a &ldquo;decision&rdquo; &mdash; given that the privilege only protects predecisional matters.</p><p>The dispute, as Kollar-Kotelly put it, appeared to be over &ldquo;whether the tweet was the decision or the memorandum was the decision.&rdquo; She suggested that decision-making is fluid at times and that, &ldquo;instead of going off on whether the tweet is the final decision or his memorandum is the final decision,&rdquo; the lawyers should focus on whether the material at issue looks like the matter discussed is the type of material that usually would be seen as predecisional.</p><p>The challengers&rsquo; lawyer, Paul Wolfson from WilmerHale, said the government needed to specify what decision is at issue so it can be determined if the redacted material truly is predecisional or if it is &ldquo;really just people reacting to a decision that was already made, which would make it postdecisional.&rdquo;</p><p>Parker&rsquo;s response was a bit winding, but it, in effect, said that the tweets set off a cascading series of decisions &mdash; &ldquo;the tweet was a decision and that that decision itself gave rise to a series of additional decisions&rdquo; &mdash; and that the redacted materials are all &ldquo;deliberative material&rdquo; protected from disclosure because the redactions represent predecisional material as to at least one of those decisions.</p><p>Kollar-Kotelly asked the parties to confer on those issues in an attempt to narrow down the number of documents at issue before she has to determine how to address the privilege claims.</p><p>Over the course of the hearing, lawyers for both parties referenced letters that were submitted to the court and each other, laying out their positions on the arguments. Neither letter was posted on the court&#39;s docket, however, and both lawyers for the challengers and for the government declined to provide a copy of the letters to BuzzFeed News &mdash; saying the decision was up to the judge to make the letters public. On Friday morning, just before publication of this story, BuzzFeed News was informed that the court would be placing the letters on the docket at the request of the parties &mdash; but it had not done so by the time of publication.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>&ldquo;I will figure out how I want to proceed with this, but this is not a good way to go about this.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This week&rsquo;s court dispute is not the first time the Trump administration has raised the argument that documents sought in litigation should be protected from disclosure by executive privilege. In December, in the course of defending the administration&rsquo;s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, a discovery dispute arose in one of the challenges to the decision. A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to turn over documents in a challenge, claiming the decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/the-justice-department-goes-to-the-supreme-court-to-keep?utm_term=.pfxrVLbzj#.lcYXzDNgr\">went to the Supreme Court</a> to halt that order from being enforced, making several arguments regarding why the order was inappropriate, but one of its final arguments was that at least some of the documents were covered by executive privilege and should not have to be produced.</p><p>The Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/supreme-court-rules-the-trump-administration-doesnt-need-to?utm_term=.wkQraAv3N#.knBwqXA7b\">granted</a> the Justice Department&rsquo;s request on the grounds that the discovery order was premature, but the court added a warning regarding privilege issues. Near the conclusion of its order, the court noted, &ldquo;In any event, the District Court may not compel the Government to disclose any document that the Government believes is privileged without first providing the Government with the opportunity to argue the issue.&rdquo;</p><p>Of course, executive privilege issues also are expected to come up &mdash; and <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/emmaloop/bannon-again-refuses-to-answer-questions-contempt-finding?utm_term=.mrZ4glvw2#.bi46G5zad\">already are coming up</a> &mdash; in the course of the special counsel and congressional investigations into Russian influence into the 2016 presidential election. While these other disputes are important in their own right, the government&rsquo;s arguments in other cases shed light on what might be expected, should special counsel Robert Mueller seek information the administration doesn&rsquo;t want to turn over or, as could happen with Steve Bannon, if a chamber of Congress votes to hold someone in contempt in response to a refusal to answer questions or provide documents.</p>\n\n\n <p><small></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]]></description>\n<author>Chris Geidner</author>\n<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/the-trump-administration-is-arguing-it-can-keep-information</guid>\n<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 09:14:48 -0500</pubDate>\n<media:group>\n  <media:description type=\"html\">Asked in a pending lawsuit to turn over information about Trump&#x27;s tweeted claim that he consulted with &#x22;Generals and military experts&#x22; before announcing the ban, the Justice Department is raising executive privilege to try to keep that information secret &#x2014; incorrectly, a federal judge said in a hearing this week.</media:description>\n  <media:credit role=\"user\" scheme=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com\">chrisgeidner</media:credit>\n  <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  <media:content height=\"236\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/16/13/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/the-trump-administration-is-arguing-it-can-keep-i-2-27386-1518806224-12.jpg\" width=\"355\" />\n  <media:content isDefault=\"true\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-02/16/0/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-18822-1518759993-1.jpg?resize=720:491&#x22; width=&#x22;720&#x22; height=&#x22;491&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Mark Wilson / Getty Images&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;WASHINGTON &#x26;mdash; The Justice Department argued in court this week that officials don&#x26;rsquo;t have to turn over certain information and documents about President Trump&#x26;rsquo;s announced decision to bar transgender people from serving in the military &#x26;mdash; citing executive privilege.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The judge hearing one of the lawsuits challenging the policy pushed back against the Justice Department lawyer&#x26;#39;s claim.

At the same time, judicial and congressional officials often negotiate out executive privilege&#x26;ndash;related disputes before they get to a final court ruling, due to concerns about separation of powers &#x26;mdash; meaning there isn&#x26;#39;t always clearly established law on specific executive privilege&#x26;ndash;related issues.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The presidential communications privilege and deliberative process privilege have related purposes: keeping executive branch decision-making private. As the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit put it in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-dc-circuit/1433973.html&#x22;&#x3E;a 1997 case&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x26;ldquo;Both are executive privileges designed to protect executive branch decisionmaking, but one applies to decisionmaking of executive officials generally, the other specifically to decisionmaking of the President&#x26;rdquo; and his senior advisers, as the court held in that opinion.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Of the two, the deliberative process privilege is more limited. It only protects &#x26;ldquo;predecisional&#x26;rdquo; material that is &#x26;ldquo;deliberative&#x26;rdquo; in nature, like drafts of materials and policy recommendations to superiors. Because of these limits, factual material, like raw data collected by an agency, generally is not protected &#x26;mdash; and the privilege can be overcome with &#x26;ldquo;a sufficient showing of need&#x26;rdquo; for the material by the requesting party. Notably, the privilege generally does not protect against disclosure when misconduct is alleged.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The presidential communications privilege, on the other hand, is a more robust privilege that the Supreme Court addressed in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/418/683.html&#x22;&#x3E;the 1974 case over then-president Nixon&#x26;rsquo;s White House audio tapes&#x3C;/a&#x3E; &#x26;mdash; and whether a court could order that they be turned over for a pending criminal trial of one of Nixon&#x26;rsquo;s associates. The Nixon administration &#x26;mdash; citing the importance of protecting &#x26;ldquo;the independence of the Executive Branch within its own sphere&#x26;rdquo; &#x26;mdash; claimed an absolute privilege against disclosing the tapes as part of an ongoing criminal prosecution.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-02/16/1/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/sub-buzz-21629-1518761412-1.jpg?resize=720:507&#x22; width=&#x22;720&#x22; height=&#x22;507&#x22; alt=&#x22;&#x22; /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n \n\t&#x3C;p&#x3E;Former president Richard Nixon&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;Handout / Reuters&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;The Supreme Court held that &#x26;ldquo;high respect&#x26;rdquo; must be given &#x26;ldquo;to the representations made on behalf of the President&#x26;rdquo; &#x26;mdash; justifying a &#x26;ldquo;presumptive privilege&#x26;rdquo; for presidential communications, including factual communications. The court nonetheless ruled that a &#x26;ldquo;generalized&#x26;rdquo; assertion of the presidential communications privilege is not absolute and must be weighed against the need for the material by the other party seeking it &#x26;mdash; whether it be a court or Congress. In the Nixon case, the court held that the &#x26;ldquo;demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial&#x26;rdquo; outweighed Nixon&#x26;rsquo;s invocation of executive privilege.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the case over the transgender military policy, the Justice Department lawyer, Ryan Parker, raised the presidential communications privilege in response to a request from the challengers, who have asked for information from the president about the identities of the consulted general and military experts referenced in the tweets, and what relevant meetings and conversations took place about the issue.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;[Y]ou&#x26;#39;ve taken the position, it seems to me, or almost the position that it&#x26;#39;s an absolute privilege, and that&#x26;#39;s not correct,&#x26;rdquo; Kollar-Kotelly said, criticizing the Justice Department&#x26;rsquo;s position. At another point, she explained further: &#x26;ldquo;[I]f you assert [the presidential communications privilege], it&#x26;#39;s presumptively so, but that is not the end of the inquiry. And the problem that I&#x26;#39;m having is, you&#x26;#39;re not willing to have the rest of the inquiry with me.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;As a way of addressing the government&#x26;rsquo;s concerns, Kollar-Kotelly discussed the possibility of the department turning over a log detailing the relevant meetings and conversations &#x26;mdash; not the content of the communications, just the fact of their existence &#x26;mdash; for her to review in an effort to determine if the privilege applies, but the DOJ lawyer kept insisting that the department&#x26;rsquo;s position was that such a document would be covered by the privilege.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The DOJ lawyer didn&#x26;rsquo;t budge.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;After significant back and forth, the judge said, &#x26;ldquo;I&#x26;#39;m not talking about giving it to the plaintiffs. You keep going back to the plaintiffs. I am talking about giving it to the Court so the Court can make a decision as to whether or not this actually falls into the presidential communications privilege.&#x26;rdquo; Finally, Kollar-Kotelly said, &#x26;ldquo;[A]nswer it yes or no and give me an explanation. Are you willing to provide any information whatsoever about what might have transpired?&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Your Honor, to answer in one word, the answer is no,&#x26;rdquo; Parker responded.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Concluding the discussion a few minutes later, Kollar-Kotelly said, &#x26;ldquo;I will figure out how I want to proceed with this, but this is not a good way to go about this.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The deliberative process privilege discussion, surrounding withheld documents and redactions to documents that have been turned over, was more brief and less contentious, focusing in large part on a dispute over what constitutes a &#x26;ldquo;decision&#x26;rdquo; &#x26;mdash; given that the privilege only protects predecisional matters.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The dispute, as Kollar-Kotelly put it, appeared to be over &#x26;ldquo;whether the tweet was the decision or the memorandum was the decision.&#x26;rdquo; She suggested that decision-making is fluid at times and that, &#x26;ldquo;instead of going off on whether the tweet is the final decision or his memorandum is the final decision,&#x26;rdquo; the lawyers should focus on whether the material at issue looks like the matter discussed is the type of material that usually would be seen as predecisional.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The challengers&#x26;rsquo; lawyer, Paul Wolfson from WilmerHale, said the government needed to specify what decision is at issue so it can be determined if the redacted material truly is predecisional or if it is &#x26;ldquo;really just people reacting to a decision that was already made, which would make it postdecisional.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Parker&#x26;rsquo;s response was a bit winding, but it, in effect, said that the tweets set off a cascading series of decisions &#x26;mdash; &#x26;ldquo;the tweet was a decision and that that decision itself gave rise to a series of additional decisions&#x26;rdquo; &#x26;mdash; and that the redacted materials are all &#x26;ldquo;deliberative material&#x26;rdquo; protected from disclosure because the redactions represent predecisional material as to at least one of those decisions.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Kollar-Kotelly asked the parties to confer on those issues in an attempt to narrow down the number of documents at issue before she has to determine how to address the privilege claims.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Over the course of the hearing, lawyers for both parties referenced letters that were submitted to the court and each other, laying out their positions on the arguments. Neither letter was posted on the court&#x26;#39;s docket, however, and both lawyers for the challengers and for the government declined to provide a copy of the letters to BuzzFeed News &#x26;mdash; saying the decision was up to the judge to make the letters public. On Friday morning, just before publication of this story, BuzzFeed News was informed that the court would be placing the letters on the docket at the request of the parties &#x26;mdash; but it had not done so by the time of publication.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;I will figure out how I want to proceed with this, but this is not a good way to go about this.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;This week&#x26;rsquo;s court dispute is not the first time the Trump administration has raised the argument that documents sought in litigation should be protected from disclosure by executive privilege. In December, in the course of defending the administration&#x26;rsquo;s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, a discovery dispute arose in one of the challenges to the decision. A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to turn over documents in a challenge, claiming the decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The Justice Department &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/the-justice-department-goes-to-the-supreme-court-to-keep?utm_term=.pfxrVLbzj#.lcYXzDNgr&#x22;&#x3E;went to the Supreme Court&#x3C;/a&#x3E; to halt that order from being enforced, making several arguments regarding why the order was inappropriate, but one of its final arguments was that at least some of the documents were covered by executive privilege and should not have to be produced.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The Supreme Court &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/supreme-court-rules-the-trump-administration-doesnt-need-to?utm_term=.wkQraAv3N#.knBwqXA7b&#x22;&#x3E;granted&#x3C;/a&#x3E; the Justice Department&#x26;rsquo;s request on the grounds that the discovery order was premature, but the court added a warning regarding privilege issues. Near the conclusion of its order, the court noted, &#x26;ldquo;In any event, the District Court may not compel the Government to disclose any document that the Government believes is privileged without first providing the Government with the opportunity to argue the issue.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Of course, executive privilege issues also are expected to come up &#x26;mdash; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/emmaloop/bannon-again-refuses-to-answer-questions-contempt-finding?utm_term=.mrZ4glvw2#.bi46G5zad&#x22;&#x3E;already are coming up&#x3C;/a&#x3E; &#x26;mdash; in the course of the special counsel and congressional investigations into Russian influence into the 2016 presidential election. While these other disputes are important in their own right, the government&#x26;rsquo;s arguments in other cases shed light on what might be expected, should special counsel Robert Mueller seek information the administration doesn&#x26;rsquo;t want to turn over or, as could happen with Steve Bannon, if a chamber of Congress votes to hold someone in contempt in response to a refusal to answer questions or provide documents.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"491\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/16/0/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-18822-1518759993-1.jpg?resize=720:491\" width=\"720\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x201C;I will figure out how I want to proceed with this, but this is not a good way to go about this.&#x201D;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n</media:group>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>A Federal Appeals Court Ruled That Trump&#x27;s Third Travel Ban Is Likely Unconstitutional</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/zoetillman/a-federal-appeals-court-ruled-that-trumps-third-travel-ban?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-02/15/10/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/sub-buzz-19554-1518709896-8.jpg?resize=720:480\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Leah Millis / Reuters</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>A federal appeals court on Thursday ruled that President Donald Trump&#39;s third attempt at a travel ban is likely unconstitutional, writing that it \"continues to exhibit a primarily religious anti-Muslim objective.\"</p><p>The US Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit upheld a lower court injunction that blocked the Trump administration from enforcing key parts of the travel ban, but put its order on hold while the US Supreme Court takes up the issue of the ban.</p><p>The president&#39;s third travel ban is already before the Supreme Court, after the 9th Circuit <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/appeals-court-rules-that-trumps-third-attempt-at-his-travel?utm_term=.ohKdmv2wb1#.pvPMZBrYl2\">ruled</a> in December that it violated federal law.

The Proclamation is thus not only a likely Establishment Clause violation, but also strikes at the basic notion that the government may not act based on &#x26;#39;religious animosity,&#x26;#39;&#x22; Gregory wrote.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The court upheld US District Judge Theodore Chuang&#x26;#39;s preliminary injunction, which blocked enforcement of the proclamation&#x26;#39;s travel restrictions with respect to nationals of Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen who have a &#x22;credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;This is a developing story.

Bill de Blasio, who was reelected mayor last year, was formerly the city&rsquo;s public advocate. The office is widely viewed as a launching pad for politicians with designs on Gracie Mansion, and the public advocate is first in line to succeed the mayor. If elected, James would be the first black woman mayor of New York City.</p><p>Her early missives do appear to be a signal that James is eager to get the wheels turning on a contentious mayoral primary, even if it&#39;s years away. Formidable candidates could include Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr., New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, and possibly even Rep.

Bill de Blasio, who was reelected mayor last year, was formerly the city&#x26;rsquo;s public advocate. The office is widely viewed as a launching pad for politicians with designs on Gracie Mansion, and the public advocate is first in line to succeed the mayor. If elected, James would be the first black woman mayor of New York City.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Her early missives do appear to be a signal that James is eager to get the wheels turning on a contentious mayoral primary, even if it&#x26;#39;s years away. Formidable candidates could include Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr., New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, and possibly even Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Brooklyn Democrat currently serving in Congress.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;In a brief conversation with BuzzFeed News in Washington last September, James said she looked forward the next step in her career, suggesting that while she understood questions surrounding her possible candidacy for mayor, she was not yet prepared to talk openly about it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;It&#x26;rsquo;s not stopping people in New York from needling her, however.

Mckesson announced his intent to leave his position as head of human resources for Baltimore&#39;s public schools to pursue activism full-time last summer. He&rsquo;s launched a podcast with the liberal media group Crooked Media called <i>Pod Save the People</i>. That podcast &mdash; hosted with fellow Campaign Zero organizers Samuel Sinyangwe and Brittany Packnett, as well as Clint Smith III, a PhD candidate at Harvard &mdash; will have its <a href=\"https://www.thelincolndc.com/event/1625861-pod-save-people-live-washington/\">first live show</a> in Washington on Feb. 18.</p><p>A Viking spokesperson said the book project&#39;s auction was \"highly competitive,\" confirming to BuzzFeed News it had 17 bidders. The book&rsquo;s North American rights were acquired by Georgia Bodnar, a rising publishing industry star, and Wendy Wolf, who recently acquired work from the author of the No. 1 New York Times best-seller <i>Hidden Figures</i>.

Mckesson announced his intent to leave his position as head of human resources for Baltimore&#x26;#39;s public schools to pursue activism full-time last summer. He&#x26;rsquo;s launched a podcast with the liberal media group Crooked Media called &#x3C;i&#x3E;Pod Save the People&#x3C;/i&#x3E;. That podcast &#x26;mdash; hosted with fellow Campaign Zero organizers Samuel Sinyangwe and Brittany Packnett, as well as Clint Smith III, a PhD candidate at Harvard &#x26;mdash; will have its &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.thelincolndc.com/event/1625861-pod-save-people-live-washington/&#x22;&#x3E;first live show&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in Washington on Feb. 18.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;A Viking spokesperson said the book project&#x26;#39;s auction was &#x22;highly competitive,&#x22; confirming to BuzzFeed News it had 17 bidders. The book&#x26;rsquo;s North American rights were acquired by Georgia Bodnar, a rising publishing industry star, and Wendy Wolf, who recently acquired work from the author of the No. 1 New York Times best-seller &#x3C;i&#x3E;Hidden Figures&#x3C;/i&#x3E;. Bodnar and Wolf acquired the rights from CAA, the publisher said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Mckesson will discuss meetings with figures like President Obama, Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton.

The figure marks a significant uptick since 2016, when only three top-tier House candidates, designated \"Red to Blue\" candidates by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, made similar pledges, officials said.<br /></p><p>\"This is a national trend that we&#39;re seeing,\" said Muller, the group&#39;s president. \"The reason that they&#39;re all doing this and campaigning on the issue is they see how much voters feel shut out of the system &mdash; like their voice is drowned out.\"<br /></p><p>In 2016, End Citizens United did not endorse Hillary Clinton until after the Democratic primary. Speaking by phone, Muller praised Clinton for her <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/campaign-finance-reform/\">platform</a> on campaign finance as the \"most progressive plan on the issue that we&#39;d ever seen\" &mdash; with goals to overturn the Citizens United decision, increase disclosure laws, and create a federal system to match small-dollar donations in presidential and congressional elections. Still, Clinton&#39;s campaign accepted thousands of dollars from corporate PACs.</p><p>For Gillibrand, the pledge comes as the latest in a series of aggressive and progressive stands since Trump took office. The Albany-born Democrat came to Washington in 2007 as a representative from New York&#39;s rural 20th District, with a moderate bent and a high rating from the National Rifle Association. A decade later, the 51-year-old claims one of the most liberal records in the US Senate: She cosponsored this year&#39;s single-payer health care plan, voted against most of President Trump&#39;s cabinet nominees, and set off calls for the resignation of Sen. Al Franken, her Democratic colleague, after multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct.</p><p>\"People tend to focus on the political reasons behind why this makes sense,\" Muller said of Gillibrand&#39;s pledge. \"One of the key reasons Sen. Gillibrand did this is it&#39;s just the right thing to do.\" (Muller noted that Gillibrand has long shown interest in issues of transparency: She was the first member of Congress, for instance, to publish a list of her official meetings, earmark requests, and personal financial disclosures.)</p><p>The End Citizens United pledge will apply to Gillibrand&#39;s Senate campaign and her PAC, Off the Sidelines.<br /></p><p>Glen Caplin, an aide, said the senator has already turned down checks this year. He estimated that as a result of the pledge, Gillibrand&#39;s campaign could have raised an additional $800,000 to $1 million in donations from corporate PACs in 2018.</p><p>Still, Caplin said, much of Gillibrand&#39;s fundraising is focused online.</p><p>At the end of last year, the average contribution to her Senate campaign was $48.34.

Bob Menendez after a lengthy corruption case against him ended in mistrial.</p><p>Menendez is a free man, but is still facing a renewed Senate Ethics Committee investigation and is somewhat at odds with more left-leaning Democrats. It&rsquo;s the kind of situation that could lead to a contentious primary with a number of challengers, especially with an energized grassroots base motivated to run for office in the age of Trump.</p><p>But Menendez has drawn just one primary challenger: activist and pundit Michael Starr Hopkins.</p><p>Hopkins said the speed with which the New Jersey Democratic establishment endorsed the senator following the mistrial drove him to challenge the senator&rsquo;s reelection bid &mdash; as well as Menendez&rsquo;s post-mistrial statement. (&ldquo;To those who were digging my political grave so they could jump into my seat, I know who you are and I won&rsquo;t forget you,&rdquo; Menendez said in front of the federal courthouse.)</p><p>Menendez had faced legal scrutiny over his relationship with a major donor, a Florida ophthalmologist. During the trial, former US senator Robert Torricelli (who faced his own scrutiny over a donor) worked behind the scenes to position himself as the successor of Menendez&rsquo;s seat if he was forced to resign from office. But little momentum for a challenge &mdash; primarily against New Jersey&#39;s Democratic machine &mdash; has materialized.</p><p>John Wisniewski, a former progressive candidate for governor and NJ assemblyman, said there&rsquo;s a slim chance of success for anyone looking to challenge Menendez, who&rsquo;s already shored up support from Democratic power players including current governor Phil Murphy and popular New Jersey junior senator Cory Booker. The senator also has a hefty amount of cash ($4.1 million) on hand ahead of the April filing deadline.</p><p>&ldquo;Fundraising is going to be tough. We&rsquo;re not going to go dollar for dollar with Menendez,&rdquo; said Hopkins, whose campaign has raised $26,268 according to Federal Election Commission data, but he hopes that New Jerseyans will connect with someone running for office &ldquo;who isn&rsquo;t a party insider.&rdquo;</p><p>Despite the quick lineup behind Menendez, a poll, conducted by the Rutgers-Eagleton Poll, found that 51% of New Jersey voters thought that Menendez didn&rsquo;t deserve reelection and 49% thought that he should resign. The <a href=\"http://eagletonpoll.rutgers.edu/menendez-booker-nov2017/\">poll</a> surveyed 600 New Jersey adults after the mistrial was declared last November.</p><p>The poll also found that New Jerseyans who were informed about the senator&rsquo;s corruption trial first were more likely to say he didn&rsquo;t deserve reelection, and Hopkins doesn&rsquo;t shy away from mentioning the corruption charges.

Bob Menendez after a lengthy corruption case against him ended in mistrial.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Menendez is a free man, but is still facing a renewed Senate Ethics Committee investigation and is somewhat at odds with more left-leaning Democrats. It&#x26;rsquo;s the kind of situation that could lead to a contentious primary with a number of challengers, especially with an energized grassroots base motivated to run for office in the age of Trump.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But Menendez has drawn just one primary challenger: activist and pundit Michael Starr Hopkins.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hopkins said the speed with which the New Jersey Democratic establishment endorsed the senator following the mistrial drove him to challenge the senator&#x26;rsquo;s reelection bid &#x26;mdash; as well as Menendez&#x26;rsquo;s post-mistrial statement. (&#x26;ldquo;To those who were digging my political grave so they could jump into my seat, I know who you are and I won&#x26;rsquo;t forget you,&#x26;rdquo; Menendez said in front of the federal courthouse.)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Menendez had faced legal scrutiny over his relationship with a major donor, a Florida ophthalmologist. During the trial, former US senator Robert Torricelli (who faced his own scrutiny over a donor) worked behind the scenes to position himself as the successor of Menendez&#x26;rsquo;s seat if he was forced to resign from office. But little momentum for a challenge &#x26;mdash; primarily against New Jersey&#x26;#39;s Democratic machine &#x26;mdash; has materialized.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;John Wisniewski, a former progressive candidate for governor and NJ assemblyman, said there&#x26;rsquo;s a slim chance of success for anyone looking to challenge Menendez, who&#x26;rsquo;s already shored up support from Democratic power players including current governor Phil Murphy and popular New Jersey junior senator Cory Booker. The senator also has a hefty amount of cash ($4.1 million) on hand ahead of the April filing deadline.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;Fundraising is going to be tough. We&#x26;rsquo;re not going to go dollar for dollar with Menendez,&#x26;rdquo; said Hopkins, whose campaign has raised $26,268 according to Federal Election Commission data, but he hopes that New Jerseyans will connect with someone running for office &#x26;ldquo;who isn&#x26;rsquo;t a party insider.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Despite the quick lineup behind Menendez, a poll, conducted by the Rutgers-Eagleton Poll, found that 51% of New Jersey voters thought that Menendez didn&#x26;rsquo;t deserve reelection and 49% thought that he should resign. The &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://eagletonpoll.rutgers.edu/menendez-booker-nov2017/&#x22;&#x3E;poll&#x3C;/a&#x3E; surveyed 600 New Jersey adults after the mistrial was declared last November.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The poll also found that New Jerseyans who were informed about the senator&#x26;rsquo;s corruption trial first were more likely to say he didn&#x26;rsquo;t deserve reelection, and Hopkins doesn&#x26;rsquo;t shy away from mentioning the corruption charges. Hopkins says that he&#x26;rsquo;s running partly because he wants to protect the Senate seat for Democrats. &#x26;ldquo;Losing this one seat, this one vote&#x26;rdquo; could have a major impact on policies (like health care) that protect lots of Americans, Hopkins said.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;He&#x26;rsquo;s also running on the heels of Murphy&#x26;rsquo;s 2017 campaign, in which he ran on a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/incoming-nj-governor-plans-a-swing-to-the-left--and-a-model-for-the-country/2018/01/13/25f06238-f7d7-11e7-a9e3-ab18ce41436a_story.html?utm_term=.50af7cf5033b&#x22;&#x3E;litany of liberal goals&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, from a $15 minimum wage to legalized marijuana.

That helps explain his rising status in a Trump White House dominated by loud conflict. DeStefano outlasted the Republican National Committee veterans who brought him into the fold, and survived <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/28/tillerson-blows-up-at-white-house-aide-240075\">a feud with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson</a>.

Under the memorandum, the defense secretary is supposed to submit an implementation plan for the three portions of the memo &#x26;mdash; recruitment rules, retention, and health care &#x26;mdash; to Trump by Feb. 21.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;All three of those provisions have been put on hold by various federal courts &#x26;mdash; including by &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/dominicholden/a-federal-judge-just-called-trumps-transgender-military?utm_term=.kf7Gb1O6z#.nwOLgw1WA&#x22;&#x3E;Garbis&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in a challenge backed by the ACLU &#x26;mdash; and the administration &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/has-the-trump-administration-stopped-fighting-the-jan-1?utm_term=.xt8B3wWgJ#.pwM4pNYM1&#x22;&#x3E;stopped fighting&#x3C;/a&#x3E; a Jan. 1 deadline for accepting new military recruits who are transgender days before the deadline went into effect.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;This week, Justice Department lawyers argued in one of those challenges that the defendants could not comply with obligations to turn over the required information &#x22;because they will not be defending the policy now at issue but will be defending the policy to be disclosed on February 21, 2018,&#x22; Garbis wrote in a Tuesday order, summarizing what the Justice Department&#x26;#39;s lawyers had said in a telephone conference from earlier in the day. A lawyer for the challengers who was on the call confirmed the accuracy of the judge&#x26;#39;s account.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Asked about the statement that a new &#x22;policy&#x22; would be &#x22;disclosed on February 21, 2018,&#x22; Maj. David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesperson, said that the Pentagon only would be preparing &#x22;recommendations,&#x22; but that a final decision on the &#x22;new policy&#x22; would come from the White House.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;The panel that was established by the Secretary of Defense is presenting their recommendations to him. At the end of this month, The Secretary will make his recommendations to the President, who will then make a decision and establish the new policy on transgender [service] in the military,&#x22; Eastburn told BuzzFeed News.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Regarding its defense of that policy, noted by Garbis, Justice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec told BuzzFeed News, &#x22;We will continue to defend the President&#x26;#39;s and Secretary of Defense&#x26;rsquo;s lawful authority in district court.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Under Garbis&#x26;#39;s order, the Justice Department is to fulfill their evidentiary obligations in the case &#x22;shortly after February 21, 2018.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The White House did not respond to a request for comment, and the Defense and Justice departments did not provide any additional clarification on the plans or timeline for making them public.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"530\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/7/16/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/sub-buzz-12911-1518039102-14.jpg?resize=720:530\" width=\"720\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n</media:group>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>Democrats Are Starting To Worry About The Georgia Governor&#x2019;s Primary</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/darrensands/democrats-are-starting-to-worry-about-the-georgia-governors?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-02/6/20/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/sub-buzz-15926-1517968215-1.jpg?resize=720:480\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>Stacey Abrams speaks at the 2016 DNC.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Alex Wong / Getty Images</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Democrats have begun to worry that a contentious and expensive primary in Georgia&rsquo;s governor&rsquo;s race could majorly disadvantage the eventual nominee &mdash; in a race that some believe is winnable amid President Trump&rsquo;s unpopularity.<br /></p><p>Three months remain until Georgia&rsquo;s May 22 primary and Georgia Democrats have two choices in the race for governor: Stacey Evans, a lawyer and former state legislator who hails from the northern part of the state, and Stacey Abrams, a tax attorney and former House minority leader of the Georgia state legislature.</p><p>Abrams advisers told BuzzFeed News worry that if the primary runs its full course, it will get harder for the campaign to go into a potential general election at full strength. That&rsquo;s in part because of a big gamble by Abrams: running an expensive, aggressive field campaign almost from the very start. The campaign so far has spent nearly everything it&rsquo;s taken in, but national Democrats say they understand the necessity. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s doing a November field campaign in January because she&rsquo;s a black woman,&rdquo; a campaign adviser told BuzzFeed News.</p><p>That&rsquo;s required a lot of fundraising, as well, including in places like Washington where Abrams is a well-known figure, after years of organizing voting rights and registration efforts. Abrams, for instance, recently drew a large audience at a fundraiser at The Park at 14th, a four-level nightclub frequented by a young political class. Servers held out plates of jerk wings and macaroni and cheese, and music blared before a slate of speakers addressed the crowd, including a very young white woman. The idea of Abrams becoming the nation&rsquo;s first black female governor has been the driving force and primary currency of her campaign. (The campaign is expected to announce about $1.7 million in donations during the last period, from about 14,800 donors &mdash; which would make the average donation a little over $100.)</p><p>Her argument is that any Democrat not working as hard as she is to expand the voter base is going to continue to lose elections, citing successful efforts in <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexislevinson/jones-senate?utm_term=.yalAAxv6E#.bpmYYOa0w\">Alabama</a> and <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/ralph-northam-wins-democratic-primary-for-virginia-governor?utm_term=.agk99kNKg#.ug944V58N\">Virginia</a> as examples. &ldquo;When you start a company or when you begin any type of project, your responsibility is to cultivate customers,&rdquo; she said, invoking her business background.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You do not reach customers by raising money and holding it and hoping your customers come to ask how much money you have,&rdquo; she told BuzzFeed News. &ldquo;Any startup that went out for seed capital to put it in the bank and hold it just &rsquo;cause would not find new investors. They would not find traction because they would not find customers, which in this case are voters who have not been targets of campaigns.&rdquo;</p><p>Meanwhile, there was a rumor circulating in recent weeks that Stacey Evans might drop out of the gubernatorial primary and run for attorney general or lieutenant governor instead. She&rsquo;s not getting out, though.</p><p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; in the words of an Evans adviser to BuzzFeed News, &ldquo;is a lie.&rdquo;</p><p>Her campaign has shown a willingness to take chances. In Atlanta&rsquo;s tumultuous mayoral runoff election, Evans endorsed Keisha Lance Bottoms over Mary Norwood, a white independent candidate who had an overwhelming majority of the white vote and who was backed by a black city council president and former mayor Shirley Franklin. The risk paid off. Bottoms declared victory when ahead by a slight margin on election night, and Norwood conceded the election two weeks later. (A Democratic source said Bottoms was heard speaking about Evans in glowing terms at the US Conference of Mayors&rsquo; 86th Winter Meeting last month.)</p><p>But it hasn&rsquo;t been without controversy. Last month, the Evans campaign filmed a digital ad inside Ebenezer Baptist Church depicting Evans as a welcome guest. The campaign was swiftly rebuked by the church, which asked the campaign to remove the ad from its social media, but it had already gone viral. Through the pastor, the Rev. Raphael G. Warnock, the church released a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/darrensands/status/956950898281938945\">statement</a>: &ldquo;Our church leadership and administration does not condone such use of the church&#39;s iconography or worship space.&rdquo; The political commentator Jason Johnson called the apparent effort to superimpose Evans&rsquo; face on Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s at the end of the video &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.theroot.com/white-candidate-for-georgia-governor-basically-does-mlk-1822414210\">political blackface</a>.&rdquo; Since then, she rolled out, formally, the endorsement of a well-known district attorney who is a black woman.</p><p>In the background of all of this, the top Republican challenger, Lt.

John Delaney, the first Democrat to announce a presidential bid against Donald Trump, is now running two TV ads in the early-voting state of Iowa.</p><p>Delaney, a three-term congressman and former financial services executive, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/the-first-democrat-talking-about-a-presidential-bid-is-a?utm_term=.ymLg07Dpgk#.eu48xWAv8m\">launched</a> his presidential campaign last July in a Washington Post op-ed, more than a year and a half earlier than candidates typically jump in the race to become their party&#39;s nominee. This weekend, he also became the first candidate to buy airtime.</p><p>The 54-year-old candidate is running two ads for four weeks across Iowa &mdash; part of a $1 million campaign, according to Delaney spokesman Will McDonald.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olJ-FSClBdo\">first ad</a> began Sunday, timed to the Super Bowl, as <a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2018/01/30/john-delaney-air-tv-ads-iowa-2020-presidential-bid/1079332001/\">reported</a> in the Des Moines Register. The second, titled \"Early,\" will begin airing Monday on network and cable in Des Moines and Cedar Rapids, McDonald said. &ldquo;How do we bring our country together?&rdquo; Delaney asks in the ad. &ldquo;How do we begin to heal a fractured nation?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The work starts now.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\t\n\n\t \t  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M26J2Xf5E8w\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\t  \n\t\n\n\n <p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=M26J2Xf5E8w\">youtube.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The ads were made by the firm Siegel Strategies, according to McDonald.<br /></p><p>Both spots pitch Delaney to Iowa voters as a pragmatic, no-gimmicks lawmaker willing to work across the aisle. It&rsquo;s a message seen more often in a general election than a Democratic primary &mdash; a signal that the little-known Delaney will not try to compete with left-leaning candidates for the progressive mantle.

RNC officials downplayed the idea as one of many tossed around Thursday during the Presidential Nominating Process Committee&rsquo;s closed-door session.</p><p>The panel is consulting with the Trump White House on rule changes for 2020 and will issue recommendations in the coming months.

And that&#39;s renewed speculation that he (or another Trump critic, like Sens. Jeff Flake or Ben Sasse) might be eyeing a challenge to the sitting president, something that hasn&rsquo;t seriously happened in decades, and comes with significant hurdles.</p><p>Striking a blow to President Trump&rsquo;s reelection chances almost certainly would require an upset victory or better-than-imagined showing &mdash; think Eugene McCarthy chasing LBJ in 1968 &mdash; in New Hampshire or one of two other key early voting states: Iowa and South Carolina.</p><p>But would-be Trump challengers won&rsquo;t find many friendly GOP leaders there. In interviews this week at the Republican National Committee&rsquo;s winter meetings, top party officials from these states pledged allegiance to Trump and questioned why anyone would bother to try to wrestle the nomination from him.</p><p>&ldquo;If and when that would happen, I have confidence that the South Carolina Republican Party would endorse President Trump,&rdquo; said Drew McKissick, that state&rsquo;s GOP chair.</p><p>New Hampshire GOP Chair Jeanie Forrester at first seemed puzzled when asked if any Republicans had reached out to her about a possible primary bid. &ldquo;Against <i>the president</i>?&rdquo; she replied.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have to really think about that,&rdquo; she said later when asked if the party would endorse in a contested primary. &ldquo;My general thought is that he is the president, and I would support him.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The dynamics are a bit different in Iowa. There the state party officially is expected to remain neutral because it oversees the influential first-in-nation caucuses. But former Rep. Jeff Kaufmann, the state chair, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/06/22/iowa-gop-chairman-rips-arrogant-academic-ben-sasse-215293\">has lit into Sasse</a>. And Steve Scheffler, Iowa&rsquo;s RNC national committee member, is <a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2017/11/03/even-contested-caucus-iowa-gop-all-trump-committee-member-says/830377001/\">on record saying</a> that individual Republican leaders in the state should stand behind Trump.</p><p>&ldquo;You never say never,&rdquo; Scheffler said Thursday when asked about the viability of a primary challenger in Iowa, &ldquo;but I just don&rsquo;t see it happening.&rdquo;</p><p>John Weaver, Kasich&rsquo;s political strategist, told BuzzFeed News in an email that &ldquo;many respected Republicans, independents, and some disaffected Democrats &hellip; including influential opinion leaders in those states with early primaries&rdquo; have urged Kasich to run in 2020. He said Kasich is focused on finishing his second and last term as governor and has made no decision.</p><p>\"No one,&rdquo; Weaver added, &ldquo;decides to run or not run for president based on the views of a few party insiders.&rdquo;</p><p>Kasich&#39;s 2016 campaign and his refusal to support Trump in the general election remain sore spots for the president, and the 2020 rumblings have accelerated the feud. During a private RNC dinner Thursday evening, Trump blasted Kasich and a former Ohio Republican Party chair who had been a Kasich loyalist and Trump critic, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HenryJGomez/status/959279637565030401\">according to sources present</a>.</p><p>The mechanics of a primary challenge are messy, even in the most tempting of circumstances and regardless of whether Kasich is the right candidate. (Others seen as potential Republican rivals include Flake, who will soon retire from the Senate, and Sasse, who has spoken at GOP events in Iowa in recent months.)</p><p>But Trump is unpopular, unpredictable, and untethered to the old-school GOP. He&rsquo;s flirted with enough disaster in his first year to invite not only doubts about the power of his incumbency, but also speculation about impeachment, resignation, or a decision against standing for a second term. No one knows where the Trump presidency will be in two years, let alone two months. Still, with the exception of Kasich&rsquo;s enduring interest in New Hampshire and <a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2017/11/18/dont-trust-politicians-solve-our-problems-u-s-sen-ben-sasse-tells-iowa-crowd/878133001/\">Sasse&rsquo;s speeches</a>, there&rsquo;s no evidence that anyone other than Trump is preparing for a primary.</p><p>Take <a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2018/01/26/iowa-caucuses-back-but-focus-year-state-races/1049276001/\">next week&#39;s off-year caucuses in Iowa</a>. The Trump reelection campaign printed 16-page pamphlets promoting the president and sent them to the Iowa GOP for distribution at caucus sites. An Iowa GOP official told BuzzFeed News that the state party would provide the same service if another presidential contender sent literature, but no one besides Trump has.</p><p>In South Carolina, GOP event organizers have struggled in the past year to book speakers &mdash; many high-profile Republicans don&rsquo;t want to send the wrong signal, McKissick said. An appearance last year by Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado merited <a href=\"https://www.postandcourier.com/news/colorado-sen-cory-gardner-will-headline-south-carolina-gop-s/article_64af0424-928e-11e7-a75c-732fb427d655.html\">this line from the Charleston Post and Courier</a>: &ldquo;South Carolina political party dinners usually attract future presidential hopefuls to gauge their interest in an early primary state.&rdquo; (As McKissick put it to a reporter: &ldquo;<i>You</i> could come down and speak and people would think <i>you</i> were running.&rdquo;)</p><p>Also complicating the path for any Trump challenger: the RNC itself. It&rsquo;s tightly aligned with the White House. And this week&rsquo;s meetings in Washington include another gathering of the Presidential Nominating Process Committee, which is expected to make the 2020 primary a cakewalk for Trump. RNC Co-Chair Bob Paduchik, who developed an adversarial relationship with Kasich while serving as Trump&rsquo;s Ohio campaign director in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/henrygomez/donald-trumps-team-is-in-2020-mode-at-the-rncs-summer?utm_term=.fcnn03pGn#.tejODB7rO\">is steering the process</a>.</p><p>McKissick said no one has sought his advice about a 2020 bid. But if someone did?</p><p>&ldquo;First off, they&rsquo;re on their own,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell them we support the president. &hellip; I speak at county party meetings, Republican women&rsquo;s club meetings, and all around &mdash; once a week, at least &mdash; somewhere around the state. I ain&rsquo;t running into any South Carolina Republicans who are looking to buy anything right now that ain&rsquo;t Donald Trump.&rdquo;</p><p>Kasich, with his book last year lamenting what&rsquo;s become of the Republican Party and a national TV lap this week that included <i>Late Night With Seth Meyers</i> and <i>Morning Joe</i>, is the least shy about his interest. His <a href=\"http://www.concordmonitor.com/John-Kasich-returning-to-New-Hampshire-15130402\">April 3 speech at New England College</a> will be his second visit to New Hampshire in less than a year. Kasich finished second to Trump in the state&#39;s 2016 primary, and it was the high point of his campaign. But when he was asked on <i>Morning Joe</i> if someone would challenge Trump for the nomination, he danced around the question. &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t raise the money and make a good case, you don&rsquo;t run, unless you just want to do it for the heck of it,&rdquo; he replied.</p><p>The governor also has signaled he might be interested in running as an independent: &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; Weaver wondered in his email to BuzzFeed News, &ldquo;does everyone assume the only option is running in a GOP primary?&rdquo;</p><p>Forrester acknowledged that Kasich&rsquo;s moves have drawn attention, but like McKissick, she said Kasich and other potential candidates have not asked her for advice.</p><p>&ldquo;I like to think back to when I first decided to run for office,&rdquo; Forrester said. &ldquo;I had a lot of people telling me to stay out of it. I would never discourage anyone. I would lay out all the hurdles &mdash; can you raise enough money? &mdash; not as discouragement&sbquo; just as the facts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t tell [Kasich] what to do,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;And if I did, it&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;d listen to me.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n\n <p><small></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]]></description>\n<author>Henry J.

And Steve Scheffler, Iowa&#x26;rsquo;s RNC national committee member, is &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2017/11/03/even-contested-caucus-iowa-gop-all-trump-committee-member-says/830377001/&#x22;&#x3E;on record saying&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that individual Republican leaders in the state should stand behind Trump.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;You never say never,&#x26;rdquo; Scheffler said Thursday when asked about the viability of a primary challenger in Iowa, &#x26;ldquo;but I just don&#x26;rsquo;t see it happening.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;John Weaver, Kasich&#x26;rsquo;s political strategist, told BuzzFeed News in an email that &#x26;ldquo;many respected Republicans, independents, and some disaffected Democrats &#x26;hellip; including influential opinion leaders in those states with early primaries&#x26;rdquo; have urged Kasich to run in 2020. He said Kasich is focused on finishing his second and last term as governor and has made no decision.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;No one,&#x26;rdquo; Weaver added, &#x26;ldquo;decides to run or not run for president based on the views of a few party insiders.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Kasich&#x26;#39;s 2016 campaign and his refusal to support Trump in the general election remain sore spots for the president, and the 2020 rumblings have accelerated the feud. During a private RNC dinner Thursday evening, Trump blasted Kasich and a former Ohio Republican Party chair who had been a Kasich loyalist and Trump critic, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/HenryJGomez/status/959279637565030401&#x22;&#x3E;according to sources present&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The mechanics of a primary challenge are messy, even in the most tempting of circumstances and regardless of whether Kasich is the right candidate. (Others seen as potential Republican rivals include Flake, who will soon retire from the Senate, and Sasse, who has spoken at GOP events in Iowa in recent months.)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;But Trump is unpopular, unpredictable, and untethered to the old-school GOP. He&#x26;rsquo;s flirted with enough disaster in his first year to invite not only doubts about the power of his incumbency, but also speculation about impeachment, resignation, or a decision against standing for a second term. No one knows where the Trump presidency will be in two years, let alone two months. Still, with the exception of Kasich&#x26;rsquo;s enduring interest in New Hampshire and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2017/11/18/dont-trust-politicians-solve-our-problems-u-s-sen-ben-sasse-tells-iowa-crowd/878133001/&#x22;&#x3E;Sasse&#x26;rsquo;s speeches&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, there&#x26;rsquo;s no evidence that anyone other than Trump is preparing for a primary.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Take &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2018/01/26/iowa-caucuses-back-but-focus-year-state-races/1049276001/&#x22;&#x3E;next week&#x26;#39;s off-year caucuses in Iowa&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. The Trump reelection campaign printed 16-page pamphlets promoting the president and sent them to the Iowa GOP for distribution at caucus sites. An Iowa GOP official told BuzzFeed News that the state party would provide the same service if another presidential contender sent literature, but no one besides Trump has.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;In South Carolina, GOP event organizers have struggled in the past year to book speakers &#x26;mdash; many high-profile Republicans don&#x26;rsquo;t want to send the wrong signal, McKissick said. An appearance last year by Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado merited &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.postandcourier.com/news/colorado-sen-cory-gardner-will-headline-south-carolina-gop-s/article_64af0424-928e-11e7-a75c-732fb427d655.html&#x22;&#x3E;this line from the Charleston Post and Courier&#x3C;/a&#x3E;: &#x26;ldquo;South Carolina political party dinners usually attract future presidential hopefuls to gauge their interest in an early primary state.&#x26;rdquo; (As McKissick put it to a reporter: &#x26;ldquo;&#x3C;i&#x3E;You&#x3C;/i&#x3E; could come down and speak and people would think &#x3C;i&#x3E;you&#x3C;/i&#x3E; were running.&#x26;rdquo;)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Also complicating the path for any Trump challenger: the RNC itself. It&#x26;rsquo;s tightly aligned with the White House. And this week&#x26;rsquo;s meetings in Washington include another gathering of the Presidential Nominating Process Committee, which is expected to make the 2020 primary a cakewalk for Trump. RNC Co-Chair Bob Paduchik, who developed an adversarial relationship with Kasich while serving as Trump&#x26;rsquo;s Ohio campaign director in 2016, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/henrygomez/donald-trumps-team-is-in-2020-mode-at-the-rncs-summer?utm_term=.fcnn03pGn#.tejODB7rO&#x22;&#x3E;is steering the process&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;McKissick said no one has sought his advice about a 2020 bid. But if someone did?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;First off, they&#x26;rsquo;re on their own,&#x26;rdquo; he said. &#x26;ldquo;I&#x26;rsquo;m going to tell them we support the president. &#x26;hellip; I speak at county party meetings, Republican women&#x26;rsquo;s club meetings, and all around &#x26;mdash; once a week, at least &#x26;mdash; somewhere around the state. I ain&#x26;rsquo;t running into any South Carolina Republicans who are looking to buy anything right now that ain&#x26;rsquo;t Donald Trump.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Kasich, with his book last year lamenting what&#x26;rsquo;s become of the Republican Party and a national TV lap this week that included &#x3C;i&#x3E;Late Night With Seth Meyers&#x3C;/i&#x3E; and &#x3C;i&#x3E;Morning Joe&#x3C;/i&#x3E;, is the least shy about his interest. His &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.concordmonitor.com/John-Kasich-returning-to-New-Hampshire-15130402&#x22;&#x3E;April 3 speech at New England College&#x3C;/a&#x3E; will be his second visit to New Hampshire in less than a year. Kasich finished second to Trump in the state&#x26;#39;s 2016 primary, and it was the high point of his campaign. But when he was asked on &#x3C;i&#x3E;Morning Joe&#x3C;/i&#x3E; if someone would challenge Trump for the nomination, he danced around the question. &#x26;ldquo;If you can&#x26;rsquo;t raise the money and make a good case, you don&#x26;rsquo;t run, unless you just want to do it for the heck of it,&#x26;rdquo; he replied.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The governor also has signaled he might be interested in running as an independent: &#x26;ldquo;Why,&#x26;rdquo; Weaver wondered in his email to BuzzFeed News, &#x26;ldquo;does everyone assume the only option is running in a GOP primary?&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Forrester acknowledged that Kasich&#x26;rsquo;s moves have drawn attention, but like McKissick, she said Kasich and other potential candidates have not asked her for advice.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;I like to think back to when I first decided to run for office,&#x26;rdquo; Forrester said. &#x26;ldquo;I had a lot of people telling me to stay out of it. I would never discourage anyone. I would lay out all the hurdles &#x26;mdash; can you raise enough money? &#x26;mdash; not as discouragement&#x26;sbquo; just as the facts.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x26;ldquo;I couldn&#x26;rsquo;t tell [Kasich] what to do,&#x26;rdquo; she added. &#x26;ldquo;And if I did, it&#x26;rsquo;s not like he&#x26;rsquo;d listen to me.&#x26;rdquo;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;br /&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;small&#x3E;&#x3C;/small&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;\n\n\n\n\n</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"518\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/1/13/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/sub-buzz-28177-1517508071-2.jpg?resize=720:518\" width=\"720\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Then&#x2013;presidential candidates Donald Trump and John Kasich at a Republican debate in 2016.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n</media:group>\n</item>\n</channel>\n</rss>",
