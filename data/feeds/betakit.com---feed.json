Have a question you would like answered? Tweet them with the #askadeveloper hashtag, or email them <a href=\"mailto:contact@tribalscale.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<hr width=\"20%\" />\n<p><em>By: Andrea Barros and Ainan Ameen</em></p>\n<p>When designers and developers work together, they create magic. Pair the stereotypical left-brained, logical-thinking engineer with the right-brained, creative designer, and the ensuing collaboration will produce an exceptional synergy that is geared to solving and creating unique digital products. </p>\n<p>Designers and developers each bring different skills and perspectives to a project, but they do share the same goals. When the two collaborate, they can harness each others talents and methods to build digital products that are intuitive, functional, and seamless. So, instead of talking past each other, let\u2019s come together.</p>\n<p>First, what do designers and developers <em>do</em>, respectively? </p>\n<p>The UX (User Experience) designer enhances user experience and interaction by improving the usability of a product through research. The UX work process is highly empathetic and may involve user-testing to best understand human behaviour and needs. The UI (User Interface) designer is primarily concerned with the emotional integrity of the product. The UI designer crafts the front-end look and feel of a product to ensure UX research is reflected and designed with consideration. Although, the distinctions between the two are often blurry and roles and responsibilities may be combined into one. In the end the UX/UI designer produces the wireframes, storyboards, and product mockups.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Marriage between designer creativity and the developer\u2019s toolbox will lead to beautiful, strong product. Start from the beginning, communicate empathetically, leave your ego at the door.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The developer focuses on <em>building</em>, bringing the digital product to life. It is the developer\u2019s responsibility to match the build with the intended features, and in the most appropriate way. The developer assesses project feasibility and timelines, writes, implements, and tests code, and then releases the product. At TribalScale, the developers practice an accelerated form of agile development: extreme programming. Extreme programming involves pair programming (two developer working on the same code), ongoing feedback, and rapid iterations. The process is collaborative and helps us build products that are validated and tested. </p>\n<p>Designers and developers work closely with each other. Without a designer, the developer has no guidance to the product\u2019s user flow, functionality, and user experience. Without the developer the designer\u2019s envisioned product won\u2019t come to fruition. </p>\n<h3>How to work together</h3>\n<p>In any project, the designer first conducts user research and delves into the space to understand user needs and the product journey. During the UX research phase, the designer validates how to best create an awesome product that actually fills the need of the target users. The aim is to first create a wireframe that showcases the product\u2019s functionality, and then a high-fidelity design that will give the product some emotional life and breath. Through this stage, the designer will work with an engineer to review functionality and technical limitations.</p>\n<p>Then, the designer will independently create the wireframes that capture business and user logic, and will review the wireframes with the engineer for technical validation. Lastly, polishing designs and adding animations in the hi-fi stage, which brings out the brand and adds character, polish, and delight. </p>\n<p>At TribalScale, both devs and design collaboratively work with design mockups. They ease communication by exporting them into a platform that eases collaboration (such as Zeplin or Sympli), where developers can measure all visual blocks, text sizes, and other design specifications for build. Designs are also uploaded and linked into an app (such as InVision or Marvel) for functionality assessments, and easier visualization (i.e., you can see what would happen if you click a button). At this stage, developers have the chance to measure technical feasibility and see whether the design falls within the project\u2019s scope, and provide the designer with feedback.  </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rawpixel-com-2966121-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"teamwork\" width=\"690\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-129909\" srcset=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rawpixel-com-2966121-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rawpixel-com-2966121-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rawpixel-com-2966121-768x513.jpg 768w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rawpixel-com-2966121-600x401.jpg 600w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rawpixel-com-2966121-296x197.jpg 296w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rawpixel-com-2966121-1050x700.jpg 1050w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rawpixel-com-2966121-869x580.jpg 869w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rawpixel-com-2966121.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" /></p>\n<p>Once all mockups, prototypes, and design builds are finalized, the developer codes and works somewhat independently. However, the designer\u2019s vision and ideas are always at the fore of the building process. </p>\n<p>At TribalScale, we practice a unique form of Quality Assurance (QA), which directly reflects the rest of our principles \u2014 pair programming, feedback, and quick iteration. Rather than conducting design QA in the release candidate stage, and risk deprioritizing important pixel-based stories, we try to do design QA early and regularly. To do design QA, we suggest scheduling a separate designer-developer meeting to go through each feature. A one-on-one, face-to-face session is the most effective way to identify specific fixes and make the product pixel-perfect. It is so much easier to pinpoint issues while working on the product, and communication is streamlined as there are no notes passed back and forth. </p>\n<p>It is also more efficient. Imagine the designer and developer pairing: one computer, two great minds, mutually revising and reviewing the same product. They can make the quick fixes together while the engineer focuses on the code and the designer focuses on the pixels and visuals. Together, issues can be caught and resolved early. It is also much easier to conduct QA when seeing the product on device, getting a sense of how it breathes and lives. Such interactive, collaborative QA will help the team build the best product, even if it already aligned with the mock-ups. The design QA process we practice at TribalScale is very iterative and ensures we ship a product we are proud of from both build and design perspectives. </p>\n<p>Perhaps inevitably, the designer and developer may conflict over product ideas and priorities. </p>\n<h3> How to <em>best</em> work together </h3>\n<h5> 1. Communication</h5>\n<p>Open lines of communication are key. Designers tend to be imaginative and creative, coming up with unique, and maybe ambitious, product features. It\u2019s possible that these features are unrealistic or even infeasible; communicating project direction and aims from the get-go will limit any unforeseen design needs or limitations down the road. Together and from the start, designers and developers should discuss approaches, features, and accurately scope the project to make sure they are on the same page and that the project meets user needs.</p>\n<h5>2. Time for feedback</h5>\n<p>Close collaboration provides both developers and designers with the chance to give feedback throughout the project. Since each may come in with a separate set of ideas on what\u2019s right or logical based on their previous experiences and existing knowledge, it\u2019s best to communicate ideas, challenge each other, and build on each others skill-sets for the best possible version of the project. In the QA stage, feedback is most important. Pairing through design QA provides both with the chance to review each feature set, and in detail from both design and development perspectives. Fixes can be made frequently and quickly, and then the team can move onto the next iteration of the project. </p>\n<h5>3. Leave egos at the door</h5>\n<p>For an optimal user experience, designers and developers need to leave egos at the door and give their team members the benefit of doubt. Keep in mind that someone else may have an alternative idea or experience-based suggestion that will deliver an improved product. Instead of making assumptions, listen to each other&#8217;s ideas. Designers: developers know the platform best; trust that their toolbox will help you figure out what is possible for the project scope. Developers: designers have spent ample time researching the user, they are empathetic, and are trained in usability and visual interfaces.</p>\n<h5>4. The earlier the better</h5>\n<p>To best combine the designer&#8217;s imagination with the developer\u2019s toolbox, working together early on is the surefire way to create the best version of your product. Involve each other, listen and understand one another. Both the designer and developer are essential for a user-friendly, intuitive, top-tier product. So, from the beginning be open and communicate to limit misunderstandings and avoid blocks, and most importantly, to support each other. </p>\n<h3>The benefits of collaboration</h3>\n<p>Designers and developers ship better products when they work together, and isn\u2019t this the shared goal? </p>\n<p>Bringing both aspects of the team together will ensure that a functional product with a supreme UI and UX is built. Issues will be caught early and frequently with a paired design QA, and design issues won\u2019t be deprioritized if there is a sudden crash. Plus, you won\u2019t need overly robust teams: one designer and a pair of engineers will suffice!</p>\n<p>In the end, designers are trained to think creatively and work outside of the box while developers are taught to apply their tools with precision and logic. Yet, for a great product in terms of both code quality and UX/UI, you need collaboration and communication. Marriage between designer creativity and the developer\u2019s toolbox will lead to beautiful, strong product. So start from the beginning, communicate empathetically, leave your ego at the door, and prioritize feedback.</p>\n<hr width=\"20%\" />\n<p><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-59125 size-thumbnail\" style=\"border-radius: 50%;\" src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-16-at-1.00.23-PM.png\" alt=\"Andrea Barros\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></p>\n<p>Andrea Barros is the Lead UX/UI Designer at TribalScale.

The CSE says that, unlike blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, the STOs will be subject to full regulation by applicable securities commissions. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a landmark announcement for the Canadian capital markets. The Canadian Securities Exchange expects to be the first recognized exchange in Canada to introduce a fully developed blockchain platform for trading, clearing and settling tokenized securities,\u201d said Richard Carleton, CEO of the CSE.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur platform represents an intersection between blockchain and the capital markets that delivers on blockchain\u2019s promise to disrupt conventional transaction and record-keeping mechanisms, thereby providing tangible benefits for market stakeholders. By harnessing this technology, the potential exists to extend corporate finance beyond the limits of traditional equity and debt offerings. We look forward to working with regulators and with corporations seeking to raise capital through STOs to fully realize the benefits of the new platform. We believe it represents a tremendous opportunity for stakeholders in the Canadian marketplace.\u201d</p>\n<p>The company hopes that the benefits of the new platform will include reduction of risk for investment dealers and their clients by ensuring that trades clear and settle immediately, compared to the current system used for equities which requires two full business days; eliminating the need for investment dealers to post initial and mark-to-market capital with a clearing house pending the settlement of trades; facilitation of shareholder communications; significant oversight of STOs compared to unregulated Initial Coin Offerings; and broadened participation in tokenized security markets by providing access to new categories investors.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As part of the announcement, the CSE has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d) with Vancouver-based Kabuni Technologies, a blockchain platform for 3D printing. Kabuni intends to file a prospectus with the British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC) for approval to issue tokens to investors through a security token offering. The CSE licensed the necessary technology for the clearing house from New York-based Fundamental Interactions, whic has experience delivering blockchain-enabled solutions to clients in the United States and Asia.</p>\n<p><em>Photo via <a href=\"https://www.bitsonline.com/canadian-securities-exchange-blockchain/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bitsonline</a></em></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/canadian-securities-exchange-building-blockchain-based-platform-for-securities-clearing-and-settlement/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>AI pioneer Richard Sutton a keynote speaker at AccelerateAB</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/ai-pioneer-richard-sutton-a-keynote-speaker-at-accelerateab/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/ai-pioneer-richard-sutton-a-keynote-speaker-at-accelerateab/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 19:45:49 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[edmonton]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[events]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=129867</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Edmonton&#8217;s AccelerateAB announced that AI pioneer Richard Sutton will be its closing keynote speaker.

The expansion to Quebec is NEXT Canada&#8217;s first physical presence outside Ontario.</p>\n<p>&#8220;NEXT Canada is a critical partner in the SCALE.AI supercluster initiative,&#8221; said H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Desmarais, CEO of CEIM and co-chair of SCALE.AI. &#8220;They have a terrific model and a proven track record of supporting high potential entrepreneurs. The NextAI accelerator program is a shining example of how to connect talent to the marketplace, increasing the adoption of built-in-Canada technology.&#8221;</p>\n<p>NEXT Canada is exploring opportunities to expand westward to other hubs of AI activity, including Edmonton, Alberta and other potential locations. NEXT Canada is already collaborating with groups in all three provinces, including the Institute for Data Valorization (IVADO), the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) in Quebec, the Vector Institute in Ontario, and the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii). </p>\n<p>NEXT Canada will announce the timing and other details of its NextAI &#8211; Montreal program in the coming weeks. </p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/today-in-ai-toronto-based-deeplearni-ng-joins-vector-institute-nextai-expands-program-to-montreal/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Ask an Investor: Should I prioritize pitching US investors over Canadians?</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/ask-an-investor-should-i-prioritize-pitching-us-investors-over-canadians/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/ask-an-investor-should-i-prioritize-pitching-us-investors-over-canadians/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 13:00:11 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Sarah Marion]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[ask an investor]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Resource]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[vc]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=129775</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Welcome to a BetaKit weekly series designed to help startups and entrepreneurs.

Each week, investors tackle the tough questions facing founders today. Have a question you would like answered? Tweet them with the #askaninvestor hashtag, or email them <a href=\"mailto:askaninvestor@betakit.com\" target=\"_top\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<hr width=\"20%\" />\n<p>When Christian discussed <a href=\"https://betakit.com/ask-an-investor-how-do-i-connect-with-vcs/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">building a list of your target investors</a> a few weeks ago, his comments around geography were limited to considering locality (with the assumption that you might want someone nearby). And yet, ask anyone in the Canadian tech ecosystem for their thoughts on Canadian versus US investors (or search StartupNorth), and you\u2019re likely setting yourself up for a heated conversation.</p>\n<p>This conversation is increasingly topical as <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-14/canadian-tech-is-having-a-moment-the-trick-is-not-to-mess-it-up\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Canada\u2019s stock is rising</a>. Toronto is <a href=\"https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/torontoglobal/TorontoRegionResponsetoAmazonHQ2RFP_PD.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">bragging via Amazon RFP</a>, industry heavyweights (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Uber) are building Canadian AI research teams, <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/tech-news/university-toronto-creative-destruction-lab-startup/article34338420/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">accelerators are courting US VCs</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-08/trudeau-meets-bezos-in-san-francisco-with-mixed-record-on-tech\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Trudeau is championing Canadian tech innovation</a>. As Canadian startups finally get their due, those startup founders have more capital options than ever and this question of investor HQ comes up again and again.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our Canadian companies have outperformed their US competitors, and as Canadian VCs, we can do the same.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As a Canadian VC, I\u2019m happy to see US VCs actively investing north of the border. Sure, it makes my job harder, but ultimately we\u2019ve always considered US VCs our dominant competitor. More capital (that comes without a requirement to move the company down south) helps the ecosystem grow, encourages later-stage companies which spin-off talent which creates and joins other startups, ultimately creating the density we need to flourish as a community. </p>\n<p>And competition among VCs is a good thing for startups. It increases the chances that one investor sees something worth investing in that others may have missed, it (ideally) results in fair pricing and clean term sheets, and it makes sure that as investors we\u2019re constantly upping the bar on the value we\u2019re providing in the ecosystem. Our Canadian companies have outperformed their US competitors, and as Canadian VCs, we can do the same.</p>\n<p>The location of your investors is one factor among many to consider when raising funds, and the emphasis you place on geography will differ depending on the role this VC is taking. If they\u2019re a lead investor, the respective strengths highlighted above warrant more consideration than when you\u2019re examining an investor who\u2019ll account for a smaller portion of the round. It\u2019s increasingly common for founders to push for co-leads or two main investors, one of whom is a name brand in the US and the other is a reputable local VC.</p>\n<p>What are Canadian VCs\u2019 unique advantages?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They likely have a much stronger local network than an international VC. By virtue of being located in your backyard, they\u2019re better tied into the local ecosystem and can help you hire and recruit advisors. Local VCs know who\u2019s looking for new opportunities, and have the relationship to influence those individuals in your favour.</li>\n<li>They help you <a href=\"http://www.lwlaw.com/what-is-a-ccpc/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">maintain your CCPC status</a>, which comes with a host of tax benefits. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>What are US VCs\u2019 unique advantages?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When companies need access to international networks and strategic partners, a US VC is well-positioned to facilitate those conversations by virtue of being located internationally. If you\u2019re building a regional sales office or advanced manufacturing center south of the border, an investor in that region is more likely to be able to make helpful introductions. The same applies with <a href=\"https://betakit.com/clearpath-robotics-raises-39-million-series-b-to-shift-focus-to-factory-material-transport/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">product and distribution partnerships</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But when we think US VCs, we\u2019re often limiting our analysis to the group of top-tier investors that have storied histories and have funded billion-dollar companies. These experienced investors are highly valuable in differentiated ways, but they\u2019re not uniquely American traits; the longevity of the US VC ecosystem has just bred more VC firms of this nature.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Experienced investors can share lessons learned. Think of <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110307006131/en/Kik-Interactive-Closes-8-Million-Series-Funding\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kik raising from early Tumblr investors</a> &#8211; the pattern recognition those VCs have is invaluable at accelerating growth and avoiding roadblocks.</li>\n<li>Experienced investors have a reputational benefit that can give your company a \u201chalo effect\u201d. If you\u2019re a consumer app entering the US market, announcing funding from a top-tier US consumer VC is a signal of legitimacy to potential hires and partners. A great example is <a href=\"https://betakit.com/drop-closes-25-8-million-series-a-repatriates-former-airbnb-exec/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Drop raising from NEA</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ultimately, a better way to consider the value you\u2019re getting from Canadian versus US investors is framing it instead around experience and years of investing. Compare a Canadian firm on its third or fourth fund to a US investor three months into its first fund. The Canadian VC will have more lessons learned, a stronger track record, and potentially deeper reputational benefits and relationships with strategic partners. If you\u2019re looking for an easy answer (spend 60 percent of your time pitching US VCs), there isn\u2019t one to be found!</p>\n<hr>\n<h4> Christian&#8217;s take:</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/christianlassonde150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Christian Lassonde\" width=\"175\" height=\"175\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-50164\" /> </p>\n<p>There is a benefit for founders to the size of Canadian VC ecosystem. For any one stage of investing, there are only about a dozen venture funds, (the exception being the early seed stage where there are maybe a few more). Developing a short list of funds whose investment thesis matches your company profile doesn\u2019t take that much time.*</p>\n<p>In comparison, there are something like 900 venture funds in the US. Meaning, for each stage of financing there are hundreds of firms. Getting in front of an exhaustive list of funds that fit your company requires a significant amount of time and resources. </p>\n<p>As Sarah correctly pointed out, there is no right way or right answer on which approach to take.</p>\n<p>Some of the more viable approaches include finding a Canadian VC lead who can help you navigate their US VC fund relationships. There are also some Canadian angels in the Valley who invest and advise startups on building US VC relationships. Lastly, there are programs like the C100&#8217;s 48 hours in the Valley. The C100 has built 48 hours around connecting Canadian startups to US VCs and clients.</p>\n<p>Whatever approach you take, it\u2019s essential to plan for the time it will take building US VC relationships well in advance of needing funding. The genuine risk of underestimating the time commitment means potentially driving your company off the cliff. If you think fundraising is hard, winding down your business because of failure to plan your fundraising is even harder.</p>\n<p>*Overall, the small size of the Canadian VC marketplace is a disadvantage. It should be much bigger. I\u2019m just trying to highlight a small benefit to the small size.</p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/ask-an-investor-should-i-prioritize-pitching-us-investors-over-canadians/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Ratio.City receives $100,000 from Communitech Fierce Founders Bootcamp Pitch Competition</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/ratio-city-receives-100000-from-communitech-fierce-founders-bootcamp-pitch-competition/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/ratio-city-receives-100000-from-communitech-fierce-founders-bootcamp-pitch-competition/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 12:00:12 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[funding]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=129791</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Communitech has announced the winner of the $100,000 prize for the pitch competition for its Fierce Founders bootcamp, which supports early-stage companies led women....]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>Communitech has announced the winner of the $100,000 prize for the pitch competition for its Fierce Founders bootcamp, which supports early-stage companies led women.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ratio.city/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ratio.City</a> ended up taking the top prize.

The response was impressive and the ideas were remarkable.\u201d </p>\n<p>The superclusters include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://oceansupercluster.ca/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ocean Supercluster</a> (based in Atlantic Canada) will work to improve competitiveness in Canada\u2019s ocean-based industries, including fisheries, oil and gas, and clean energy.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://aisupplychain.ca/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SCALE.AI Supercluster</a> (based in Quebec) will  build intelligent supply chains through artificial intelligence and robotics; this sector is targeted to the retail, manufacturing, and transport sector. </li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://ngmc.qreserve.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Advanced Manufacturing Supercluster</a> (based in Ontario) will connect Canada\u2019s technology strengths \u2014 mostly based in southern Ontario \u2014 to the manufacturing industry.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.proteinindustriescanada.ca/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Protein Industries Supercluster</a> (based in the Prairies) hopes to make Canada a leading source for plant proteins.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.digitalsupercluster.ca/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Technology Supercluster</a> (based in British Columbia) will use big data and digital technologies to unlock new potential in important sectors like healthcare, forestry, and manufacturing. Specifically, this sector wants to use advanced data collection, analytics, and visualization to build healthcare, natural resources, and industrial applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://betakit.com/navdeep-bains-says-not-for-profit-model-will-keep-superclusters-accountable/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Initially announced shortlisted clusters</a> that didn&#8217;t make the cut include Ontario&#8217;s cleantech supercluster; the Prairies&#8217; smart agri-food supercluster and smart, sustainable and resilient infrastructure supercluster; and Quebec&#8217;s mobility systems supercluster. </p>\n<p>The government says that these superclusters represent more than 450 businesses, 60 post-secondary institutions, and 180 other participants in sectors covering 78 percent of Canada\u2019s economy. Consortia are required to leverage funding from the private sector and co-invest dollar for dollar to match the federal contribution approved under the program.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur members welcome the government\u2019s focus on advancing domestic entrepreneurs and driving the growth of Canada\u2019s innovation outputs through its superclusters initiative,&#8221; said Ben Bergen, executive director of the Council of Canadian Innovators. &#8220;By injecting capital into high-growth Canadian firms while ensuring all winning proposals contain intellectual property strategies, the government is helping Canadian innovators scale up globally while ensuring a greater return on their investment.\u201d</p>\n<p>The government said that it wants to ensure that superclusters include a strong representation of women and under-represented groups, both working within the cluster and in leadership. When BetaKit spoke with Bains following the shortlist announcement, the Minister said that it would use a <a href=\"https://betakit.com/navdeep-bains-says-not-for-profit-model-will-keep-superclusters-accountable/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">not-for-profit model</a> to keep superclusters accountable.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We will make sure we look at diversity at the governance level, inclusion, measures around where commitments are made, how money is being deployed; is it meeting the mission and objective,\u201d Bains said at the time. </p>\n<p><em><strong> UPDATE 4:57 PM EST: BetaKit spoke with Minister Bains to get more insight into the supercluster winners and the process: </strong></em></p>\n<p>According to Minister Bains, each supercluster is receiving between $150 million to $250 million. The final list was determined based on economic benefit around growth, impact to GDP, jobs created, and intellectual property plans that include developing IP and commercializing in Canada. Working across government departments and industry experts, the government also looked at which industries would be the most competitive. </p>\n<p>Asked about the absence of blockchain and FinTech superclusters \u2014 where Canada has great potential to lead \u2014 Bains suggested that some superclusters simply did not make the criteria. </p>\n<p>&#8220;We really wanted to make sure we had a minimum of dollar per dollar match by these superclusters. We invested $950 million, and in this case, industry really stepped up and contributed $1.5 billion,&#8221; he said. </p>\n<p>&#8220;There\u2019s a range of factors: the level of ambition, the amount of money being invested, the partnerships that were engaged. When we started this proposal, we originally received 50 supercluster proposals that includes 1,000 companies. At the end we then had five finalists, and 450 businesses involved, and 300 plus were small businesses. </p>\n<p>&#8220;So there was a lot of realignment in the competitive process; when we announced the finalists of nine, those that did not make shortlist then worked with others on the shortlist to strengthen their proposal. That encouraged more competition and better outcomes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The finalists are responsible for creating their own plans to ensure that they are promoting diversity in leadership positions within the supercluster, and the government says it will monitor the progress of companies involved. </p>\n<p>Asked if there are any repercussions for companies that do not meet certain objectives, Bains said &#8220;I believe they will exceed expectations. This process has gotten a lot of ambition and a lot of goodwill, and there&#8217;s so many organizations involved that I&#8217;m confident that they&#8217;ll exceed numbers.&#8221;</p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/federal-govt-announces-winning-supercluster-proposals/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Unsplash raises $6.25 million Series A, will top up with $1 million SimpleTokens</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/unsplash-raises-6-25-million-series-a-will-top-up-with-1-million-simpletokens/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/unsplash-raises-6-25-million-series-a-will-top-up-with-1-million-simpletokens/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:00:14 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FinTech]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[funding]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Montreal]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=129643</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Unsplash has announced a funding round that includes tokens as the company looks to monetize its free stock photo platform.

OST.com, the blockchain technology company behind the \u201cSimple Token\u201d project, led the investment in Unsplash.</p>\n<p>Betaworks, InVision CEO Clark Valberg, Gigster CEO Roger Dickey, and Superhuman CEO Rahul Vohra are new investors in the round, with Accomplice and Real Ventures participating. </p>\n<p>\u201cUnsplash is a magical product that is democratizing photography and making quality digital imagery widely available and highly usable by individuals, developers, and businesses around the world,\u201d said OST CEO Jason Goldberg. \u201cWe jumped at the opportunity to partner with Unsplash to disrupt the incumbents by combining Unsplash\u2019s superior product with the game-changing potential of blockchain technology. The entire purpose of OST is help mainstream companies benefit from blockchain and we are hopeful that our partnership with Unsplash will prove to be a signature showcase of the power of OST. Together, there is a tremendous opportunity here to deliver one of the first mass-market use cases for blockchain.\u201d</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/02-feed-1024x722.png\" alt=\"unsplash\" width=\"690\" height=\"487\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-129647\" srcset=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/02-feed-1024x722.png 1024w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/02-feed-300x212.png 300w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/02-feed-768x542.png 768w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/02-feed-600x423.png 600w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/02-feed-823x580.png 823w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/02-feed.png 1553w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" /></p>\n<p>Unsplash has not yet received the tokens, but it hopes to launch its own token within the platform as a way to reward creators contributing free content to the site. </p>\n<p>Unsplash launched with the goal of making stock photos more accessible, as professional stock photos are traditionally licensed to the media organizations that can afford it. Unsplash promises both to give creators more access to photos, while photographers can build an audience and a reputation. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWe have a lot of growth and we have a strong community, and being able to pair it with Simpletoken puts us in a unique position.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of hiring activity that\u2019s happening within the site, and what we\u2019re trying to do is help everyone in this ecosystem benefit, and we think that will ultimately be the best thing for Unsplash as well,\u201d said Mikael Cho, founder of Unsplash. \u201cSo if we\u2019re able to help other people make money inside the ecosystem, so people who create great content, or brands who wan to work with other contributors and they want to exchange tokens in that that sort of way.\u201d </p>\n<p>The company is working with SimpleToken to figure out how a tokenized economy will work within the platform. \u201cWe think it\u2019s really powerful if we can create an ecosystem within that where people can exchange and then they have a medium for that exchange,\u201d Cho says. \u201cWe believe a lot in the philosophy behind what the blockchain represents, and it\u2019s basically modelled itself under what Unsplash is \u2014 which is essentially decentralized photography.\u201d</p>\n<p>Unsplash currently has 5.4 billion photos viewed per month, 10 photos downloaded per second, and over 48 billion photo views and 310 million photo downloads since 2013. While the metrics seem impressive, Cho says it\u2019s difficult for the interactions within the platform to get captured; when someone posts an image, it may be used several times, but a photographer wouldn\u2019t be able to track that activity. </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_94987\" style=\"max-width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/crew-88080.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/crew-88080-1024x726.jpg\" alt=\"crew\" width=\"690\" height=\"489\" class=\"size-large wp-image-94987\" srcset=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/crew-88080-1024x726.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/crew-88080-300x213.jpg 300w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/crew-88080-768x545.jpg 768w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/crew-88080-600x426.jpg 600w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/crew-88080-818x580.jpg 818w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/crew-88080.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Crew office.</p></div>\n<p>Cho wants to use part of the funding to make the platform more interactive, while continuing the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://betakit.com/unsplash-co-founder-mikael-cho-says-companys-focus-is-in-mobile-native-advertising/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">push to mobile</a>. The company, which recently <a href=\"https://medium.com/unsplash/medium-unsplash-2fee8d662dd1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced a partnership</a> with Medium, hopes to build more integrations with other products.

Women will get access to growth mentors and hands-on support to build tailored customer acquisition plans, land customer contracts, and reduce sales cycles. </p>\n<p>Participants will also immerse their company in the US market through an all-expenses paid trip to New York City \u2014 where <a href=\"https://betakit.com/dmz-launches-new-york-space-open-to-entrepreneurs-across-canada/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the DMZ has a satellite location</a> \u2014 to meet international investors and potential customers.

Fifty-seven percent surveyed believe their biggest barrier to acquiring customers is due to a lack of credibility, while 82 percent believe that customer acquisition is the most difficult milestone to reach. </p>\n<p>\u201cIf we want Canada to be a global technology leader, we need to be heavily focused on the advancement of women in our startup ecosystem,\u201d said Abdullah Snobar, executive director of the DMZ at Ryerson University. \u201cThe DMZ Women Founders program has been brought to life by serial entrepreneurs, industry leaders and months of research designed to create an efficient engine that advances the potential of entrepreneurs by solving the well-identified barriers in early market validation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sixty-six percent of women entrepreneurs do not have a mentor even though 84 per cent believe that a mentor would\u2019ve been helpful in the beginning stages of growing their business.  </p>\n<p>\u201cOften, when we talk about the women-in-tech pipeline, we fall short on retention \u2014 supporting the women founders who are currently in our ecosystem,\u201d said Kirstine Stewart, TribalScale&#8217;s president and <a href=\"https://betakit.com/kirstine-stewart-joining-tribalscale-as-president-and-chief-revenue-officer/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">chief revenue officer</a>. \u201cThe DMZ Women Founder program is tailored to provide founders with an inclusive space to receive the tools and mentorship needed to reach product-market fit &#8211; one of the key barriers for women founders of early-stage tech companies.\u201d</p>\n<p>Applications to the DMZ Women Founders program will open on February 15, 2018 and close on March 20, 2018 on <a href=\"http://dmz.to/womenfounders\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the official website</a>. </p>\n<p><em><br />\nPhoto by Natalia Dolan</em></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/dmz-launches-accelerator-supporting-women-founders/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>SingularityU wants to connect government and tech in Canada through exec program</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/singularityu-wants-to-connect-government-and-tech-in-canada-through-exec-program/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/singularityu-wants-to-connect-government-and-tech-in-canada-through-exec-program/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2018 20:45:45 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[niagara-on-the-lake]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=129623</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[SingularityU is seeking applications for the first Canadian edition of its executive program, which connects business leaders in Canada to talk strategically about how...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>S<a href=\"https://su.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ingularityU</a> is seeking applications for the first Canadian edition of its executive program, which connects business leaders in Canada to talk strategically about how tech leaders can tackle global challenges. </p>\n<p>The three-day program will include CEOs, deputy ministers from different provinces, and 12 faculty members from SingularityU in San Francisco to lead the program.

The company is using the funding towards growing the team behind its <a href=\"https://cto.ai/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CTO.ai</a> solution, which monitors issue balance, helps teams understand how quickly the team is shipping value to production, and measure velocity by metrics like repo, date, milestone, bug, and people.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are using these funds to grow our CTO.ai team across Canada and continue to execute on a mission to build the worlds most trusted platform for software companies to hire, train, retain and motivate software engineers to do the best work of their lives,&#8221; Kyle Campbell, CEO of Hack Capital, wrote in <a href=\"https://blog.hackcapital.com/hack-capital-oversubscribes-seed-round-1e31d312984\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a blog post</a>. Campbell is also a founder of Retsly, which was <a href=\"https://betakit.com/vancouvers-retsly-acquired-by-real-estate-marketplace-zillow/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">acquired by Zillow in 2014.</a> </p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s investors include:</p>\n<ul>\nGeoff Entress (Pioneer Square Labs), David Tedman (Invoke Media), Kevin Hobbs (Van Bex Ventures), Jonathan Bixby (Stanley Park Ventures), Brent Holliday (Garibaldi Capital), Mike Edwards (Initio Group), Chris Bissonnette (Pallasite Ventures), Conconi Growth Partners, David Hamilton, Chris Neumann (Datahero / 500 Startups), Colin Harris (PMC-Sierra), Alex Norman (TechTO / Angel List Canada), Barney Pell (Moon Express), Dave Johnson (Phone Gap / Adobe) &#038; Patrick Lor (Panache VC).\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;I invested for several reasons,&#8221; said Norman. &#8220;The founders are successful serial entrepreneurs. They are tackling a large problem: there is 4x more engineering jobs than engineers, and their solution, CTO.ai, is creating efficiencies to help bridge this gap and already has several great companies using it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the future, the company plans to launch verticals like CHRO.ai for HR, CRO.ai for measuring impact and plot trajectory, and CCO.ai to streamline the administration process. </p>\n<h3>GoFetch has raises $3.4 million for dogwalking app</h3>\n<p>Vancouver-based <a href=\"https://www.gofetch.ca/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GoFetch</a> has raised $3.4 million.</p>\n<p>The company, which allows dog owners to connect with people to care for their dogs, raised the funding from an undisclosed group of investors. \u201cWe look forward to enhancing our product and core service offerings for our customers and the dogs they love,\u201d said Willson Cross, the company\u2019s CEO. </p>\n<p>As dog-walking app Wag just raised $300 million from the SoftBank Vision fund and Seattle-based dogwalking app Rover raised $65 million last yer, Willson said that he anticipates more interest and investment in the space.</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom a competitive standpoint, we love the competition as it helps build awareness of the superior experience pet owners can receive through technology enabled platforms&#8230;this only makes going to new markets more efficient,\u201d Cross said. </p>\n<p>In May 2017, <a href=\"https://betakit.com/gofetch-raises-1-4-million-seed-round-expands-to-toronto/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the company raised a $1.4 million</a> seed round and launched in Toronto. </p>\n<p>While GoFetch connects dog owners with sitters, it said that its dog-walking service is its fastest-growing vertical.

Rates begin at $9 CAD per hour, including gas and insurance costs. Users will have access to 40 vehicles at launch, including the Chevrolet Cruze, Malibu, Tahoe, Trax and Volt, as well as the GMC Acadia and Yukon and the Cadillac ATS and XT5. </p>\n<p>Vehicle pick-up locations including Bloor West Village, Liberty Village, King West, the Entertainment District, Ryerson University, the Danforth, and the Eaton Centre.</p>\n<p>\u201cBringing Maven car-sharing to Toronto not only reduces congestion, but also represents the latest step in the development of General Motors\u2019 mobility footprint in Canada,\u201d said Steve Carlisle, president and managing director of GM Canada, in a February 12th, 2018 media release. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe launch of Maven follows the recent opening of our Canadian Technical Centre \u2014 Markham Campus, the largest automotive technology development centre of its kind in Canada and furthers our ability to bring new solutions to existing problems and redefine the future of mobility in Toronto and beyond.\u201d </p>\n<p>All Maven vehicles will also come with the OnStar infotainment platform, Wi-Fi, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and SiriusXM Radio. </p>\n<p>Maven was announced by General Motors in January 2016, with a trial program at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/02/13/maven-car-sharing-app-launches-toronto/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MobileSyrup</a></em></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/gm-launches-carsharing-pp-in-toronto/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Startup Canada Podcast Ep.123: The golden rules for hiring and firing</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/startup-canada-podcast-ep-123-the-golden-rules-for-hiring-and-firing/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/startup-canada-podcast-ep-123-the-golden-rules-for-hiring-and-firing/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2018 13:00:38 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Startup Canada]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=129563</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Knowing your rights as an employer is as crucial as knowing the implications of hiring and firing.

We had wonderful moments like this.\u201d </p>\n<p>Zak Hemraj, CEO of smart RFP response platform <a href=\"https://www.loopio.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Loopio</a>, shared a similar sentiment. \u201cDiversity in tech is vital for success, and you have no excuse to not participate in moving the needle forward.\u201d</p>\n<h3>The next wave of real \u201cnext-gen\u201d disruption looms</h3>\n<p>Diversity wasn\u2019t the only differentiator raised in the talks. The smart use of next generation technologies was also pinpointed as a critical component of success.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think the era of SaaS being new and different is over,\u201d said Paul Teshima, CEO of sales relationship management platform <a href=\"https://nudge.ai/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nudge.ai</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s now all about how you use next generation technologies to get a competitive advantage for the future.

He and his team are tackling the SalesForce-dominated CRM space with the help of artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think there is going to be a reset back to new companies recognizing there is a real opportunity to become not just a feature of existing tools, but to replace the tool and become not only a system of record, but a system of intelligence,\u201d said Hamoen.</p>\n<h3>The only way to get big is to solve big problems (carefully)</h3>\n<p>At the heart of discussions around new tech was perhaps the biggest theme of the event: the need to solve big problems.

This is the first Canadian investment for Munich and Berlin-based HV Holtzbrinck Ventures. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe are thrilled to have earned the trust of such a respected and diverse group of investors as we write our next chapter,\u201d said Cherif Habib, co-founder and CEO of Dialogue. \u201cThese funds will be strategically invested to continue our expansion and to launch new services to our clients.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p>Over the last year, close to 150 employers across a wide range of industries have started offering Dialogue.<br />\n&nbsp;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Dialogue&#8217;s platform allows the employers to offer employees access to healthcare services through their phone. Employees can chat with physicians and nurses and receive mental health therapy, free medication delivery, specialist referrals, and help navigating the healthcare system. In March 2017, the company raised <a href=\"https://betakit.com/montreal-based-dialogue-raises-4-million-announces-ontario-expansion/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a $4 million seed round</a> led by Diagram Ventures, which is backed by Power Financial, the company behind the Portag3 FinTech fund.</p>\n<p>In July, Dialogue partnered with League to <a href=\"https://betakit.com/league-partners-with-dialogue-to-launch-personalized-consumer-health-concierge/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">power its Health Concierge</a> in Ontario and British Columbia.

The company wants to use the funding to accelerate development of its online experiences, and support its growth both in North America and across the world. Frank And Oak is hoping to improve its product offerings and invest in its supply chain, and provide a more unified experience between online and brick-and-mortar customers. </p>\n<p>The company said it wants to implement artificial intelligence in its Style Plan program, <a href=\"https://betakit.com/today-in-company-updates-500px-flexiti-financial-eq-works-frank-oak/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a subscription-based service</a> that allows users to purchase items tailored to them based on past purchases.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Frank + Oak also plans to expand its product offering, create new styles, and invest in its supply chain.<br />\n&nbsp;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u201cFrank And Oak is extremely proud to have obtained the support of exceptional investors in this round of financing led by the Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec,\u201d said Ethan Song, co-founder and CEO of Frank And Oak. \u201cOur alliance with this strong institution and our other key partners demonstrates the level of confidence in our business.

Without paying close attention to where we&#8217;re headed, and doing the required work, even the best us can look up and find ourselves a long way from where we thought we&#8217;d be.</p>\n<p>Members of the Canadian tech and business community have been signing the #weneedboth pledge, claiming the need for rich and inclusive conversations about gender diversity in tech. But what are these tech luminaries actually pledging <em>to do</em>, and why does the whole thing read so&#8230; gendered? Maybe Canadian tech should spend less time making pledges and more time acting on them.</p>\n<p>And now for something completely different: porn. Porn has long been at the forefront of cutting-edge tech, whether or not we actually want to admit it. Now, the porn industry (and all those &#8216;social media platforms&#8217; that rely so heavily on porn for traffic) is banding together to stop &#8216;deepfakes&#8217; porn. Why is this important? For one, deepfakes porn (and the technology behind it) is horrifying. More importantly, this isn&#8217;t about porn; it&#8217;s about a battle for truth on the Internet.</p>\n<p>What happens when the technology to create deepfakes videos becomes democratize like real videos were with YouTube and smartphones? We live in a world where your digital representation <em>is</em> you. Even if it&#8217;s not real. What happens when you can&#8217;t tell the real from the fake anymore?

The government backed away from that promise in its first budget announced <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/03/22/liberals-reverse-stand-on-stock-options-small-business-tax-rate.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in March 2016</a> after outcry from the startup community, which stressed that stock options are used to attract key talent. </p>\n<p>\u201cChanges to the way stock options are taxed would have disastrous impacts on the ability of Canadian firms to scale into global technology giant,&#8221; said Ben Bergen, executive director of the Council of Canadian Innovators. &#8220;We strongly urge the NDP to meet with our members to better understand the access to talent challenges CEOs are facing, and to not advocate for a cap on employee stock options, which would hinder the industry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Finance Canada has said that the stock option deduction cost the federal treasury about $840 million last year. Critics also say that most stock options in Canada are given to wealthy senior executives. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe world for most Canadians is increasingly unaffordable, involves more precarious work, and is a harder place in which to get by. Meanwhile, the wealthy and well-connected live in another world \u2013 an exclusive club with special access that exempts them from rules the rest of us play by,&#8221; said Peter Julian, the NDP&#8217;s finance critic. &#8220;This is both unfair and damaging to our country\u2019s economy,\u201d said Julian. \u201cCanadians deserve comprehensive, progressive tax reform focused on fairness today. The Prime Minister can take concrete steps in this year\u2019s budget to ensure the richest Canadians contribute their fair share.\u201d</p>\n<p>A vote on the motion is expected on Tuesday. </p>\n<p><em>Photo by Julian Tang from <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/peter-julian-ndp-leadership-race-1.3811726\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Canadian Press</a></em></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/ndp-wants-to-force-vote-on-capping-employee-stock-options/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Former Bank of Nova Scotia VP joins Portag3 Ventures as CFO</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/former-bank-of-nova-scotia-vp-joins-portag3-ventures-as-cfo/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/former-bank-of-nova-scotia-vp-joins-portag3-ventures-as-cfo/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2018 18:28:50 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FinTech]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[vc]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=129361</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Portag3 has announced that it is appointing Stephan Klee as CFO for Portag3 Ventures.

It will also be used in brick-and-mortar stores to process transactions on iPads, and for digital screens displaying product and health information like product information, use guidelines, and social responsibility information. Health information will be available both in-store and online. </p>\n<p>The OCRC is in the process of determining UX design, and plans to have the platform ready for the proposed federal marijuana legalization launch in July 2018.

Product managers meet once a week for three hours outside of their vocational placement to focus on industry practices, case studies, workshops, debate, and soft skills development like working on a team and thinking creatively.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;If we run it a few times, in three years&#8217; time, we&#8217;ll have 50 plus trained product managers in Toronto with a network.&#8221;<br />\n&#8211; Tom Walsham\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The first cohort of the program is being led by TWG, Freshbooks, Shopify, Wattpad, League, Chefhero, Roadmunk, Tulip Retail, and ecobee. Seema Lakhani, head of product at Wattpad and one of the leaders of the APM program, started an internal program at Wattpad several years ago to deal with her own recruiting problem. She mentored Wattpad employees that had some of the fundamentals and skills to become product managers, but lacked the experience to be fully prepared to take on the role. </p>\n<p>\u201cProduct management, as far as I&#8217;d say in traditional tech jobs, is one of the younger ones. It&#8217;s one of the least understood field and has less of a built-in base of talent compared to other roles,&#8221; said Lakhani. &#8220;Building capacity around product is really important as different cities develop and grow in their innovation economy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There is no standardized path to become a product manager, meaning that companies often have their own unique approaches to product development. The program doesn\u2019t promote a specific methodology for that reason, instead giving participants access to different approaches and encouraging self-directed learning. </p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;By coming together, we can create critical mass, and we&#8217;re able to bring a diversity of challenges to the table.&#8221;<br />\n&#8211; Jeremy Bailey<br />\n&nbsp;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The program is open to individuals that have some foundation to prepare them for product management; requirements include a university degree in \u201csomething interesting,\u201d an understanding of the software lifecycle, and strong communication skills.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe mentorship is critical. You can&#8217;t just give people a weekly session and train them. This is not about pushing information to people, it&#8217;s about creating the network and that platform to grow in their careers,\u201d said TWG VP of product Tom Walsham.</p>\n<p>The program was inspired by the model of Silicon Valley product companies, which Marissa Mayer pioneered when she was Google\u2019s VP of Product in 2002, after having trouble keeping up with demand for product managers within the company. The program has since been picked up by companies like Twitter, Hootsuite, and Linkedin. </p>\n<p>Since Toronto area companies don\u2019t have the scale and resources of Valley companies running in-house rotational programs, the APM program takes a collaborative approach with several leaders coming together to build up talent in the community. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re treating this cohort like a product prototype, [with] someone who is just starting out as product manager, who we&#8217;re calling an associate product manager inside the company,\u201d said Jeremy Bailey, creative director for product at Freshbooks. \u201cWe&#8217;re looking for partners who have a candidate looking for more curriculum to accelerate their career. By coming together, we can create critical mass, and we&#8217;re able to bring a diversity of challenges to the table.\u201d</p>\n<p>The goal of the program is to provide a framework for other organizations in other markets to replicate. Applications for the next cohort will open in spring 2018. </p>\n<p>\u201cIf we run it a few times, in three years&#8217; time, we&#8217;ll have 50 plus trained product managers in Toronto with a network and everyone benefits because we don&#8217;t know what individuals&#8217; career paths are,\u201d said Walsham. </p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/startups-launch-apm-program-bringing-valley-model-to-canadian-product-managers/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>R&#124;T: The Retail Times &#8211; Walmart&#8217;s tech makeover</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/rt-the-retail-times-walmarts-tech-makeover/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/rt-the-retail-times-walmarts-tech-makeover/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2018 13:00:41 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Amira Zubairi]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[retail]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=129283</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The Retail Times is a weekly newsletter covering retail tech news from Canada and around the globe.

Here\u2019s the latest on Canada\u2019s movers and shakers.</p>\n<h3>FreshBooks adds over 50 apps and integrations to redesigned platform</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.freshbooks.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FreshBooks</a> announced that it now offers more than 65 apps and integrations for its new FreshBooks platform, up from 16 when it launched in September 2016.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur mission at FreshBooks is to reshape the world to suit the needs of self-employed professionals and their teams,\u201d said Mike McDerment, co-founder and CEO of FreshBooks. \u201cOur recently redesigned platform was a big step forward to enable us to do more, faster for our customers, and that has included the rapid expansion of complementary apps and integrations. We\u2019re proud to introduce our customers to an ecosystem of best-in-class technologies that, in addition to the FreshBooks platform, will make it even easier, simpler and faster to run a small business.\u201d</p>\n<p>To date, FreshBooks said it has helped over 10 million people across 160 countries send invoices, track their time, manage expenses, and get paid online. Recently added integrations provide more options for automating workflow and reducing administrative tasks. </p>\n<p>Other apps and integrations available with FreshBooks include connector tools such as Zapier and OneSaas; CRM and marketing integrations such as Salesforce and MailChimp; and project management integrations such as Basecamp, Trello, and Asana.</p>\n<p>In July 2017, FreshBooks raised <a href=\"https://betakit.com/freshbooks-raises-57-million-to-invest-in-north-american-expansion/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a $57 million funding round</a> to expand its platform. </p>\n<h3>Jiffy on Demand launches in the US</h3>\n<p>Toronto-based <a href=\"https://jiffyondemand.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jiffy on Demand</a>, which offers an app to connect people to home maintenance services, has officially launched in the US through Boston. </p>\n<p>\u201cHome maintenance repairs never come at a good time, and with everyone always on-the-go, the process of having to stop everything and scour for a reputable handyman isn\u2019t realistic anymore,\u201d said Ryan Shupak, co-founder and CEO of Jiffy. \u201cJiffy is changing the way consumers think about home maintenance by helping them schedule the work instantly, on their schedule, and we\u2019re excited to bring that valuable service to Boston.\u201d</p>\n<p>The platform allows users to request home maintenance from trade professionals nearby who are vetted by the company. In turn, trade professionals can automate the tasks of marketing, lead chasing, appointment scheduling, route optimization planning, and payment collection. The company says it has over 30,000 jobs on the books already.</p>\n<p>\u201cJiffy eliminates the challenge of having to coordinate the homeowner\u2019s timeline with a service professionals\u2019 location and availability,\u201d said Dave Spina, general manager of Jiffy\u2019s Boston location. \u201cJust days after signing up with Jiffy, home repair service contractors already see an increase in the number of jobs that they can complete per day. It\u2019s like having an office manager in the palm of their hand and has proven to be a huge asset for building their business pipeline.\u201d </p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/today-in-company-updates-freshbooks-adds-over-50-apps-to-new-platform-jiffy-on-demand-announces-us-launch/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>AceTech Ontario rebrands to Peerscale</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/acetech-ontario-rebrands-to-peerscale/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/acetech-ontario-rebrands-to-peerscale/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 09 Feb 2018 21:03:38 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[impact]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=129203</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[AceTech Ontario has rebranded to Peerscale in an effort to better reflect its mission of connecting tech leaders.

Every member has access to a dedicated, trusted, and valuable personal advisory board, called a peergroup. Peerscale has 15 peergroups for CEOs, COOs, sales, marketing, finance, human resources, technology, product, and customer success executives. </p>\n<p>Peerscale currently has over 200 members that represent over 120 tech companies in the GTA, Whitby, Kitchener-Waterloo regions, including companies like Wealthsimple, TribalScale, and HiMama. The organization says these companies generate $1.8 billion in combined revenues and employ more than 11,000 people.</p>\n<p>The name was chosen to better reflect the organization\u2019s goal of collective learning and education through shared experiences. </p>\n<p>\u201cRebranding allowed us to truly define our offering and who we are to our members. With this new brand that more effectively communicates the significant value we deliver to technology leaders, Peerscale is incredibly well positioned to continue the outstanding growth our organization has experienced,\u201d said Mark Jaine, Peerscale board chair and Intelex CEO. \u201cWe are proud of the new brand, identity, and positioning, and look forward to another incredible year ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peerscale also launched a mobile app for exclusive use by Peerscale members and corporate partners. It provides access to the entire membership base, corporate partners, discounted services, content, and calendar of events.</p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/acetech-ontario-rebrands-to-peerscale/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Today in blockchain: Bluzelle raises $24.4M CAD in ICO, RightMesh launching emergency communications app</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/today-in-blockchain-bluzelle-raises-24-4m-cad-in-ico-rightmesh-launching-emergency-communications-app/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/today-in-blockchain-bluzelle-raises-24-4m-cad-in-ico-rightmesh-launching-emergency-communications-app/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 09 Feb 2018 17:37:59 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FinTech]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[vancouver]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=128765</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Over the past few weeks, several blockchain companies have made announcements launching new features and expanding their technologies.

Here\u2019s the latest on these company updates.</p>\n<h3> Bluezelle raises $24.4 million CAD in ICO </h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://bluzelle.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bluzelle</a>, a decentralized database provider, has closed $24.4 million CAD in an ICO, which it will use towards developing its decentralized database technology. </p>\n<p>Currently based in Singapore, Bluzelle was founded in Vancouver. The company says that it&#8217;s filling a &#8220;major piece&#8221; in the decentralized internet by providing data storage and management; currently, Filecoin and Storj provide file storage systems, but dApp developers also need data storage and management systems capable of fast and simple data queries to build the full range of services on the decentralized internet.</p>\n<p>\u201cSelling out the crowdsale is a huge milestone in the growth of our company and our journey to deliver a product that will be a key component of the new, better Internet,&#8221; said Bluzelle CEO Pavel Bains. &#8220;We have been into this technology for years and the CEOs and CTOs we work with are just as enthusiastic as us about the product, technology and the future. With this funding, we will now be able to bring our decentralized database to everyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>On day one, 360 buyers took part, which was a 85 percent turnout for group one. On day two, 6,698 buyers took part, which was a 95 percent turnout for Group two. By day three, there were just under 2 million tokens left of the 165 million made available for sale, and both previous groups were able to take part on a first-come-first-served basis. This final round sold out in under five seconds.</p>\n<p>In total, 500 million tokens had been generated, so the 165 million that were sold represented 33 percent of the total. Investors included Kenetic Capital, Hashed, Kryptonite 1 and 8 Decimal Capital.</p>\n<p>In August 2017, Bluzelle raised $1.5 million in Series A funding round that was backed by venture capital firms Global Brain, LUN Partners Capital and True Global Ventures.</p>\n<h3> RightMesh launching offline emergency communications app </h3>\n<p>Vancouver-based <a href=\"https://www.rightmesh.io/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">RightMesh</a>, which is using mesh networking and blockchain technology to enable offline connectivity, announced plans to launch Flare in Q2 of this year.</p>\n<p>The company began working on the platform in the wake of a tsunami alert in BC. Users can download the Flare app as a backup for communication in case of disruption to phone and internet service. Key features under development include P2P, text, photo, audio, and location messages, blasting messages for help sent to anyone available in the mesh, the ability to post and respond to requests for items such as water, pet food, or a generator, and the ability to share location on downloaded maps so users can geolocate each other.</p>\n<p>\u201cWith two offices and about 100 developers in Bangladesh, we have experienced firsthand the pain of subpar connectivity,&#8221; said CEO and co-founder of John Lyotier. \u201cOur own developers provided the catalyst for RightMesh when they developed a rudimentary offline communications app to use as an in-office work around.  With more than half the world lacking connectivity and all the economic and social benefits that come with it, we knew then that developing what has evolved into RightMesh was the \u2018right\u2019 thing to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>An additional concept RightMesh has been developing is a drone that can function as a node in the mesh to enhance Flare\u2019s utility to help rescue efforts. With the autonomous connectivity of the mesh network, the drone could fly over affected areas and instantly detect autonomous blast messages or \u2018Flares\u2019 asking for help from within 100 metres or anyone that is mesh connected. The drone could then return to a base or internet-connected zone to relay the information to rescue workers.  </p>\n<p>Mesh networks allow smartphones and IoT devices to piggyback off each other as nodes in a network, rather than forcing all devices to rely on one central tower.

People may remember Stephen Harper\u2019s attack ads on that. They were false. We actually moved forward in demonstrating that we were not going to raise taxes on consumers, who pay enough for their Internet at home.\u201d </p>\n<p>NDP MP Guy Caron later suggested that it wasn\u2019t fair that Netflix has to pay neither sales nor income tax. </p>\n<p>In response, Prime Minister Trudeau stated: \u201cWe are not going to raise taxes on Canadians. That is what the NDP is asking us to do. We recognize that the media environment and television viewing and production are changing rapidly. That is why we reached out and got Netflix to make historic investments in our content creators here in Quebec and Canada, to help them succeed in this changing universe. We have a great deal of confidence in our creators; the approach we have chose is a testament to that.\u201d </p>\n<p>Ever since the federal government\u2019s announcement of its Creative Canada plan in September 2017, the lack of taxation for US-based Netflix has been a contentious point. </p>\n<p>In January 2018, a coalition of 45 Canadian media organizations requested a meeting with federal Minister of Finance Bill Morneau to urge a reconsideration of the government\u2019s Netflix Tax stance. </p>\n<p>Quebec Finance Minister Carlos Leitao has also spoken publicly about the province\u2019s intention of charging provincial sales tax on Netflix. </p>\n<p>As part of the Creative Canada plan, Heritage Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly revealed the creation of a first-of-its-kind Netflix Canada production company, as well as a $500 million CAD commitment to invest in original Canadian productions over the next five years.</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/02/08/prime-minister-trudeau-closes-the-door-on-netflix-sales-tax/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MobileSyrup</a></em></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/prime-minister-trudeau-reiterates-governments-firm-opposition-to-netflix-tax/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>CIFAR announces advisory committee overseeing national AI strategy</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/cifar-announces-advisory-committee-overseeing-national-ai-strategy/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/cifar-announces-advisory-committee-overseeing-national-ai-strategy/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 09 Feb 2018 16:10:14 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[AI]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[govt]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=129167</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[CIFAR has announced its International Scientific Advisory Committee that will oversee the Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy.

Depending on the municipality, it will also collect up to three percent in municipal and regional sales taxes (MRDT).</p>\n<p>According to the provincial government, the new revenue will add approximately $16 million annually to the province\u2019s coffers, while the regional sales tax is expected to bring in $5 million annually. The $16 million and $5 million are earmarked toward affordable housing and promoting local tourism, respectively.</p>\n<p>\u201cBritish Columbians want access to the sharing economy \u2013 and they want it to be fair,\u201d said BC finance minister Carole James. \u201cThis initiative will provide additional revenues to address housing affordability, and it improves tax fairness for all British Columbians.\u201d </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Alex Dagg, public policy manager for Airbnb in Canada, said, \u201cThis is a defining moment for Airbnb in British Columbia.\u201d </p>\n<p>She added, \u201cThese changes are a welcome opportunity to continue helping the province and its residents benefit from the positive economic impacts of home sharing.\u201d </p>\n<p>The agreement is the first of its kind for the province, though governments in other jurisdictions like Michigan, Nevada and California, Airbnb\u2019s home state, have implemented similar measures. Closer to home, in 2017 Quebec instituted a province-wide 3.5 percent Airbnb tax. </p>\n<p>In the future, the provincial government plans to reach similar agreements with other rental platforms like VRBO. There are currently approximately 18,500 Airbnb hosts in BC.</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/02/08/airbnb-bc-provincial-sales-tax/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MobileSyrup</a></em></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/airbnb-reaches-agreement-to-collect-provincial-municipal-taxes-in-bc/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Ask an Investor: How do I prepare for my first board meeting?</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/ask-an-investor-how-do-i-prepare-for-my-first-board-meeting/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/ask-an-investor-how-do-i-prepare-for-my-first-board-meeting/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 09 Feb 2018 12:00:42 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Christian Lassonde]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[ask an investor]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Feature]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[vc]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=129113</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Welcome to a BetaKit weekly series designed to help startups and entrepreneurs.

Each week, investors tackle the tough questions facing founders today. Have a question you would like answered? Tweet them with the #askaninvestor hashtag, or email them <a href=\"mailto:askaninvestor@betakit.com\" target=\"_top\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<hr width=\"20%\" />\n<p>I remember my first board meeting. I was a summer intern at a fast-growing tech company, and the founder wanted to give the summer interns the opportunity to experience a board meeting first hand. That formative experience was a huge benefit to me when later on I started my first company. I already had a rough inkling of what&#8217;s involved in a typical board meeting. Most first-time founders aren&#8217;t so lucky and go into their first board meeting a bit blind. </p>\n<p>Having to deal with board meetings is a good sign, as it usually means you&#8217;ve managed to raise some institutional money. Having professional investors on your cap table comes with having to run professional board meetings. I&#8217;ll do my best to outline what&#8217;s involved and what to expect here.</p>\n<h3>The basics </h3>\n<p>A board meeting is exactly what it sounds like: a meeting of the members of the board of directors. Beyond board members, the executive team of the company is also typically invited to the meetings to present to the board, especially the CFO. As well, investors on the board will often bring along an analyst or associate as an observer. </p>\n<p>Most companies call board meetings every three months. They typically last two to three hours. </p>\n<h3>Pre-reads</h3>\n<p>For your board to come prepared and be efficient at the meeting, it&#8217;s critical that the management team prepare pre-read material. The pre-read material should ideally go out a week before the board meeting and certainly no later than half a week prior.</p>\n<p>The main document of a board package is the board presentation. It typically contains all the relevant information and will be used as a support for the actual board meeting. Other documents in the package are the quarterly/annual financial statements, pro-forma models, minutes from committee meetings and the prior board meetings and any other supporting documents the management team might deem necessary.</p>\n<h3>Level of detail</h3>\n<p>As you prepare the board presentations, recall that directors work with the company but not within the company. Internal company jargon will mostly be meaningless to your external board members. Do not use any unexplained abbreviation or technical jargon in your presentation.</p>\n<p>Information used should be meaningful: when presenting data, always answer the question: \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d. Every piece of data given should serve a purpose. Trim unnecessary details. The board needs differ from the management ones, so the presentation should be focused on the information the board needs to make decisions.</p>\n<p>Finding the right balance of detail is always tricky. It&#8217;s advisable to err on the side of too much detail vs. too little. Your board members will likely give you feedback after each meeting. Over time you should be able to calibrate to your board members desired level of detail.</p>\n<h3>Presentation content</h3>\n<p>It\u2019s crucial the board presentation covers the breadth of the company&#8217;s activities and efficiently communicates these activities to the board. From my own experience the following is a good starting point to prepare an initial board deck:</p>\n<h5>Agenda</h5>\n<li> Pre-assign some timing to each topic.</li>\n<h5>Approvals </h5>\n<li>Approve agenda. </li>\n<li>Approve previous board meeting minutes. </li>\n<h5>CEO overview</h5>\n<li>Summarizing the key accomplishments and issues of the company since last board meeting.</li>\n<li>Alternatively: the CEO Overview can be one to two-page letter to the board outside of board deck.</li>\n<h5>Overall business update</h5>\n<li>Company-wide KPI review.</li>\n<h5>Business development update</h5>\n<li>Sales KPIs.</li>\n<li>Sales pipeline: $ estimated funnel, highlights and challenges.</li>\n<h5>Financial update </h5>\n<li>Balance sheet, P&#038;L, and cash positions as well as key metrics: cash burn, margin percent.</li>\n<li>Provide simplified financial overview in the slide presentation, full documents should be separate.</li>\n<li>If required, annually budget approval.</li>\n<h5>Product update</h5>\n<li>Product roadmap.</li>\n<li>Product development. </li>\n<h5>Strategic discussion </h5>\n<li>Decisions taken and any documentation supporting submissions that require decisions.</li>\n<li>Strategic discussion on new topics.</li>\n<h5>HR update</h5>\n<li>Org chart and headcount by department.</li>\n<li>Discussion of key hires.</li>\n<li>Includes new hires and headcount additions for next two to three quarters.</li>\n<h5>Asks: What does management need from the board</h5>\n<h5>Optional and/or appendix </h5>\n<li>Operations update.</lI>\n<li>Team news by department.</li>\n<h5>Approval of options grants</h5>\n<h5>In-camera session</h5>\n<li>The agenda should set time apart for an in camera session. This is a private session taking place only with non-executive board members present.</li>\n<h5>Approval of adjournment </h5>\n<h3>Tips</h3>\n<p>Having the content right is one step closer to a good board meeting. But to make it great, here are a few more general tips:</p>\n<li>Stick to your agenda and be time conscious. It is essential that you have the time to cover the whole presentation within the time frame you\u2019ve planned.</li>\n<li>The presentation should adopt an easy to read or easy to digest style: go for bullet points rather than long paragraphs. Highlight, bold or underline critical points. Always double check for spelling or grammar errors. Reference your document using page and section numbers matching the agenda.</li>\n<li>Lastly, once you have created your first board meeting package, use it as a template for your next meetings to reach uniformity and consistency across meetings.</li>\n<p>You&#8217;re ready now to prepare for your first board meeting!</p>\n<hr width=\"20%\" />\n<h4> Sarah&#8217;s take</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/14882366_10157709816720253_5583206595414963638_o-1.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Marion\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-50164\" /></p>\n<p>Christian\u2019s commentary on pre-read material is a really important one that deserves extra emphasis. </p>\n<p>A week in advance can seem like overkill. You\u2019re probably wondering, \u201cCan\u2019t my investors just read the package on the plane or over breakfast the morning of the meeting?\u201d No. Board meetings are a blend of tactical and strategic discussions, and you should be aiming to maximize time spent on strategic topics as much as possible. </p>\n<p>Yes, you need to approve option grants, and provide an updated cash balance; these topics won\u2019t take much time in the meeting nor will your investors linger on these points during their pre-read. </p>\n<p>But most of the board meeting will be spent on meaty topics: your mission, the hard trade-offs in spending you\u2019re planning to make, the challenges facing your company, if those challenges overcome by more marketing spend, a more experienced executive in that job function, or a true pivot away from that strategy. These conversation topics take time for your board to absorb, and the best guidance comes when there\u2019s time for your proposals to percolate in your investors\u2019 minds. If you deny them time to review the deck, you\u2019re denying yourself their best advice.</p>\n<p><em>Got a question for the investors?

In an industry where men already dominate many panels, the pledge calls on women to advocate for men, while men are not asked to do the same; those speaking out against the pledge said that men should be more focused on being in the audience listening. The initiative also seems trans-exclusionary, by not recognizing people who don\u2019t identify as male or female.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If people think your diversity and inclusion initiative&#39;s marketing launch is a 4chan prank, you&#39;re probably doing it wrong. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/weneedboth?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#weneedboth</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Melissa Nightingale (@shappy) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shappy/status/961683217525821440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 8, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>&#8220;The premise, if managed well, is okay.

Also, from what I can tell, it\u2019s headed by a team of white women, so I am hoping that they will do the necessary work to ensure that the intersections of race, ability, gender, and class are considered.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The #weneedboth initiative is reportedly inspired by a similar movement in Australia which asked men business leaders to <a href=\"http://malechampionsofchange.com/commit-to-the-panel-pledge/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> pledge that they would not join panels</a> that did not include women. It does not appear that the Australian movement also required women to advocate for men. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe diversity conversation does need more men. In the audience. Listening and learning and quietly using their power for change. Not re-centering the conversation on their perspectives,\u201d said Johnathan and Melissa Nightingale, founders of Raw Signal Group, when asked by BetaKit for comment.</p>\n<hr width=\"20%\" />\n<p><strong> UPDATE: 02/09/17 at 15:33 PM EST </strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://weneedboth.co\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#weneedboth website</a> has been updated, and the organization has removed the separate calls to action for men and women. The website instead calls for all genders to commit to ensuring panels on gender advancement are as inclusive as possible, and invites supporters to send tactical ideas on building a more inclusive society. </p>\n<p>The co-founders have also removed their names from the About section, though a similar call to action \u2014 for women to ask organizers to include &#8220;diverse perspectives,&#8221; on panels about gender diversity, while men can &#8220;raise their hand&#8221; to show that they want to participate \u2014 remains at the bottom of the page. </p>\n<p><strong> UPDATE: 02/09/17 at 10:09 AM EST </strong></p>\n<p>Michelle McBane, managing director of StandUp Ventures, provided the following comment to BetaKit: </p>\n<p>&#8220;The wording of the pledge was unfortunate; however, I fundamentally believe that we need all stakeholders in the community actively involved in this discussion \u2013 I believe that was the spirit of the pledge and that\u2019s why I signed.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong> UPDATE: 02/09/17 at 10:09 AM EST </strong></p>\n<p>Michelle McBane, managing director of StandUp Ventures, provided the following comment to BetaKit: </p>\n<p>&#8220;The wording of the pledge was unfortunate; however, I fundamentally believe that we need all stakeholders in the community actively involved in this discussion \u2013 I believe that was the spirit of the pledge and that\u2019s why I signed.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong> UPDATE: 02/08/17 at 17:42 PM EST </strong></p>\n<p>Jodi Kovitz, founder of Move The Dial, sent the following statement to BetaKit: </strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;I believe there are nuances in the messaging that need to be improved, including being inclusive of all genders (not only people who identify as men or women) which I communicated today to Laura [McGee]. However, I support the idea that we need everyone to work together to advance women, and that while in some ways the pledge missed the mark, the more we collectively focus on positivity and good the further we go: and I know that the intentions of the creators of this initiative were good. They are open to feedback, and will take it to improve.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong> UPDATE: 02/08/17 at 16:42 PM EST </strong></p>\n<p>BetaKit spoke with #weneedboth founder Laura McGee, who said that the intention of #weneedboth is to ensure that discussions on gender are as inclusive as possible, which means ensuring representation from all groups. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I definitely wouldn&#8217;t say that we\u2019re asking women to advocate for men. At the end of the day what we&#8217;re worried about is having a panel of women speaking to a room full of women and preaching to the choir. The objective here is to encourage women who are asked to speak on panels about gender advancement to ask organizers to ensure that it&#8217;s inclusive and that we get a diversity of perspectives,&#8221; she said. </p>\n<p>McGee also said that it was &#8220;not acceptable&#8221; for men to isolate themselves and retreat during these conversations. &#8220;We&#8217;re asking men to put themselves out there and say, &#8216;I&#8217;d love to be part of the solution, and I&#8217;d love to join these conversations and be part of these panels or at least listen in, so I can learn what I can do personally to be an ally of the movement.&#8221;</p>\n<p>McGee said that #weneedboth is reaching out to people who have voiced concerns and working to improve their messaging and come up with tactical solutions for all genders. On feedback that the language used was trans-exclusionary, she said that the organization will update its messaging with the understanding that gender is not binary. </p>\n<p><strong>League CEO Mike Serbinis also added this commentary: </strong> </p>\n<p>&#8220;It is up to both men and women to ensure gender diversity and advancement takes place in the workforce. At League, we encourage rich and inclusive discussions about gender diversity. Our internal HR team is dedicated to creating company-wide programs to help achieve an even stronger and more diverse workforce and culture.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Feature photo courtesy <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/bMclPCvSHLo\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a>.</em></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/canadian-tech-leaders-sign-weneedboth-pledge-asking-women-to-advocate-for-men-on-diversity-panels/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Tech for Good: Brili applies enterprise tech to child psychology</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/tech-for-good-brili-applies-enterprise-tech-to-child-psychology/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/tech-for-good-brili-applies-enterprise-tech-to-child-psychology/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2018 21:06:06 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Stefan Palios]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[impact]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[saas]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[sponsor]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tech for Good]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=129045</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[As part of a regular series powered by IBM, BetaKit interviews Canadian tech leaders using innovation for the greater good.

However, there\u2019s also another kind of innovation that applies new technologies to problems where the current solution is correct in theory, but impossible to implement in practice. </p>\n<p>Caring for a child with a learning disability requires the latter kind of innovation. </p>\n<p>Inspired by founder Pierre S\u00e9guin\u2019s time as a software development team lead, <a href=\"https://brili.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Brili</a> is a system that uses gamification to empower children with learning disabilities. </p>\n<p>The app helps children follow a routine and receive a reward for completion, per psychologist-documented best practices. The technology uses IBM Cloud to help provide a real-time tracking dashboard for parents. Brili is currently working to add artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms to enhance its existing trend analysis features. </p>\n<h3> The parent trap</h3>\n<p>\u201cMy goal is for families to enjoy their time together without getting upset, and for kids to have self-confidence in their ability to get through daily life,\u201d said S\u00e9guin. </p>\n<p>Child psychology has well-documented processes for working with children that suffer from ADD, ADHD, and other learning disabilities, explained S\u00e9guin. Common among them is the requirement for a consistent, easy-to-follow routine. Further, the child needs patience from parents and the ability to self-manage as much as possible. </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_129071\" style=\"max-width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/brili3.png\" alt=\"Brili\" width=\"750\" height=\"532\" class=\"size-full wp-image-129071\" srcset=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/brili3.png 750w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/brili3-300x213.png 300w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/brili3-600x426.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Brili platform</p></div>\n<p>\u201cThe process is well-known,\u201d S\u00e9guin continued. \u201cThe problem arises when the parent is unable to follow best practices.\u201d </p>\n<p>Without the right technology, parents often juggle many tools to help their child with a consistent routine: a written list of daily tasks, a timer or other method of staying on track, a reward to encourage good behaviour, and enough patience themselves to outlast the tantrums. </p>\n<p>\u201cSome are very lucky to have parents who can invest the time to help them through the day, but the majority of parents are just doing the best they can with limited time and resources,\u201d noted S\u00e9guin. </p>\n<h3> An enterprise-grade solution </h3>\n<p>The platform that S\u00e9guin built to help parents and kids alike uses a gamified, kid-facing dashboard accessed through an iOS or Android app or web browser. Parents set up the routine, but the process is entirely kid-owned. </p>\n<p>\u201cUsing a cloud-based solution, kids log into the app and receive a prompt for their daily routine,\u201d explained S\u00e9guin. \u201cAs kids receive guidance from the app and complete activities, they mark it in the app, hopefully before the allotted time for the task runs out. Every second that they save from doing their tasks quickly adds to their free time reward at the end.\u201d </p>\n<blockquote><p>Pierre S\u00e9guin originally got the idea for Brili as an agile software product owner. </p></blockquote>\n<p>With the Brili app, the kid is in control. They get the confidence of checking a task as complete, and feel motivated to beat the timer because it means they get a reward, S\u00e9guin said. All the while, parents have data in real-time so they can see how their kid is progressing. </p>\n<p>If this technology sounds similar to an enterprise task tracker (minus the free time reward at the end), it\u2019s because S\u00e9guin originally got the idea for Brili as an agile software product owner. </p>\n<p>\u201cI had designed screens in the office that showed all of our projects, how complete they were, and the time remaining to completion,\u201d he said. \u201cI realized that I could leverage this technology for kids.\u201d</p>\n<p>Building from its initial cloud-computing model and again taking a hint from the enterprise, Brili has AI integration on its roadmap using IBM Watson. </p>\n<p>The company is currently planning a system that uses AI to analyze kid-level data to deliver recommendations and pattern analysis to parents. </p>\n<p>\u201cWatson could look into task completion rates, routine patterns, and other factors,\u201d said S\u00e9guin. \u201cThe plan is to not only help parents paint a full picture of their child\u2019s progress, but also predict the inputs that will lead to the highest success. This could mean a shift in the sequence of tasks, offering more time for a certain type of activity, etc.\u201d </p>\n<h3> Growth prospects</h3>\n<p>Brili\u2019s current mission is to remain focused on child health enablement. Once the underlying technology is more predictive, however, S\u00e9guin sees a variety of applications for the platform. </p>\n<p>\u201cADHD in particular is very heritable,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means if we are helping a kid with ADHD, it\u2019s highly likely that the parent also has ADHD.\u201d </p>\n<p>S\u00e9guin says the company is looking at how its platform can extend to help adults with things like meeting agenda management, or helping seniors who need to be monitored throughout their daily tasks for health reasons. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe technology itself has a lot of applications, but we don\u2019t want to spread ourselves too thin,\u201d said S\u00e9guin. \u201cWe want to dedicate resources to helping children right now, and do that right so kids with learning disabilities gain the confidence they need to succeed.</p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/tech-for-good-brili-applies-enterprise-tech-to-child-psychology/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Salesforce wants to invest $2 billion towards growing its business in Canada</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/salesforce-wants-to-invest-2-billion-towards-growing-its-business-in-canada/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/salesforce-wants-to-invest-2-billion-towards-growing-its-business-in-canada/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2018 19:53:49 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[funding]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[saas]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=129027</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Salesforce has announced that it&#8217;s investing $2 billion over five years towards growing its business in Canada.

Salesforce said that its employees in Canada are also committing to volunteer 45,000 hours in their local communities in 2018. </p>\n<p>Salesforce made a point to highlight its social good efforts: in 2017, Salesforce employees volunteered more than 34,000 hours in 2017 with local non-profits.

Coinsquare said that it&#8217;s raised a total of $47.3 million at equity valuations increasing from $30 million to $430 million. </p>\n<p>&#8220;We have seen tremendous investor confidence in the Coinsquare business model, having raised a total of $47.3 million in just over four months \u2013 notable for this industry,&#8221; said Cole Diamond, CEO of Coinsquare. &#8220;We take a very different view than your typical digital currency trading platform. Virgile Rostand, Coinsquare&#8217;s founder, was an early industry pioneer and blue-chip banking industry veteran. He built a custom platform that is unrivaled in Canada, boasting extremely high security standards.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ken Tsang, an investment banking veteran with a background at BMO, Bank of Canada, and McKinsey, has taken on the role of chief financial officer.

Here\u2019s the latest on these company updates.</p>\n<h3>Hardbacon launches iOS app</h3>\n<p>Montreal-based financial literacy startup Hardbacon has launched its iOS app hoping to become the &#8220;Netflix for investment&#8221; in Canada. </p>\n<p>Compatible with at least a dozen online brokers like BMO InvestorLine and TD Direct Investing, the app is designed to help users monitor their investments and obtain real-time analysis of their stock market portfolios. The company gets its data from Thomson Reuters, and integrates with brokers through its partner, Wealthica. </p>\n<p>\u201cMillennials want the freedom to invest in what speaks most to them,&#8221; said Julien Brault, Hardbacon\u2019s CEO. \u201cEveryone else in the finance industry offers something akin to cable, whereas we offer something similar to Netflix: a mobile app for $5 per month that provides access to all the tools and financial data that an investor needs to succeed in the stock market.\u201d</p>\n<p>The company also added Fran\u00e7ois Barri\u00e8re, former SVP and treasurer of Laurentian Bank, to its advisory committee. \u201cThe Hardbacon application fills a gaping need in the market, said the former banker. It helps people understand their own finances and how to invest in the stock market, but unlike what is prevalent in the industry, Hardbacon doesn\u2019t make any money from pushing financial products,\u201d he said. </p>\n<p>Hardbacon raised $70,000 <a href=\"https://betakit.com/with-50000-in-crowdfunding-hardbacon-hopes-to-make-the-average-canadian-a-stock-market-pro/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">from a crowdfunding campaign</a> launched last year, offering a financial literacy course to make everyone a &#8220;stock market pro.&#8221; It also received a contribution of $14,000 from BMO Smartfolio.</p>\n<h3>Payment Source partners with Paytm Canada</h3>\n<p>Paytm Canada, a payments and financial services company offering mobile payments and commerce, has partnered with Toronto-based alternative payments provider Payment Source. </p>\n<p>Canadians can now walk into any of the 6,000 Canada Post locations and directly deposit cash into their Paytm app without incurring any transaction costs. The goal is to allow Paytm Canada to provide a convenient solution for bill payments.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are very excited to partner with Payment Source to add the Canada Post network to our platform, and to open doors to Canadians who otherwise would not be able to add cash to their Paytm account,\u201d said Harinder Takhar, CEO of Paytm Labs. \u201cPaytm Canada is tenaciously revolutionizing the bill payment experience to provide all Canadians a seamless, instant and cost- free mobile account to manage their bill payments.\u201d</p>\n<p>Paytm \u2014 India&#8217;s largest mobile payments provider with over 200 million users \u2014 first entered the Canadian market <a href=\"https://betakit.com/indias-largest-mobile-payments-platform-launches-in-canada/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in March 2017</a>.

The company also received a $500,000 repayable contribution from the Canadian government through the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency&#8217;s (ACOA) Business Development Program. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe second wave of financing in the last quarter of 2017 and into early 2018 confirms the confidence of our investors in the company\u2019s strategy to bring to market new anti-infective drugs for resistant or neglected infections,\u201d said Kevin Sullivan, CEO of Appili Therapeutics. </p>\n<p>The funding will be used for operations and the continued growth of the company. Specifically, the additional funding will enable Appili to expand its pipeline of drugs fighting infectious diseases with additional in-licensed assets. The company last raised a round of funding <a href=\"https://betakit.com/funding-appili-finnai-goldmoney-askuity-odx/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in October 2017</a>, when it raised $3.1 million to fund clinical trials. That round also included participation from Innovacorp. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe government of Canada is pleased to continue its support of Appili Therapeutics as it expands its portfolio and business, creating more opportunities for export and foreign investment. Appili is contributing to the global community\u2019s search for solutions to combat antibiotic resistance and is a valued member of Canada\u2019s life sciences industry,\u201d said Andy Fillmore, parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Democratic Institutions and MP for Halifax. </p>\n<p><em>Photo via <a href=\"http://thechronicleherald.ca/business/1367280-appili-therapeutics-inc.-receives-more-than-3m-in-funding-for-c.-difficile-antibiot\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chronicle Herald</a></em></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/halifax-based-appili-therapeutics-raises-4-3-million-to-develop-solutions-for-antibiotic-resistance/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>iComplyICO raises angel investment from Uber founding team member</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/icomplyico-raises-angel-investment-from-uber-founding-team-member/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/icomplyico-raises-angel-investment-from-uber-founding-team-member/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2018 17:20:27 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[calgary]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FinTech]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[saas]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=128841</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Vancouver-based iComplyICO, which offers a platform automating compliance procedures for initial coin offerings (ICOs) and other digitized assets, has received an angel investment from...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>Vancouver-based <a href=\"https://icomplyico.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">iComplyICO</a>, which offers a platform automating compliance procedures for initial coin offerings (ICOs) and other digitized assets, has received an angel investment from Conrad Whelan, a member of the founding team of Uber. </p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Similar to Uber\u2019s situation, ICOs have not been historically regulated, leading to a wild-west situation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>A Calgary native, Whelan joined Uber in 2010 and acted as engineering manager. He was the company&#8217;s first full-time engineer, and focused on building teams for Uber related to analytics infrastructure and international product development.</p>\n<p>The company also announced that PlentyOfFish&#8217;s lead web developer, Matt Masiar, will now act as its CTO.</p>\n<p>\u201cICOs and cryptocurrencies are creating amazing opportunities to fund companies in new and interesting ways, but there is still a need for ensuring that stakeholders are treated fairly and honestly with this new kind of fundraising,\u201d said Whelan.</p>\n<p>Whelan got his start in a space that was not subject to regulations of its time \u2014 similar to the crypto space today. Regulators in Canada have been cautious of the space, with Canadian Securities Administrators <a href=\"https://betakit.com/canadian-securities-administrators-says-icos-must-consider-securities-laws/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">putting out a statement</a> reminding FinTechs to consider securities laws and work with regulatory sandboxes to ensure they complied. Kik notably <a href=\"https://betakit.com/kik-excluding-canadians-from-kin-token-distribution-event/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">excluded Canada from its ICO</a> event due to frustration with regulation.  </p>\n<p>\u201cSimilar to Uber\u2019s situation, ICOs have not been historically regulated, leading to a wild-west situation for investors and issuers alike,&#8221; said Matthew Unger, founder and CEO of iComplyICO. &#8220;However, governments are now beginning to adapt to innovation, developing regulations, and are testing the technology. This is going to impact how ICOs are launched, governed, investigated and how regulations are enforced, this is where iComplyICO comes in.\u201d</p>\n<p>iComplyICO is a blockchain-agnostic solution focusing solely on software for compliance and secondary trading. It offers no consulting, token development, or proprietary token environments.</p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/icomplyico-raises-angel-investment-from-uber-founding-team-member/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Today in key hires: Wiivv announces new VP, Smooth Commerce adds former CFL SVP to team</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/today-in-key-hires-wiivv-announces-new-vp-smooth-commerce-adds-former-cfl-svp-to-team/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/today-in-key-hires-wiivv-announces-new-vp-smooth-commerce-adds-former-cfl-svp-to-team/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2018 14:38:14 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FinTech]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[retail]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[vancouver]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[wearables]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=128863</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Today, two companies announced major additions to their team.

Here&#8217;s the latest update on who&#8217;s added to their team.</p>\n<h3>Former CFL vice president Glen Johnson joins Smooth Commerce as chief commercial officer</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://smoothcommerce.tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Smooth Commerce</a>, a mobile order and payment solution for retail verticals, has added Glen Johnson as its chief commercial officer.</p>\n<p>Johnson has a 30-year career in technology, financial services, and professional sports; he was most recently SVP at the Canadian Football League. In the past, he&#8217;s acted as SVP of product ventures at Intelliware Development, and has held senior leadership roles at Manulife Financial, GE Capital, and Deloitte Consulting. As chief commercial officer, Johnson will be developing the company&#8217;s partnerships, market expansion, and product management.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to welcome Glen to our growing team,\u201d said Brian Deck, CEO of Smooth Commerce. \u201cWith a track record of delivering solutions and developing strategic relationships with organizations such as Shoppers Drug Mart, the NFL, Rogers, ADP, RBC, and others, Glen brings to the table a level of expertise and deep connections to the industry that will complement our leadership team.\u201d</p>\n<p>Smooth Commerce&#8217;s platform allows merchants to build native mobile apps, including order-ahead features, loyalty rewards, offers, and personalized promotions. In November 2017, the company <a href=\"https://betakit.com/smooth-commerce-raises-2-million-to-help-retailers-embrace-mobile/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">raised $2 million</a>, partly to build out its team.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter leading and implementing key process and technology changes in Football Ops at the CFL, it\u2019s great to be back on the services side,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cI\u2019m so pleased to join the leadership group at Smooth Commerce, along with its talented team and world class Board of Directors to deliver solutions in the evolving Fintech space.

Venture Studios will launch with four industry vertical programs in financial services, automotive, media, and travel and hospitality.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The executives behind Venture Studios will donate five percent of the profits to diversity and charity causes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWe built this platform from the ground-up based on our entrepreneurial experience and corporate rolodexes. All great entrepreneurs should have access to this &#8211; we are flipping the model and unfairly stacking the deck in their favor,\u201d said Sheetal Jaitly, CEO of TribalScale. \u201cVenture Studios supercharges the best ideas, gets them, captive customers, early, and takes them globally from day one.\u201d</p>\n<p>The company has been working on developing the program over the past year. Kirstine Stewart, who <a href=\"https://betakit.com/kirstine-stewart-joining-tribalscale-as-president-and-chief-revenue-officer/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recently joined the team as president and chief revenue officer</a>, said that the company&#8217;s developments in the voice and AI space in Venture Studios are part of what brought her to the company. </p>\n<p>\u201cVenture Studios has assembled a strong team made up of entrepreneurs, executives, and technologists,\u201d said Stewart. \u201cCollectively our team has invested in or sat on the boards of dozens of startups over the past twenty years, achieving many successful exits. This team has \u2018been there and done that\u2019 and are experts in conceiving, building, and scaling disruptive digital ideas.\u201d</p>\n<p>TribalScale has partnered and worked with early-stage entrepreneurs on their ideas through Venture Studios, including Vouchr, AskTheDoctor, and WorkTango, which are leveraging the TribalScale platform. This year, the company expanded its focus to include ideation and scaling of startups, including Decibal, an AI and voice-based platform, and Every Financial, which offers a bank account for small business.</p>\n<blockquote><p>TribalScale will be offering startups $500,000 in cash and support to accepted companies.<br />\n&nbsp;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>TribalScale will be offering startups $500,000 in cash and support to accepted companies, with follow-on capital for promising startups. According to <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/tribalscale-launches-new-venture-studio-program/article37880755/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Globe and Mail</a>, over 14 weeks, startups will help entrepreneurs from the ideas phase to development of MVP in exchange for equity decided on a case-by-case basis. The studio is looking for both early-stage companies and entrepreneurs with strong ideas. </p>\n<p>\u201cOver the past decade, enterprises have invested heavily in corporate innovation labs. The question is, where should the next hundreds of billions of dollars of budgets be spent to level up enterprise innovation output? We believe the next model for innovation labs should leverage innovation from both inside and outside of an enterprise,&#8221; said Roger Chabra, chief innovation officer of TribalScale.  &#8220;To truly achieve innovation DNA within their ranks, enterprises need to leverage the smarts and hustle of great entrepreneurs, and they need strong platforms and processes from partners like TribalScale. That is what Venture Studios is all about.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The executives behind Venture Studios will donate five percent of the profits to diversity and charity causes. Its first partners are Move The Dial and the Upside Foundation.</p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/tribalscale-launches-100-million-venture-studios-program-to-co-create-ai-and-blockchain-startups/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Rubikloud hiring 60 people in Toronto to meet global demand for its service</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/rubikloud-hiring-60-people-in-toronto-to-meet-global-demand-for-its-service/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/rubikloud-hiring-60-people-in-toronto-to-meet-global-demand-for-its-service/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2018 14:00:35 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[AI]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[retail]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=128827</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Rubikloud is adding another 60 people to its Toronto office.

Rubikloud is in the business of helping retailers migrate legacy data onto the cloud, and using that data to automate decision-making on promotions across stores, loyalty marketing, and mass promotional planning. With Intel as the lead, the hope was to leverage its sensor-level data to get more insight on what&#8217;s happening in stores in real-time. </p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The core tech scene in the city is not large scale enterprise deployments. We&#8217;re excited about being that company here.&#8221;<br />\n&#8211; Kerry Liu\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThe state of the enterprise AI market is nascent, with few companies deploying AI solutions to businesses,\u201d said Kerry Liu, CEO of Rubikloud. \u201cRubikloud\u2019s product and platform are ahead of the market, offering tech talent practical AI careers where they can actually build AI applications. We\u2019ve seen a recruiting upticks as analysts and shareholders actively ask companies how they are using AI and ML to improve their bottom lines. Our clients are not funding research projects. They are funding automated production systems.\u201d</p>\n<p>The company is adding junior to senior executive positions in data science, engineering, sales, operations, finance, and marketing to meet the demand for its growing customer base. In an interview with BetaKit following Rubikloud&#8217;s Series B, Liu indicated that a big part of the funding would go to meeting this demand, as the company is dealing with large volumes of data.  </p>\n<p>&#8220;We have more committed customers than we can deploy \u2014 a lot of them happen to be in Europe and Asia,&#8221; said Liu at the time. &#8220;A big part of this is expansion or deployment and delivery. And we have a one to two-year window to exponentially explode as a company.&#8221; </p>\n<p>The company said it is hoping to launch offices in London and Hong Kong. Since launching in 2013, Rubikloud has grown to more than 75 employees today, and signed on <a href=\"https://betakit.com/rubikloud-stresses-long-term-approach-to-securing-clients-following-partnership-with-international-beauty-retailer/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">partners like A.S. Watson Group</a>, Asia and Europe&#8217;s largest health and beauty retailer. In a BetaKit profile <a href=\"https://betakit.com/as-rubikloud-grows-to-100-ceo-kerry-liu-says-it-has-a-head-start-on-the-race-to-win-retail-cloud-computing/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a year ago</a>, Liu had plans to grow to 100 by the end of that year, and his excitement at growing an enterprise SaaS company from Toronto. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The core tech scene in the city is not large scale enterprise deployments,&#8221; said Liu, who says the city has had a rich history of winning this industry in companies like D2L and Quickplay Media. &#8220;We&#8217;re excited about being that company in Canada here, and if you&#8217;re interested in hundred-terabyte levels of data, deployed at very large companies and all of the business processes around multimillion-dollar software-as a-service sales, we want to be a home for that in Toronto.&#8221;</p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/rubikloud-hiring-60-people-in-toronto-to-meet-global-demand-for-its-service/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Element AI global talent report finds Canada has third-largest concentration of AI researchers</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/element-ai-global-ai-talent-report-finds-canada-has-third-largest-concentration-of-ai-researchers/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/element-ai-global-ai-talent-report-finds-canada-has-third-largest-concentration-of-ai-researchers/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2018 13:00:18 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[AI]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Montreal]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[report]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=128795</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Montreal-based Element AI has compiled a report and analysis on the global supply of AI researchers in an effort to get a better understanding...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>Montreal-based <a href=\"https://www.elementai.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Element AI</a> has compiled a report and analysis on the global supply of AI researchers in an effort to get a better understanding of an industry in high demand. </p>\n<p>Overall, the report found that there are 22,064 PhD-educated researchers globally that are capable of working in AI research and applications, with only 3,074 candidates currently looking for work. The US had the highest concentration of researchers with 9,010 researchers, followed by the UK with 1,861 researchers. </p>\n<p>Canada fell in third place with 1,154 researchers.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The US acts as the &#8216;hub&#8217; for AI research and education, serving as the link for both the academic and business worlds where AI intersects.\u201d </p></blockquote>\n<p>To conduct the broader survey, Element AI used results from LinkedIn searches that showed the total number of profiles according to specialized parameters. The search included candidates who were awarded a PhD no later than 2015 to account for years of work experience, and candidates must include &#8216;AI&#8217; as well as specific concepts such as deep learning. To ensure they had technical expertise, they included candidates with experience in Python, Tensorflow, or Theano.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Canada came in third place for the number of researchers in our LinkedIn and conference presenter searches, making it a viable competitor to the US, with 1,154 high-level profiles, which is high given Canada\u2019s small population and GDP,&#8221; the report reads.</p>\n<p>Canada has received a lot of attention for its AI ecosystem \u2013 Element AI itself <a href=\"https://betakit.com/element-ai-raises-137-5m-cad-series-a-with-plans-to-hire-100-people-in-toronto/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">raised a historic $137.5 million</a> Series A last year. Last year also saw a lot of attention for Canadian AI talent as several tech companies \u2014 such as Facebook, Google, Uber, Samsung, and DeepMind \u2014 set up AI labs in the country. </p>\n<p>To address a talent gap, the Canadian government <a href=\"https://betakit.com/budget2017-calls-for-950-million-towards-superclusters-national-ai-strategy/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pledged $125 million</a> in a national AI strategy. Part of that went to <a href=\"https://betakit.com/shopify-google-among-30-companies-committing-combined-80-million-over-10-years-to-vector-institute/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Toronto&#8217;s Vector Institute</a>, meant to be a hub between industry and academia in AI research. The Ontario government went on to invest $30 million to <a href=\"https://betakit.com/ontario-govt-investing-30-million-in-vector-institute-as-part-of-amazon-hq-bid/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">create more AI grads</a>. </p>\n<p>Element AI also ran a more advanced subset to capture candidates who listed very specific frameworks such as torch, caffe, and nltk, and avoid candidates using AI as a buzzword. The report captured the names of leading AI conference presenters considered influential experts in their respective fields of AI. It found 6,138 experts using this search, with 1,735 indicating that they are available for work. Of this group, 5,400 AI experts are publishing studies and presenting at AI conferences. </p>\n<p>After analyzing conference data, the report also gleaned some interesting insights: &#8220;[Candidates] \u2014 despite being educated in Canada, the UK, Germany, France, or China \u2014 were more likely to move to the USA for professional work,&#8221; the report reads. &#8220;These arcs suggest that the US acts as the &#8216;hub&#8217; for AI research and education, serving as the link for both the academic and business worlds where AI intersects.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Some database biases to consider are the fact that LinkedIn is a predominantly Western platform, as the report showed that European and Asian countries have significantly fewer researchers than the US, the UK, or Canada. Conferences were almost limited to several English-speaking conferences in the Western world. </p>\n<p>Access more context on the full report <a href=\"http://www.jfgagne.ai/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.

It also displays a map of nearby defibrillators while giving tips on how to use them.</p>\n<p>The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada says that just one in 10 people survive a cardiac arrest when it occurs outside of a hospital, and that victims can end up with brain damage or worse in just three minutes. </p>\n<p>The app is currently being tested in Kingston and Toronto, as well as various US cities. PulsePoint has thus far been a \u201cresounding success,\u201d reportedly increasing bystander CPR response to 60 percent. </p>\n<p>You can visit PulsePoint\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.pulsepoint.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">official website</a> to find out more info or download the app.</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://mobilesyrup.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MobileSyrup</a></em></p>\n<p><em>Photo via <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/q8U1YgBaRQk\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></em></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/bc-testing-app-to-help-victims-of-cardiac-arrest/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Subscribe to H&#124;T: The Healthtech Times Newsletter</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/subscribe-to-ht-the-healthtech-times-newsletter/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/subscribe-to-ht-the-healthtech-times-newsletter/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2018 14:30:04 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Douglas Soltys]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[healthtech]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=128097</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[As BetaKit expands the breadth and depth of its coverage, we&#8217;ve often chosen the hottest topics in tech: FinTech, AI, retail (yes, retail).

It&#8217;s rare we have the chance to choose a tech vertical that&#8217;s both hot and important.</p>\n<p>The data from 2017 shows that <a href=\"https://betakit.com/2017-shows-healthtech-funding-primed-to-grow-in-2018/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">healthtech funding</a> is primed to grow in 2018. That&#8217;s good news, because even investors believe that there&#8217;s currently a broad <a href=\"https://betakit.com/canadian-medtech-needs-more-early-stage-funding/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">lack of available capital</a> for early-stage healthtech companies in Canada.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When it comes to healthcare, we&#8217;re all users. And the problems startups solve are matters of life and death.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But why is that <em>important</em>? Because although all successful startups solve problems for their users, when it comes to healthcare, we&#8217;re all users, and the problems can often be matters of life and death. Healthtech companies are the ones helping hospitals track <a href=\"https://betakit.com/flosonics-raises-5-million-for-device-helping-hospitals-track-critically-ill-patients/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">critically-ill patients</a>, making healthcare more accessible by <a href=\"http://www.mediseen.ca/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">bringing back the house call</a>, making <a href=\"https://betakit.com/nicoya-lifesciences-raises-2-million-to-make-protein-testing-more-accessible/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">protein testing cheaper</a> for medical researchers, or helping patients <a href=\"https://betakit.com/medchart-eve-medical-part-of-healthtech-projects-funded-by-5-47-million-from-ontario/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">aggregate their medical records</a>. </p>\n<p>So BetaKit is happy to announce the launch of <a href=\"https://betakit.com/newsletters/ht-the-healthtech-times-newsletter/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">H|T: The Healthtech Times Newsletter</a>.

Here\u2019s the latest on these company updates.</p>\n<h3>WealthBar launches robo-advisor for independent advisors</h3>\n<p>Vancouver-based <a href=\"https://www.wealthbar.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WealthBar</a>, which provides low-cost investing options through diversified portfolios, financial planning tools, and an online investor dashboard, has launched a new robo-advising solution for independent financial advisors. </p>\n<p>The company partnered with national insurance marketing firm PPI to launch <a href=\"https://www.ppivalet.ca/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">PPI Valet</a>. The service allows advisors to ensure that they are compliant with regulations and reduce paperwork, while clients get 24/7 access to their investments. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis new and easy-to-use online platform will help independent advisors to do less paperwork and spend more time serving clients and growing their business,\u201d said Tea Nicola, CEO and co-founder of WealthBar. \u201cEvery advisor across the country can leverage the expertise of registered portfolio managers and the assurance of regulatory compliance, without needing to have that expertise in-house. We\u2019ll be covering all of that, so the advisors can deliver better value for their clients.\u201d</p>\n<h3>ATB Financial joins SecureKey&#8217;s Concierge service</h3>\n<p>Toronto-based <a href=\"https://securekey.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SecureKey</a>, an identity and authentication provider that works to provide users with easier access to online services and platforms, has signed on ATB Financial as a Trusted Sign-In Partner in the SecureKey Concierge service.</p>\n<p>SecureKey Concierge allows people to access online services using secure banking credentials they already have. The company&#8217;s overall mission is to build a verification network leveraging the security of government, telcos, and banks to <a href=\"https://betakit.com/with-ibm-partnership-securekey-enters-next-phase-of-developing-secure-digital-identity-network/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">expedite the process of authentication when accessing service</a>s. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe know our customers are going to appreciate the convenience of accessing government online services with SecureKey Concierge<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />,\u201d said ATB\u2019s chief transformation officer Wellington Holbrook. \u201cWe listened when our customers asked for a safe and secure login solution. They want to avoid having to remember additional account credentials or passwords that they often use just once a year. This is a great solution that fits with our goal of making banking work for people.\u201d</p>\n<p>SecureKey&#8217;s list of Sign-In Partners include BMO, CIBC, Choice Rewards MasterCard, Desjardins, National Bank, RBC Royal Bank, Scotiabank, Tangerine, TD, UNI Financial cooperation, L\u2019Alliance des Caisses populaires de l\u2019Ontario, and Affinity Credit Union.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are honoured to work with ATB Financial to play a role in the digital transformation in Alberta,\u201d said Greg Wolfond, founder and CEO of SecureKey. \u201cAt SecureKey, we are dedicated to providing easier access to online services for consumers across the country. This partnership demonstrates the value of using credentials that consumers already have and trust, and we are excited to partner with ATB Financial to continue bringing privacy-enhanced digital solutions to Canadians across the country.\u201d</p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/today-in-fintech-atb-financial-partners-with-securekey-wealthbar-launches-new-robo-advisor/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>CanCon Podcast Ep. 103: Are we breaking up with Facebook, or is Facebook breaking up with us?</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/cancon-podcast-ep-103-are-we-breaking-up-with-facebook-or-is-facebook-breaking-up-with-us/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/cancon-podcast-ep-103-are-we-breaking-up-with-facebook-or-is-facebook-breaking-up-with-us/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2018 00:25:32 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Douglas Soltys]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=128653</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[According to its latest quarterly financial results, Facebook has 2.2 billion monthly active users.

When one tech company can affect 1/4 of the world&#8217;s population with a single feature update or algorithm change, should it be able to without oversight? That&#8217;s a question we&#8217;re prompted to ask this week, as Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s Guilt Cleanse 2018<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> leads him to make sweeping changes to how the world experiences the modern &#8216;internet&#8217;. Here&#8217;s a bigger question we didn&#8217;t ask: do we need a bill of digital information rights?</p>\n<p>While you let that question decant for a few moments, we&#8217;re already on to another about Canada&#8217;s big fourth telecom that <em>isn&#8217;t</em>, Freedom Mobile. News of parent company Shaw&#8217;s dramatic buyouts and \u201ctotal business transformation initiative&#8221; has the CanCon podcast wondering if what we&#8217;re lamenting is A) the loss of a true Canadian tech competitor or B) just another seat at the oligopoly table.</p>\n<p>Finally, CanCon steps into the wayback machine to take us all back to January 2017. Across the country, one unified message rang out from Canadian tech: diversity is our strength.

The report included ranking tables for both cities and countries. </p>\n<p>Most of the data used while generating the rankings was accumulated on StartupBlink since its launch in 2014, or was sent to them by data partners in cities around the world. Besides startups, StartupBlink also takes into account coworking spaces, accelerators, tech reporters, and startup organizations.</p>\n<p>In the country rankings, the United States took the top spot, while the UK came in second. The report also pointed out that there is a large gap in the Americas, with the US and Canada at the top and third spot, while Mexico and Chile are 30 and 33rd. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Considering current trends, it is safe to assume that Canada might soon grab the second spot on the list,&#8221; the report reads on Canada&#8217;s ranking. &#8220;Canada does especially well on the quality of its startups considering its relatively low population. One of the most impressive facts about Canada is that unlike the UK, it has three major hubs all contributing to its strength: Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal.&#8221;</p>\n<p>By city, no Canadian city made the top 10 global ranking, with Toronto sitting at the 11th spot, with the next Canadian city, Vancouver, sitting at 19. Montreal made the 34th spot.  </p>\n<p>Access the full report <a href=\"https://www.startupblink.com/blog/startup-ecosystem-rankings-startupblink/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </p>\n<p><em>Photo via <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/OiQUrC4pgZc\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></em></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/report-ranks-canada-third-in-top-10-startup-ecosystems-worldwide/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>RBC&#8217;s Borealis AI boosts Toronto lab with two new senior researchers</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/rbcs-borealis-ai-boosts-toronto-lab-with-two-new-senior-researchers/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/rbcs-borealis-ai-boosts-toronto-lab-with-two-new-senior-researchers/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2018 17:04:34 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[AI]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=128561</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Borealis AI has added new senior researchers to its team.

Much of his research has focused on real-world applications for machine learning, which will help RBC in its mission to discover applications for financial services. Working with a team from Waterloo, Poupart will split his time between teaching and Borealis AI. His research specialties include the development of algorithms for reasoning under uncertainty and machine learning, with application to assistive technologies, natural language processing, and telecommunication networks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are thrilled to have Professor Poupart and Professor Brubaker continue their research as part of Borealis AI,\u201d said Foteini Agrafioti, chief science officer and head of Borealis AI. \u201cWe are at a tipping point in Canada \u2014 the AI ecosystem is poised to become the true and material world leader in AI. When top talent chooses to join a Canadian company, and stay in Canada, we all benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Brubaker will be overseeing Borealis AI\u2019s fundamental and applied research team in Toronto. His expertise in Bayesian machine learning, a set of methods for inferring things about the world in the presence of uncertainty, has previously led him to accelerate the discovery of molecular structures from cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM), a method for imaging frozen-hydrated specimens at cryogenic temperatures.

To recap, here are the main reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>About half of strategic sales fail to meet their objectives. In contrast, most PE deals succeed.</li>\n<li>If you have VCs that need an exit but you don\u2019t want to actually sell, replacing your VCs with a PE resets the clock. They get an exit. You keep your company.</li>\n<li>With a strategic sale, you have a boss. With a PE deal, while you have a highly active board, you are still in charge. Your company remains independent.</li>\n<li>PEs will work actively with you to build a company that you would likely not be able to build on your own. They do this by driving operational excellence and turning you into a buyer of companies.</li>\n<li>Since you retain significant upside and since your PE investors help you achieve a bigger outcome than you could alone, a PE sale gives you \u2018two bites at the apple\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200ayou get a partial exit today, but continue to hold a meaningful stake that should grow substantially before an ultimate exit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you buy my premise. Is your business right for a buyout? Let\u2019s look at that.</p>\n<p>Private equity firms come in many shapes and sizes and deploy various strategies for creating value. Some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n    <strong>Distressed situations:</strong> Buying distressed or turnaround companies at a deep discount, then installing a new team and working hard to get the company moving in the right direction.</li>\n<li><strong>Financial engineering:</strong> Using leverage to enhance returns and force operating efficiencies. Servicing this debt requires that management find ways to generate excess cash.</li>\n<li><strong>Roll-ups/ consolidation:</strong> Buy a first company that will become the &#8216;platform.&#8217; Then buy other companies to bolt on top. These companies may offer the same product or complementary products. If the same, then the strategy is basically to consolidate the market and migrate customers on to one platform. If complementary, then the strategy is to enable the company to cross-sell adjacent products in order to grow the value of each customer and provide that customer with a stickier, more complete solution.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These strategies are not mutually exclusive. A roll-up will likely make extensive use of debt as just one example.</p>\n<p>For the sake of simplicity, let&#8217;s set aside distressed situations. Chances are good that this is not the kind of exit that you\u2019re looking for.</p>\n<p>Financial engineering scenarios apply to companies that are already profitable. Not just on paper, but actually generating cash from operations. If you are still burning cash, then adding debt to your balance sheet is not going to help matters. You can\u2019t repay that debt without significant spending cuts.</p>\n<p>Roll-ups apply in scenarios where you have either lots of similar competitors or where there are many adjacent product possibilities. Endurance International is a great example of rolling up an industry. It was built through 80+ acquisitions of hosting companies. J2 and Paysimple are examples of companies that have bought complementary products to cross-sell. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nik-macmillan-280300-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"ask an investor\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-113749\" srcset=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nik-macmillan-280300-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nik-macmillan-280300-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nik-macmillan-280300-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nik-macmillan-280300-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nik-macmillan-280300-1-296x197.jpg 296w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nik-macmillan-280300-1-1050x700.jpg 1050w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nik-macmillan-280300-1-870x580.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" /></p>\n<h3>Is my business right for a buyout?</h3>\n<p>With the above overview in mind, here are some criteria that I look for in possible buyout candidates:</p>\n<p><strong>The business is beyond early stage:</strong> This implies a minimum of $5 million ARR. More likely, $10 million ARR and up. Achieving this scale usually results in a few things that are important for PE investors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are well past product-market fit</li>\n<li>You have clear, proven channels for customer acquisition</li>\n<li>You have proven unit economics</li>\n<li>You have likely assembled a strong senior leadership team</li>\n<li>There is sufficient operating history that an investor can examine lots of data in order to arrive at an investment decision. There will be few to no leaps of faith required.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Growth is good, but not great:</strong> If you\u2019re at $10 million plus ARR and still growing strongly (at least 75 percent, but more likely 100 percent), then you might be better served raising later stage venture versus private equity. These high-growth scale-ups tend to still be burning heavily, but because of their growth trade at high revenue multiples. The combination high burn and high valuation is not a fit for PE.</p>\n<p>If your growth is more modest, then your business will trade at a lower multiple, moving it into PE territory.</p>\n<p><strong>You (likely) sell to business:</strong> While there are some PE firms that do consumer (B2C) companies, the vast majority that I know look for business-to-business (B2B) companies.</p>\n<p>B2B is (generally) safer than B2C. The outcomes are less binary. The customers pay you directly. Enterprise value can be created in more predictable ways than B2C where you need huge scale (usually implying huge burn) and where the market leader takes all or most of the value in a category.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A great use case for PE is to invest in a fragmented market with many peers or many adjacent offerings. </p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Your business has been capital efficient:</strong> It is common for PE investors to come in to replace VCs. However, as a PE investor, I need management to have a lot of incentive to grow the business. If management owns a small amount then they may not have the motivation to go through the pain of swallowing debt or successfully bolting on acquisitions or making big improvements in operations.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more importantly, since as a PE investor I don\u2019t really like burn, if you burnt a lot of capital to get to this stage, will you be successful in a future where you can\u2019t burn?</p>\n<p>All of this has PE firms scouring the market looking for companies that have consumed little to no capital in order to achieve scale (and this means they\u2019re typically looking for B2B companies since it is almost impossible to achieve scale in B2C without a lot of capital).</p>\n<p>This quest is the reason why every growth stage CEO\u2019s inbox is regularly flooded with inbounds from analysts. They are always on the lookout for companies that have achieved a lot with a little.</p>\n<p><strong>Your industry is highly fragmented:</strong> This may not apply in every case, but a great use case for PE is to invest in a fragmented market with many peers or many adjacent offerings that can be rolled up or consolidated to create a large market leader.</p>\n<p><strong>You have a strong management team:</strong> Again, this may not apply in every case as a PE investor may install leadership, but having a proven management team in place already is often key. These are the people that work with their new majority investor to create value. In a roll-up situation especially, it is important to have strong parent company management that can execute acquisitions and integrate them to build a large, well-run company.</p>\n<p>When you put all of this together you create conditions that are ripe for PE: proven businesses, with reasonable valuations, strong management teams and a clear playbook for value creation. This is why PE investors expect to make money on every deal they do. Little is left to chance.</p>\n<p>If you are checking most of the boxes above, then PE may be a great fit for you and your business.</p>\n<p><em>Syndicated with permission from Mark MacLeod&#8217;s <a href=\"https://realexits.com/what-makes-a-good-buyout-target-633a2c52e492\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Real Exits</a> blog</em></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/ask-startupcfo-what-makes-a-good-buyout-target/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Montreal-based Leadweb wants to build a blockchain-focused supercluster</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/montreal-based-leadweb-wants-to-build-a-blockchain-focused-supercluster/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/montreal-based-leadweb-wants-to-build-a-blockchain-focused-supercluster/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2018 12:00:52 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Amie Watson]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FinTech]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Montreal]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=128503</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Montreal-based web and mobile app development company Leadweb is planning to go ahead with its proposed supercluster without government funding.

Leadweb proposed developing what it called a \u201cStrategic Intelligence\u201d supercluster with IBM, RBC, and other companies working in blockchain technology. </p>\n<p>Despite raising $112 million in commitments with collaborators, the proposal wasn\u2019t accepted, possibly due to not raising enough private funding to compete with the billion dollar commitments and amount of companies <a href=\"https://betakit.com/canadian-govt-announces-first-of-nine-shortlisted-superclusters-in-atlantic-region/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">involved in the winning proposals</a>, says Leadweb VP of Strategic Partnerships Andr\u00e9 Dupont-Moguel. </p>\n<p>Overseen by the government&#8217;s Innovation, Science and Economic Development department, the ISI\u2019s goal is to accelerate growth and business development in specific industries and business ecosystems. The government initiative will match funds raised by non-for-profit collaborative groups \u2013 the superclusters \u2013 made up of both public and private sector organizations, including research institutes and large, medium and small businesses. Winners are expected to be announced in early 2018.</p>\n<p>Most the ISI supercluster proposals were based in a single province or neighbouring provinces, and those shortlisted are spread throughout Canada. Two of nine shortlisted are based in Quebec, where one is focused on AI related to manufacturing, infrastructure, and retail, and the other is focused on mobility systems related to aerospace, ground transportation and advanced manufacturing. </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_128509\" style=\"max-width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Leadweb-Andre-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"leadweb\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\" class=\"size-large wp-image-128509\" srcset=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Leadweb-Andre-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Leadweb-Andre-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Leadweb-Andre-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Leadweb-Andre-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Leadweb-Andre-296x197.jpg 296w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Leadweb-Andre-1050x700.jpg 1050w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Leadweb-Andre-870x580.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Leadweb VP of Strategic Partnerships Andr\u00e9 Dupont-Moguel</p></div>\n<p>Unlike these, which propose building infrastructure for specific industries, Leadweb\u2019s supercluster proposal combined many industries working with blockchain, which Dupont-Moguel calls its own, new industry. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe objective was to build a full ecosystem around blockchain,\u201d he says. \u201cBlockchain pairs with IoT, big data and deep learning. The technologies leverage each other. We wouldn\u2019t get involved in a full IoT project unless there is blockchain involved, for example.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another difference between Leadweb\u2019s proposal and those shortlisted is that Leadweb\u2019s came with cash commitments from investors rather than companies. These funds would go towards blockchain training, talent acquisition, and the creation of new blockchain-based businesses instead of helping companies finance their own projects that they may have pursued anyway. \u201cThat type of strategy helps companies grow,\u201d said Dupont-Moguel. \u201cIn the end, it depends where the government thinks its investment will profit more the economy long term.\u201d</p>\n<p>RBC and IBM are still committed to working with Leadweb, says CEO Louis Cleroux, and the company\u2019s supercluster initiative will go ahead without federal funding. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe objective is to create the same thing with private money. Then if we do get government money later, it\u2019s just an extra step for the project,\u201d says Cleroux. </p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The ICO problem is that everybody\u2019s waiting for the SEC in the United States to make clear regulations. Canada doesn\u2019t like to jump before the SEC does.&#8221;<br />\n&nbsp;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thanks to the publicity Leadweb\u2019s supercluster proposal received, Cleroux says that government money might come sooner rather than later. More partners have signed on, and the company is now in discussions with other Quebec superclusters to start what he calls a \u2018mega supercluster.\u2019 </p>\n<p>Superlatives aside, Cleroux hopes this merger could also come with provincial funding. \u201cIt would make sense for Quebec because all the players are lined up and the projects are ready,\u201d he says, though he doesn\u2019t yet know how much money the province would or could offer.</p>\n<p>More private or public funding would also help Leadweb build a Montreal-based business accelerator to be called &#8220;The Blockchain Centre of Excellence,&#8221; for which the company would work to recruit global talent.</p>\n<p>Whether a merger of superclusters and an offer of provincial funding happens or not, Leadweb is still planning to launch its ExMachina Blockchain in early 2018, which is meant to be the basis for its supercluster ecosystem. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping for a three-month window to release the first version,\u201d said Cleroux. \u201cThis will be to convert money into tokens. For a full exchange \u2013 to trade money \u2013 we\u2019re looking at a six-month window.\u201d </p>\n<p>The ExMachina system will work to perform transactions quickly and in a fully decentralized way. \u201cThe current blockchain networks were simply too slow to execute that,\u201d says ExMachina Network lead developer Steve Rodrigue. \u201cWhen you have artificial intelligence, you need to process data, so I wanted to do that without having to host the data myself, because the goal is for people who put data on the blockchain to actually own the data.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rodrigue\u2019s solution involves smart applications where miners take on specialized roles to speed transactions. \u201cOn my blockchain, applications can connect to one another,\u201d he says. \u201cDuring our tests, we\u2019ve been able to scale up to one million transactions per second using 600 servers using proof of stake.\u201d </p>\n<p>He continues, \u201cThe application discovers which peers have more bandwidth and coins and ranks them. In a normal blockchain, it\u2019s one application that receives transactions, processes them, creates the block, verifies the block, and stores the block. But I disconnected each part, so it\u2019s possible to host only the part that you actually want to do. If you have a lot of bandwidth, you would aggregate all transactions. If you have processing power, you\u2019ll be a verifier.\u201d</p>\n<p>Once the blockchain is built, the supercluster will start with just one project: a digital assets wallet with AI capabilities and M2M transactions, says Dupont-Moguel. &#8220;Machines will have their own wallets and be able to trade to other machines and execute their work faster and more efficiently.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Like other blockchains, Leadweb\u2019s ExMachina Network will require a token system to pay miners to process information. For this, the company is planning to launch an ICO in early 2018, though it\u2019s waiting to see what precedent US government regulators set with regards to ICOs before launch. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re working with Canadian regulators to get the necessary permissions,\u201d says Leadweb strategy consultant Eamon Leonard. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty open to this. The ICO problem is that everybody\u2019s waiting for the SEC in the United States to make clear regulations. Canada doesn\u2019t like to jump before the SEC does. But for applications like a cryptowallet, regulations are clearer.\u201d </p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/montreal-based-leadweb-wants-to-build-a-blockchain-focused-supercluster/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Canadian startup news of the week (02/04/18)</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/canadian-startup-news-of-the-week-02-04-18/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/canadian-startup-news-of-the-week-02-04-18/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 04 Feb 2018 21:04:43 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Amira Zubairi]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=128481</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Welcome to BetaKit&#8217;s startup stories of the week!

evolving into a smartwatch that\u2019s great for notifications and fitness tracking, whether the company wants it to or not. </p>\n<p>Just like Twitter, Amazon, and Google Maps, Slack has now killed off its Apple Watch app. The business-focused chat platform quietly announced the news in the notes for a recent update to its iOS app. </p>\n<p>That said, Slack states that users will still be able to respond to incoming messages thanks to the Apple Watch\u2019s notification features. However, the ability to view unread messages is going away. </p>\n<p>Some may not even notice the change, but if you\u2019re like me and enjoy being able to reply to private Slack messages directly from your wrist, the change will be disappointing. </p>\n<p>Back when Twitter ditched support for the Apple Watch, the social network stated that \u201cnotifications were the most helpful part of the Apple Watch experience.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/02/02/slack-ditches-apple-watch-ap/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MobileSyrup</a></em></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/slack-kills-its-apple-watch-app/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Ask a Developer: What are the benefits of using CI/CD?</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/ask-a-developer-what-are-the-benefits-of-using-ci-cd/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/ask-a-developer-what-are-the-benefits-of-using-ci-cd/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2018 20:47:39 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrew Leung]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ask a Developer]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[dev]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=128269</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Welcome to a new BetaKit bi-weekly series designed to help startup developers.

Each article, <a href=\"http://www.tribalscale.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TribalScale</a>\u2019s tech honchos tackle the tough questions facing devs today. Have a question you would like answered? Tweet them with the #askadeveloper hashtag, or email them <a href=\"mailto:contact@tribalscale.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<hr width=\"20%\" />\n<p>Continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) are second nature practices to some developers. However, there are still many who aren\u2019t implementing CI/CD into their development cadence. If you\u2019re already practicing, this is a helpful reminder of its many benefits. If you\u2019re trying to get your team on board, we\u2019ve done the work for you. If you haven\u2019t implemented CI/CD into your cycle, here is why you better start. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Productive developers are happy developers, and happy developers produce better product.<br />\n&nbsp;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Continuous integration is the process of automatically integrating code into your product. Code (potentially from a variety of sources) is integrated into a central repository for testing and building. Once the developers have committed their code changes to a central repository, CI will run your tests automatically every single time, giving you constant feedback on whether the code is working as intended. </p>\n<p>Continuous deployment or continuous delivery is the process that allows your product to be released faster and frequently. The code changes are delivered in shorter cycles, and made available to users, and yet again provide more frequent feedback!</p>\n<h2>How does CI/CD fit into the workcycle?</h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s imagine a developer that doesn\u2019t practice CI/CD&#8230;</p>\n<p>They run through their deployment cycle: pick the story to work on, code it, possibly write a unit test, run the test, ensure the code passes on their local computer, complete the story, and commit the code into the repository. Most likely, this cycle takes place multiple times a day.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_128289\" style=\"max-width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-01-at-12.09.40-PM.png\"><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-01-at-12.09.40-PM-1024x309.png\" alt=\"ask a developer\" width=\"690\" height=\"208\" class=\"size-large wp-image-128289\" srcset=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-01-at-12.09.40-PM-1024x309.png 1024w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-01-at-12.09.40-PM-300x91.png 300w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-01-at-12.09.40-PM-768x232.png 768w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-01-at-12.09.40-PM-600x181.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Click to enlarge.</p></div>\n<p>To produce a deliverable, the entire codebase is compiled manually and locally on their computer, meaning there is a lot of room for error. The process is also tedious, can take up a significant amount of time, and isn\u2019t a scalable option. This method requires intricate computer settings, and only the developers on that project will be familiar with the particular setup. So, if there is a new team member, they will need to mimic and understand the environment in order to produce the same output. And setting up a new development environment, learning the processes, and contributing code can take days. </p>\n<p>CI and CD automate this process. With CI/CD, the team will have a standard, shared environment, team members can continuously integrate code changes, and incrementally build on the product. In the end, the output is shared. Have a new team member? They can jump right in, and deploy on their first day by relying on the CI/CD pipeline.</p>\n<h2>Benefits and Advantages</h2>\n<h5>If you\u2019re a product owner&#8230;</h5>\n<p>You want your developers to integrate CI and CD into their practice because you will get results, and you will get them often. Deployments are ongoing, so you will be able to track the project and provide feedback at each stage, seek realignment, and adjust with the team as needed. In the end, because of regular review and oversight, you will feel even more confident in your product, especially as it gets closer to the end-users. </p>\n<h5>Do you have a developer team?</h5>\n<p>You want your teams practicing CI/CD. One, with much of the process automated, development is streamlined and developers will be more productive because they won\u2019t have to worry about the more tedious and mundane tasks. Two, the delivery cycle is shortened, so your teams will be producing and releasing that much faster. Three, onboarding and scaling for growth are much smoother with CI and CD.</p>\n<p>With improvements and increased output on the table, it just makes sense to integrate CI and CD. But rest assured, many CI/CD services are free (<a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Travis CI</a> and <a href=\"https://concourse.ci/index.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Concourse CI</a>), and the initial pipeline setup is usually fairly straightforward.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/OqtafYT5kTw\"><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ilya-pavlov-87438-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"coding\" width=\"690\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-128293\" srcset=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ilya-pavlov-87438-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ilya-pavlov-87438-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ilya-pavlov-87438-768x513.jpg 768w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ilya-pavlov-87438-600x401.jpg 600w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ilya-pavlov-87438-296x197.jpg 296w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ilya-pavlov-87438-1050x700.jpg 1050w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ilya-pavlov-87438-869x580.jpg 869w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" /></a></p>\n<h5>For developers&#8230;</h5>\n<p>Not only will your output increase, but your quality of life will improve. With much of the development cycle automated, you will be more efficient, and you won\u2019t have to worry about the little things. You can focus on doing what you love doing: writing the best code possible. </p>\n<p>The CI pipeline also provides feedback early and frequently in the development cycle. You will know whether something went wrong well before deployment, and you will have ample time to make the changes to clean your code. By the time the product is with the user, you can be sure that the code is strong. Another major benefit of fast feedback is that you will be able to iterate rapidly, make small changes, and see your efforts through deployment. There is nothing more gratifying than seeing the fruits of your labour. </p>\n<p>Finally, CI provides you with additional support and the validation that you are producing quality product. Don\u2019t be afraid to push yourself and your work, let people see what you can do. </p>\n<h2>Getting started with continuous integration and deployment</h2>\n<p>As discussed, CI and CD will bring immense benefits to your development cycle; there is really no good reason not to do it. Since many services are free, and with readily available cloud-based options (<a href=\"https://circleci.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Circle CI</a> and <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Travis CI</a>) building and releasing quality software is easy. </p>\n<p>I suggest you set up your pipeline before a single line of code is written. From the get-go all code will be centrally integrated, tested, and deployed. Having the CI/CD pipeline defined and implemented from the beginning will save time in the future and you will reap major long-term rewards.</p>\n<h5>Get in the groove</h5>\n<p>Continuous integration and deployment are part of the Agile DNA: lean teams, constant iteration, rapid feedback, and growth are symbiotic with CI/CD. However, CI and CD do more than add business value. The benefits are numerous and apply to all stakeholders: product owners, developer teams, end-users, etc&#8230; </p>\n<p>As mentioned, automating the tedious and dry tasks will enhance developer productivity and developers will produce better work faster. Then, developers can focus their energy on what they love and know how to do best. Personally, I know there is nothing better than getting in the groove, zoning-in, and writing some pretty stellar code with confidence. CI and CD let me and my teams leverage our potential and develop the best products possible. </p>\n<p><em>Photo via <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/I--YyrXUphc\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></em></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/ask-a-developer-what-are-the-benefits-of-using-ci-cd/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Techstars announces first cohort for Toronto accelerator</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/techstars-announces-first-cohort-for-toronto-accelerator/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/techstars-announces-first-cohort-for-toronto-accelerator/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2018 20:01:24 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[accelerator]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=128391</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Techstars has announced the first cohort of companies accepted into its accelerator in Toronto.

Startups hail from the Netherlands, Ukraine, China and the US.</p>\n<p>Announced in March 2017, Techstars chose Toronto as <a href=\"https://betakit.com/techstars-launches-first-canadian-accelerator-in-toronto/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">its first Canadian accelerator</a>, with Real Ventures as a partner. Techstars later <a href=\"https://betakit.com/techstars-toronto-announces-managing-director-ability-to-grant-startup-visas/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced that Sunil Sharma</a> would take the helm as managing director of the accelerator, and that the accelerator has the ability to grant startup visas.

For a few seconds, he says, he secretly turned on smartphone cameras across the planet, then compiled the data: \u201cBoom. A limitless resource of vocal and facial interaction.\u201d</p>\n<p>Turns out this is hardly sci-fi. As AI grows more sophisticated, developers have recognized that the information, images and videos we voluntarily share on social media and the internet represent one of the richest sources of raw data available\u200a\u2014\u200aa veritable snapshot of humanity at any given moment.</p>\n<p>Data like this, including the billions of messages sent across my platform, may one day be the lifeblood of machine learning\u200a\u2014\u200aan application of AI whereby machines, given access to enough data, learn for themselves. To \u201clearn,\u201d these tools typically need access to a vast training set. Often, it\u2019s only after analyzing how an improbably large collection of humans have handled a repetitive behavior (like playing Go or responding to customer service requests or tagging a photo of a dog with the word \u201cdog\u201d) that humans can be cut out of the process.</p>\n<p>Lots of this, of course, is old hat by now. Apple uses AI that\u2019s been trained on countless users to transcribe your voice and power Siri. Facebook uses AI that\u2019s learned from past interactions to ensure ads are properly targeted to billions of people. Google has incorporated AI, in some form, into its search engines from the very beginning.</p>\n<h3>The peril (and promise) of social data</h3>\n<p>But newer applications of AI, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/24/tay-microsofts-ai-chatbot-gets-a-crash-course-in-racism-from-twitter\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft\u2019s infamous Tay bot</a>, hint at the challenge of taking this social data at face value. A chatbot deployed on Twitter in early 2016, Tay was supposed to \u201clearn\u201d from user interactions. (\u201cThe more you talk, the smarter Tay gets,\u201d boasted her profile.) But she was beset with racist, anti-semitic and misogynistic commentary, almost from the start. Learning from her environment, Tay began spitting out a string of inflammatory responses, including, infamously, \u201cbush did 9/11, and Hitler would have done a better job than the monkey we have now.\u201d Microsoft developers pulled the plug a mere 16 hours after Tay\u2019s release.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In place of parents and priests, responsibility for this ethical education will increasingly rest on frontline developers and scientists.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a simple example. But herein lies the challenge. Yes, billions of people contribute their thoughts, feelings and experiences to social media every single day. But training an AI platform on social media data, with the intent to reproduce a \u201chuman\u201d experience, is fraught with risk. You could liken it to raising a baby on a steady diet of Fox News or CNN, with no input from its parents or social institutions. In either case, you might be breeding a monster.</p>\n<p>The reality is that while social data may well reflect the digital footprint we all leave, it\u2019s neither true to life nor necessarily always pretty. Some social posts reflect an aspirational self, perfected beyond human reach; others, veiled by anonymity, show an ugliness rarely seen \u201cin real life.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ultimately, social data\u200a\u2014\u200aalone\u200a\u2014\u200arepresents neither who we actually are nor who we should be. Deeper still, as useful as the social graph can be in providing a training set for AI, what\u2019s missing is a sense of ethics or a moral framework to evaluate all this data. From the spectrum of human experience shared on Twitter, Facebook, and other networks, which behaviors should be modeled and which should be avoided? Which actions are right and which are wrong? What\u2019s good \u2026 and what\u2019s evil?</p>\n<h3>Coding religion into AI</h3>\n<p>Grappling with how to build ethics into AI isn\u2019t necessarily a new problem. As early as the 1940s, Isaac Asimov was hard at work formulating his <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/why-asimovs-three-laws-of-robotics-cant-protect-us-1553665410\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Laws of Robotics</a>. (The first law: a robot may not harm a human being, or through inactivity allow a human to come to harm.) But these concerns aren\u2019t science fiction any longer. There\u2019s a pressing need to find a moral compass to direct the intelligent machines we\u2019re increasingly sharing our lives with. (This grows even more critical as <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/googles-learning-software-learns-to-write-learning-software/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AI begins to make its own AI</a>, without human guidance at all, as is already the case with Google\u2019s AutoML.) Today, Tay is a relatively harmless annoyance on Twitter. Tomorrow, she may well be devising strategy for our corporations&#8230;or our heads of state. What rules should she follow? Which should she flout?</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s where science comes up short. The answers can\u2019t be gleaned from any social data set. The best analytical tools won\u2019t surface them, no matter how large the sample size.</p>\n<p>But they just might be found in the Bible.</p>\n<p>And the Koran, the Torah, the Bhagavad Gita and the Buddhist Sutras. They\u2019re in the work of Aristotle, Plato, Confucius, Descartes, and other philosophers both ancient and modern. We\u2019ve spent literally thousands of years devising rules of human conduct\u200a\u2014\u200athe basic precepts that allow us (ideally) to get along and prosper together. The most powerful of these principles have survived millennia with little change, a testament to their utility and validity. More importantly, at their core, these schools of thought share some remarkably similar dictates about moral and ethical behavior\u200a\u2014\u200afrom the Golden Rule and the sacredness of life to the value of honesty and virtues of generosity.</p>\n<blockquote><p>AI, to be effective, needs an ethical underpinning. Data alone isn\u2019t enough. AI needs religion\u200a\u2014\u200aa code that doesn\u2019t change based on context or training set.<br />\n&nbsp;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>As AI grows in sophistication and application, we need, more than ever, a corresponding flourishing of religion, philosophy, and the humanities. In many ways, the promise\u200a\u2014\u200aor peril\u200a\u2014\u200aof this most cutting-edge of technologies is contingent on how effectively we apply some of the most timeless of wisdom. The approach doesn\u2019t have to, and shouldn\u2019t, be dogmatic or aligned with any one creed or philosophy. But AI, to be effective, needs an ethical underpinning. Data alone isn\u2019t enough. AI needs religion\u200a\u2014\u200aa code that doesn\u2019t change based on context or training set.</p>\n<p>In place of parents and priests, responsibility for this ethical education will increasingly rest on frontline developers and scientists. Ethics hasn\u2019t traditionally factored into the training of computer engineers\u200a\u2014\u200athis may have to change. Understanding hard science alone isn\u2019t enough when algorithms have moral implications. As emphasized by <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/why-well-eventually-want-our-robots-to-deceive-us-1819114004\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">leading AI researcher Will Bridewell</a>, it\u2019s critical that future developers are \u201caware of the ethical status of their work and understand the social implications of what they develop.\u201d He goes so far as to advocate study in Aristotle\u2019s ethics and Buddhist ethics so they can \u201cbetter track intuitions about moral and ethical behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p>On a deeper level, responsibility rests with the organizations that employ these developers, the industries they\u2019re part of, the governments that regulate those industries and\u200a\u2014\u200ain the end\u200a\u2014\u200aus. Right now, public policy and regulation on AI remains nascent, if not non-existent. But concerned groups are raising their voices. <a href=\"https://openai.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Open AI</a>\u200a\u2014\u200aformed by Elon Musk and Sam Altman\u200a\u2014\u200ais pushing for oversight. Tech leaders have come together in the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to explore ethical issues. Watchdogs like <a href=\"https://ainowinstitute.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AI Now</a> are popping up to identify bias and root it out. What they\u2019re all searching for, in one form or another, is an ethical framework to inform how AI converts data into decisions\u200a\u2014\u200ain a way that\u2019s fair, sustainable and representative of the best of humanity, not the worst.</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t a pipedream. If fact, it\u2019s eminently within reach. Sensational reports surfaced recently about Google\u2019s DeepMind AI growing \u201c<a href=\"https://qz.com/911843/googles-ai-got-highly-aggressive-when-competition-got-stressful-in-a-fruit-picking-game/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">highly aggressive</a>\u201d when left to its own devices. Researchers at Google had <a href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/papers/multi-agent-rl-in-ssd.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AI \u201cagents\u201d face off</a> in 40 million rounds of a fruit-gathering computer game. When apples grew scarce, the agents started attacking each other, killing off the competition\u200a\u2014\u200ahumanity\u2019s worst impulses echoed \u2026 or so the critics said.</p>\n<p>But then researchers switched up the context. Algorithms were deliberately tweaked to make cooperative behavior beneficial. In the end, it was those agents who learned to work together who triumphed. The lesson: AI can reflect the better angels of our nature, if we show it how.</p>\n<p><em>Syndicated with permission from Ryan Holmes&#8217; @invoker <a href=\"https://medium.com/@invoker/why-we-need-to-get-religious-about-ai-before-its-too-late-7496ef4ad224\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Medium account</a></em></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/hootsuites-ryan-holmes-we-need-to-get-religious-about-ai-before-its-too-late/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Miovision receives $1.5 million from Ontario gov&#8217;t to expand team</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/miovision-receives-1-5-million-from-ontario-govt-to-expand-team/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/miovision-receives-1-5-million-from-ontario-govt-to-expand-team/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2018 16:50:14 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[funding]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[govt]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iot]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Kitchener]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=128365</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The Ontario government is investing $1.5 million in Kitchener-based Miovision to help grow the company&#8217;s team.

Each week, investors tackle the tough questions facing founders today. Have a question you would like answered? Tweet them with the #askaninvestor hashtag, or email them <a href=\"mailto:askaninvestor@betakit.com\" target=\"_top\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<hr width=\"20%\" />\n<p>VCs give many reasons for passing on an investment. The best will tell you what they loved and what they ultimately couldn\u2019t wrap their heads around. The worst will simply leave you hanging. In between, there are a multitude of reasons, which is where yours falls \u2014 the VC is at the end of their investment period.</p>\n<p>Our predecessor, Katherine Homuth, mentioned activity <a href=\"https://betakit.com/ask-an-investor-how-do-i-perform-due-diligence-on-a-vc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">as one of the key insights</a> you should be looking to uncover on your VCs, highlighting that you should make sure the investors you\u2019re contacting have written a cheque in the last 12 months.</p>\n<p>This is great advice, but it misses a few nuances as you move up the investing chain from angel investors to institutional funds.</p>\n<p>First things first \u2014 what is an investment period?</p>\n<p>When institutional VCs raise a fund, they (as the fund GPs), typically agree to a 10-year lifetime with their investors (their LPs). This creates a commitment to return all capital within 10 years.* </p>\n<p>But here\u2019s the catch: GPs only make new investments for the first four years of that lifetime. When GPs are creating their portfolio construction, they\u2019ll plan to hold a certain amount of capital (often as much as 50 to 60 percent) as follow-on capital for portfolio companies, also known as &#8220;reserves.&#8221; </p>\n<blockquote><p>Investors have to look at their investments at a portfolio level, as well as based on their individual merits.<br />\n&nbsp;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>These reserves are distributed over the remainder of the fund lifecycle (disproportionately in years five to eight) and help VCs maximize their ownership in outperformers and avoid seeing their equity washed-out by subsequent term sheets with pay-to-play rounds. Reserve capital and new investment capital isn\u2019t interchangeable &#8211; a VC firm\u2019s returns are ultimately determined by their ability to allocate capital across their outperforming companies, so don\u2019t expect to be able to sway a VC to allocate a reserve dollar for your first funding round.</p>\n<p>If you aren\u2019t aware of these fundraising dynamics, it can be hard to understand where in a fund lifecycle a VC firm is. Investors will continue to announce their follow-on investments, and if you don\u2019t do your homework and understand who\u2019s in a VCs portfolio (and when they invested), it can seem like these are actually new investments.</p>\n<p>However, most VCs get into the business because they\u2019re energized by meeting new founders and making new investments. Because they can\u2019t make new investments in years five to 10, firms typically raise new funds every four years. </p>\n<p>This means they\u2019ll always have a firm writing cheques into new companies, and they\u2019ll maximize their opportunity to make new investments. Unfortunately, fund lifecycles don\u2019t always perfectly line up. Fundraising can take a bit longer than the GP anticipated, or they can see stronger dealflow than previously and invest their entire allocation in three years.</p>\n<p>Even when a fund has capital remaining for new investments, GPs will seriously evaluate their portfolio construction once they\u2019re halfway through the investment timeline to make sure they\u2019re on track.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you&#8217;re really looking for a way to work together, consider saving some space and delaying your close.<br />\n&nbsp;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Investors have to look at their investments at a portfolio level, as well as based on their individual merits. The GP will typically reflect on if the portfolio reflects their planned construction from a risk perspective, a stage perspective, and a performance perspective. They\u2019ll also consider market factors \u2014 like if they\u2019re seeing a dramatic increase in valuations or unexpected competition at a specific stage of investments. </p>\n<p>By year three, the fund is no longer a blank slate and the GP might no longer be looking for the best investment or a credible series A investment &#8211; they might be looking for the best series A investment they\u2019re likely to see in a two year period.</p>\n<p>So what should you think when a VC tells you they can\u2019t invest in your company because it doesn\u2019t align with their investment period? Ultimately, it\u2019s an honest answer and they\u2019re a strong lead to nurture for future investments. </p>\n<p>If they\u2019re towards the end of the fundraising process and you\u2019re really looking for a way to work together, consider saving some space and delaying your close (or holding a second close). Otherwise, stay in touch, prime them to invest in your next funding round, and ask them to provide glowing references to VCs they respect who can invest in your startup now.</p>\n<p>And in the future, do your diligence at the front-end of the investment conversation and ask your VCs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nWhat year of the fund are you on?</li>\n<li>\nHow much remaining capital do you have allocated for new investments?</li>\n<li>\nWhat stage do you want those investments to be?</li>\n<li>\nWhat sector do you want those investments to be?</li>\n<li>\nAre you staying in an investment role with the new fund?</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4> Christian&#8217;s take:</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/christianlassonde150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Christian Lassonde\" width=\"175\" height=\"175\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-50164\" /> </p>\n<p>The ideal time to raise money from a fund is early in their investment period, when they have the most flexibility with both sector, stage, and duration risk. However, hitting up funds in their sweet spot is like trying to market time your stock picking &#8211; it\u2019s all but impossible and generally will lead to suboptimal results. In other words, stick with the tried and true.</p>\n<p>Asking Sarah\u2019s questions after the initial meeting with a fund is generally a good time. After your initial pitch, some funds will ask whether you have any questions; this is the perfect time to bring these questions up. Funds will typically be open with their answers. If they are hedging or not giving you straight answers it&#8217;s likely they have bad news for you and just don\u2019t want to tell you.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of reasons and not all of them are necessarily bad news for you.</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> The current active fund has only a spot or two left open and you don\u2019t fit their needs for those slots &#8211; Sarah covered this above.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> A venture firm may have no active fund</p>\n<p>Their last fund\u2019s investment period is over, but they haven\u2019t closed their next fund. As Sarah pointed out, funds may reach the end of the investment period, and for whatever reason, the VCs didn\u2019t get their next fund up and running yet. They\u2019ll still be making follow-on investments, but can\u2019t write cheques to new companies. Unless they plan on winding down the fund (they aren&#8217;t), the fund managers are out fundraising like crazy while also seeing new businesses (like yours). These VCs have a strong incentive to find especially enticing deals.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> A firm may be in breach of its LPA</p>\n<p>Each fund has a bunch of rules, all bundled up in what\u2019s called a Limited Partnership Agreement (LPA). If a fund breaches one of those rules, one thing that happens is they can\u2019t invest any more money &#8211; until they fix the problem.</p>\n<p>One easier example is if a key partner leaves the firm. If that partner is considered a keyman in the LPA, a VC fund won\u2019t be allowed to invest any more money until they hire his or her replacement AND the limited partners agree that the new hire fixes the keyman provision. People move around in any business so this case is not entirely unheard of.</p>\n<p>Most venture funds are well run but breaches happen on occasion and it can often take months to get the Limited Partners to agree that it\u2019s been fixed.</p>\n<p>At first glance, a fund that can\u2019t invest may seem like bad news. However, if your company is a strategic fit for a fund, you may be a catalyst that helps rally the Limited Partners to agree to a first close or extend an investment period, as appropriate.</p>\n<p>Venture Funds rules can be complex, having advisors in your network who have some experience with them can help companies navigate those waters. Lastly, as always, open bi-lateral communication with your potential funding partners is critical and leads to good outcomes for all.</p>\n<p><em>*As an aside, real life exits don\u2019t perfectly map to pre-determined exit timelines, and VC funds don\u2019t immediately liquidate all their equity holdings on the last day of year 10.</em></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/ask-an-investor-how-do-i-handle-vcs-at-the-end-of-their-investment-period/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>SkyWatch raises $4 million to democratize satellite data</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/skywatch-raises-4-million-to-democratize-satellite-data/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/skywatch-raises-4-million-to-democratize-satellite-data/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 19:31:31 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[funding]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[saas]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[waterloo]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=128223</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Waterloo-based SkyWatch has raised $4 million to continue development of its aggregation and distribution platform for satellite data.

SkyWatch&#8217;s EarthCache platform allows companies to integrate Earth observation satellite data into their applications, while allowing satellite operators to distribute data to new and previously underserved markets. </p>\n<p>In October 2017, the company raised $50,000 from <a href=\"https://betakit.com/skywatch-and-ada-support-each-take-home-50000-at-communitech-rev-demo-day/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Communitech Rev Demo Day</a>. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Because Earth observation data has the potential to positively impact everyday life in so many ways, everyone should have the ability to easily incorporate this unique data type into their software applications. However, the barriers have been far too high, until now,&#8221; said James Slifierz, SkyWatch\u2019s CEO and co-founder. \u201cSkyWatch was started with this vision and we\u2019ve spent the past three years developing our platform alongside our early adopters. Satellite data integration into any software application is now as easy as payments integration via Stripe, or communications integration via Twilio. We\u2019re excited for the tremendous growth ahead, for both the company and the industry.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The company plans to use the funding for strategic hiring, accelerating product development, and building partnerships.

Leap</a> is trying to change that fuelled by a $1.8 million seed round. The company is trying to bring the best of both retail worlds together: the benefits of being able to see and touch the items in a brick-and-mortar location, and the ability to create more personalized experiences based on that customer\u2019s data. The company is backed by angel investors including Order of Canada recipients Haig Farris and Chen Fong.  </p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe future of shopping is very much this coherent connected environment. That will be true for at least five to seven years.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u201cMain street Canada and USA merchants are under incredible pressure.  Online retailers such as Amazon have deep data on each shopper, the tools to analyze that data and make intelligent personalized recommendations to each shopper, and finally a system to deliver those offers directly to each shopper,\u201d said Farris.  \u201cThe majority of main street merchants are frankly lucky to even have a handle on their own data let alone having the tools and system to take action. REXEIPT levels the playing field.\u201d</p>\n<p>Q.I. Leap has also launched its early adopter program, with just under 100 retail locations across Vancouver.</p>\n<p>The company is using the funding to commercialize its flagship product, REXEIPT, which it says provides \u201cAmazon parity data\u201d to retailers. REXEIPT includes an anonymized consumer-facing app that allows customers to track receipts and receive rewards in a loyalty program, while merchants can tie item-level purchases to shoppers, provide better offers, and get insight into ROI and inventory. The app is registration-free, meaning that shoppers don\u2019t need to give away personal information \u2014 an evolution from the process of collecting customer emails and sending offers that usually end up in spam folders. </p>\n<p>\u201cShoppers are traditionally identified with their smartphone, so what we did is that instead of getting the merchants to identify shopper, we get the shopper to identify the transaction. I don\u2019t need to know your name to do that,\u201d said Poya Haghnegahdar, CEO and co-founder of Q.I. Leap.</p>\n<p>Asked about the potential barrier to entry to main street businesses not interested in learning a new tech, Haghnegahdar notes that the platform means businesses don\u2019t launch a completely new loyalty program, replace their POS, or implement new training staff for new systems. </p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;With a very minimal piece of software, we change their existing POS systems and data communications divide.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThese things cost three to seven percent to the topline merchant,\u201d Haghnegahdar said of loyalty programs. \u201c[Our mandate was] we need to be able to do this in a way that most merchants can deploy it in minutes without undergoing a massive technological update, so what we worked hard on is that with their existing POS system, and very minimal piece of software, we change their existing POS systems and data communications divide.\u201d</p>\n<p>While just a few years ago the end of bricks-and-mortar was one of the hottest topics in tech, the same retail giants that were supposed to make physical stores obsolete are now <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/3112090/amazon-opens-lineup-free-grocery-store/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">opening physical stores themselves.</a> </p>\n<p>It may have been tempting to think of a future with no need to move beyond your smartphone, but Haghnegahdar predicts that this model is unsustainable. He\u2019s playing the long game, adding that over the next decade, more merchants will have more need of a platform like REXEIPT. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe future of shopping is very much this coherent connected environment where we as shoppers are check online because wealth of information that exists there unparalleled, but at the same time, we\u2019re creatures that like to touch certain things or see them up close and personal before we make that purpose,\u201d said Haghnegahdar. \u201cThat will be true for at least five to seven years. Exactly what type of items that will apply, I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell you.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Photo via <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@mercantile?utm_medium=referral&#038;utm_campaign=photographer-credit&#038;utm_content=creditBadge\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></em></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/q-i-leap-closes-1-8-million-seed-to-deliver-main-street-retailers-useful-data/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Hack To Start Ep.185: Joei Chan, content marketing manager at Mention</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/hack-to-start-ep-185-joei-chan-content-marketing-manager-at-mention/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/hack-to-start-ep-185-joei-chan-content-marketing-manager-at-mention/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 15:57:58 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Franco Varriano]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=128191</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Joei Chan is a content marketing manager at Mention, a platform for real-time media monitoring.

One of her clients wanted to make an introduction, but took 10 minutes to sift through a big binder to find the business card. Lapierre thought of all the data in that binder, and now works through tealbook to let procurement teams manage and discover suppliers on their own platform. </p>\n<p>Inspired by the idea of a &#8216;blackbook,&#8217; the name tealbook stuck with them. A year after development, Lapierre received a letter from Facebook challenging her name. &#8220;I became a trademark expert in a week,&#8221; Lapierre jokes, adding that an expensive law firm she hired advised her to sell the name to Facebook. She disagreed. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I called lawyer that I knew, that of a lawyer, lawyer, lawyer, and then I found Charlie,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He was a trademark expert at a tiny law firm, and he asks me one question a week after everyone telling me to change my name \u2014 he said, why do you need the trademark?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lapierre said she had to protect her brand, but Charlie countered she already had the URL, and nobody would take tealbook because Facebook would fight them too. Facebook never ended up filing a suit against tealbook, and the company successfully received their trademark. Lapierre noted that at the time, Facebook had 440 lawsuts against companies with &#8216;face&#8217; or &#8216;book&#8217; in their name.  </p>\n<p>&#8220;I think I know why you got your trademark,&#8221; Charlie said to Lapierre a week after tealbook received their trademark. The answer was in the fine print. </p>\n<p>Find out what she learned here:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vJn1bEwX5c0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><em>The next TechTO takes place on February 12.

In the crowded foodtech space, Platterz says its key differentiation is its predictive capabilities; keeping headcount in mind, the platform allows companies to receive personalized quotes and menus from local restaurants and caterers, eliminating the need for someone to manually calculate prices and personalize orders.   </p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Companies are spending so much time and effort trying to invest in their culture to attract and retain talent. We play a key part in this equation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThe approach that many companies are taking to feed their employees has a lot of room for improvement,\u201d said Eran Henig, co-founder and CEO of Platterz. \u201cOur clients love the experience of catering when powered by AI and predictive technology, and this is why we\u2019ve shown such tremendous growth since our launch. Aleph\u2019s data-driven approach to scaling businesses is the perfect strategic fit for us and we couldn\u2019t be more excited to have them join the Platterz family.\u201d</p>\n<p>Platterz also announced the addition of Jonathan Zabusky, former president of GrubHub and CEO of Seamless, and Ran Makavy, EVP of growth at Lyft and former director of product management at Facebook, as advisors to its board. The company emphasized the pair&#8217;s ecommerce and marketplace experience as Platterz looks to expand in North America and replace traditional service models. </p>\n<p>\u201cOur passion is all about helping companies build a strong and unique corporate culture by bringing teams and employees closer together. Companies are spending so much time and effort trying to invest in their culture to attract and retain talent. We play a key part in this equation,\u201d said Yishay Waxman, Platterz co-founder and president.</p>\n<p>In April 2017, Platterz <a href=\"https://betakit.com/with-6-7-million-seed-round-platterz-wants-to-dominate-corporate-catering-space-with-automation-focus/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">raised $6.7 million</a> to double down on its automation capabilities. </p>\n<p>At the time, the company was vocal about the stickiness of its family-style approach in a couple of ways. With a focus on local restaurants, Platterz allows smaller mom-and-pops to get the same visibility as larger chains with more budget. At the same time, the company&#8217;s philosophy is rooted in the idea of food  bringing people together \u2014 especially in tech companies, where culture often means getting meals but remaining glued to your screen. </p>\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019re social beings. Why can\u2019t we be that for at least one hour a day? A company should enforce that,&#8221; Henig said at the time.</p>\n<p>Platterz said it is currently serving &#8220;thousands&#8221; of employees in Toronto and New York City, and counts Shopify, Apple, and Salesforce among its customers. In 2017, Platterz said it tripled revenues and the grew the team to over 50 employees.</p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/platterz-raises-18-million-and-adds-former-grubhub-president-lyft-evp-to-advisory-board/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>OneEleven launches insurtech growth program with Aviva Canada</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/oneeleven-launches-insurtech-growth-program-with-aviva-canada/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/oneeleven-launches-insurtech-growth-program-with-aviva-canada/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2018 19:49:34 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[AI]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FinTech]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[saas]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=128069</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Toronto-based OneEleven has launched an insurtech growth program with insurance company Aviva Canada.

The fund plans to invest $25,000 in 24 student-run startups. The fund includes a team of 20 students from Montreal universities including McGill, Campus Montr\u00e9al (UdeM, HEC, Polytechnique), Concordia, and UQAM, ESG, and \u00c9TS.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is one of the top companies we\u2019ve seen out of McGill to date.

With the rise of ad-blockers and Google and Facebook&#8217;s duopoly on advertising, Pelcro hopes to provide an alternative.

The round also features continuing participation from White Star Capital, ff Venture Capital, and Portag3 Ventures. Portag3 and White Star Capital were part of Drop\u2019s <a href=\"https://betakit.com/drop-launches-in-the-us-with-5-5-million-from-sierra-ventures-portag3/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$5.5 million seed round</a> in October of last year.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a short time from seed to Series A, and the loyalty and rewards startup says the new round is one of the largest Series A rounds in Canadian FinTech history.</p>\n<p>Drop says its funding is fuelled by growth. Drop launched its platform \u2014 which allows users to link their credit or debit to the app, and earn points whenever they spend with Drop\u2019s merchant partners (including companies like Bloomingdales and Sephora) \u2014 in the US in October, quickly reaching a million users. The response from the company\u2019s target demographic, the elusive and desirable millennial customer, was similar to its beta launch in Canada.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe first launched in Canada and saw great growth and success (#2 in app store under Lifestyle). We then told ourselves that if the numbers in the US look as appealing from a cost, user engagement perspective, we would start focusing efforts down south,\u201d Drop founder Derrick Fung said at the time. \u201cWe hit number three in the US app store and consumers are just as \u2014 if not more \u2014 engaged with our product.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_127899\" style=\"max-width: 703px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/drop_ceo_engineer.png\" alt=\"Drop CEO Derrick Fung and Ian Logan\" width=\"693\" height=\"461\" class=\"size-full wp-image-127899\" srcset=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/drop_ceo_engineer.png 693w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/drop_ceo_engineer-300x200.png 300w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/drop_ceo_engineer-600x399.png 600w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/drop_ceo_engineer-296x197.png 296w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Drop CEO Derrick Fung (left) and Ian Logan.</p></div>\n<p>Drop says it will use the major cash injection to support a growth push in 2018. To aid that push, the company has pinched Ian Logan, former director of engineering at Airbnb, to lead its engineering team. A Canadian living in the Valley, Logan said the decision to repatriate was fuelled by Canada\u2019s potential as a global tech hub.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was inspired by the possibility of influencing the growing tech community in Canada,\u201d he said. &#8220;I saw the opportunity to cross-pollinate my own experience and knowledge in scaling companies. I wanted to make as big of an impact as possible in helping local innovation. I am now on a mission to contribute to Canada\u2019s startup ecosystem by helping make globally focused companies that are locally headquartered a success.\u201d</p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/drop-closes-25-8-million-series-a-repatriates-former-airbnb-exec/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Kirstine Stewart joining TribalScale as president and chief revenue officer</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/kirstine-stewart-joining-tribalscale-as-president-and-chief-revenue-officer/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/kirstine-stewart-joining-tribalscale-as-president-and-chief-revenue-officer/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2018 14:00:51 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=127847</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Toronto-based TribalScale has found its latest hire in Kirstine Stewart, who is joining the team as president and chief revenue officer.

At TribalScale, Stewart will focus on supporting TribalScale\u2019s international expansion, while leading sales and revenue growth. </p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an exciting time. There&#8217;s a lot of attention being paid to Canada as a country.&#8221;<br />\n&#8211; Kirstine Stewart\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Stewart has been a key figure in growing several tech companies in Canada after leaving her role as CBC\u2019s head of English services. Stewart was instrumental to establishing Twitter\u2019s Canadian presence as founding head of Twitter Canada, and was most recently chief strategy officer at content company Diply. During her time there, Diply ranked number one on Deloitte\u2019s Fast 50 Tech growth companies in Canada.</p>\n<p>\u201cTribalScale has the five key ingredients necessary for creating innovation; venture capital for<br />\nfunding new companies, a stellar rolodex of industry leaders, a global network and presence,<br />\npartnerships with corporations who trust us with their digital roadmaps, and a best-in-class team<br />\nof experts,\u201d said Jaitly. \u201cBringing Kirstine on as president is not only important for gender diversity at the C-level in our industry, but it positions TribalScale to accelerate our pace of innovation and take our company to new heights.\u201d</p>\n<p>Speaking with BetaKit, Stewart said that she took on an advisory role at Diply in October 2016 after helping the company reach a healthy growth trajectory. Stewart will remain an advisor to Diply, on top of advisory roles at TheScore, WOW! Unlimited Media, Kognitiv, The DMZ, and #MoveTheDial. \u201cA lot of good boxes were checked off,\u201d Stewart said of her decision to step down from her CSO role. </p>\n<p>During that time, she was as a speaker at TribalScale\u2019s Innovation Conference, where she got to know the team. \u201cThey built a business based on helping other businesses transform from web to mobile.

Joe Poulin, founder and CEO of Luxury Retreats, and Peter Kern, director of Expedia and managing partner of InterMedia Partners, were angel investors in Busbud. Magaly Charbonneau, principal at iNovia, will join Busbud&#8217;s board. </p>\n<p>The funding will be used for further tech development, hiring, and geographic expansion.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe support from a group of investors with such a phenomenal track record of success is fantastic validation for Busbud and a true testament to the innovation we\u2019re bringing to an oft-overlooked mode of transportation as well as to bus travellers worldwide,\u201d said Busbud co-founder and CEO LP Maurice. \u201cWith their commitment to our growth, we\u2019re confident the next leg of our journey will be a successful one.\u201d </p>\n<p>Busbud&#8217;s online marketplace allows travelers to shop for and book intercity bus tickets. The company currently has over 1,300 bus companies in 16,000 cities across 75 countries, supporting transactions in 30 currencies. </p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/busbud-raises-14-million-series-b-with-former-expedia-ceo-luxury-retreats-investors/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>mnubo raises $16.5 million to help manufacturers embrace IoT</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/mnubo-raises-16-5-million-to-help-manufacturers-embrace-iot/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/mnubo-raises-16-5-million-to-help-manufacturers-embrace-iot/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2018 13:00:10 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[funding]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iot]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Montreal]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=127815</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Montreal-based mnubo has raised $16.5 million as it looks to continue international expansion. mnubo&#8217;s SmartObjects IoT platform is targeted to manufacturers, and analyzes data...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>Montreal-based mnubo has raised $16.5 million as it looks to continue international expansion. </p>\n<p>mnubo&#8217;s SmartObjects IoT platform is targeted to manufacturers, and analyzes data collected from sensors on smart devices to provide insight about the way people are using their products.

The coalition specifically mentioned Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Spotify \u2014 as well as the technology and digital services they provide \u2014 in its declaration. \u201cThe popularity of the devices and services has adversely affected the revenue share generated by Canadian cultural and information content,\u201d reads an excerpt from the CCM\u2019s declaration. \u201cCreators, producers, publishers and distributors no longer reap the majority of the return on their investments.\u201d </p>\n<p>In the past, organizations have proposed introducing a levy on streaming services dubbed the \u2018Netflix Tax.\u2019 In reality, the term doesn\u2019t refer to one particular tax, but rather several potential forms of taxation or contribution.</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/01/18/canadian-media-coalition-government-netflix-tax/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MobileSyrup</a></em></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/canadian-media-coalition-wants-government-to-reconsider-netflix-tax-stance/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>MedStack&#8217;s Balaji Gopalan says companies must tell the stories of their customers</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/medstacks-balaji-gopalan-says-companies-must-tell-the-stories-of-their-customers/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/medstacks-balaji-gopalan-says-companies-must-tell-the-stories-of-their-customers/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2018 12:00:05 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[events]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[healthtech]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[techto]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=127647</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[While entrepreneurs may be excited about their products and how they&#8217;ll change the industry, it&#8217;s hard to translate that excitement into a story everyone...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>While entrepreneurs may be excited about their products and how they&#8217;ll change the industry, it&#8217;s hard to translate that excitement into a story everyone understands. </p>\n<p>Speaking at the latest TechTO, MedStack founder Balaji Gopalan talked about how his company approached this problem. Medstack&#8217;s developer platform allows entrepreneurs to build healthcare applications, which can be difficult to navigate since hospitals have complex onboarding processes \u2014 and because it&#8217;s in the business of providing infrastructure, it&#8217;s hard to tangibly show its impact to investors and people outside the company. </p>\n<p>To tackle the issue, Gopalan suggests talking about your customers instead of the product. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t the tech. It isn&#8217;t the UI, it isn&#8217;t the business model. It&#8217;s the customers and the stories they have to tell about your products.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He shared some of the companies that are using MedStack \u2014 people who are disrupting the healthcare industry in their own way, and how MedStack makes it easier for them to build their businesses. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Why do we eat like crap? Why do we get yelled at? Why do we deal with so much stress and give up on sleep? For entrepreneurs in the room asking, &#8216;why do we do that?&#8217; Remember, it&#8217;s because of your customers. If you want inspiration, that&#8217;s where you look.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Watch the full video below:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E0pET_bLqg0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The next TechTO takes place on February 12.

href=\"https://3iq.ca/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">3iQ</a> said it has agreed to terms and conditions with the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) and the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) to act as a portfolio manager and investment fund manager investing in multiple cryptoassets. </p>\n<p>3iQ says that it is the first fund created in Ontario that can be sold across Canada. Units of 3iQ&#8217;s Global Cryptoasset Fund will be available to accredited investors, advisors, and dealers via Fundserv, and to pension funds, institutions, and family offices via private placement. The fund is structured as a trust, and will invest directly in bitcoin, ether, and litecoins through a passive investments strategy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have worked diligently to provide a pure, low-cost, secure method for both accredited and institutional investors to assume a core position in this new and expanding asset class,&#8221; said 3iQ CEO Frederick Pye. &#8220;Although an exempt market product, we at 3iQ are excited to offer this product with our partners and to bring a diversified basket of leading digital assets to institutions and qualified investors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>CSA <a href=\"https://www.securities-administrators.ca/nrs/nrsFirmSearchResults.aspx?mode=QS&#038;type=F&#038;firm=3iq\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">published the terms and conditions</a> for the fund to function in Ontario and Quebec to cover risks associated with cryptocurrencies. Some of the conditions include providing a report from an independent auditor or similar document from the principal regulator before the fund&#8217;s calendar year end, annual audited financial statements to securityholders, and a change in the firm&#8217;s policies and procedures which are used to value cryptocurrencies held by any investment fund managed by the firm. </p>\n<p>The two regulatory bodies have been outspoken in their caution of cryptocurrencies in the past. In August 2017, Canadian Securities Administrators put out a statement <a href=\"https://betakit.com/canadian-securities-administrators-says-icos-must-consider-securities-laws/\">reminding companies to take regulations into account for ICOs</a>. Less than a month later, Kik <a href=\"https://betakit.com/kik-excluding-canadians-from-kin-token-distribution-event/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">excluded Canada from its ICO</a>, citing uncertainty from the OSC.  </p>\n<p>3iQ aims to launch and complete its first close within the next few weeks. </p>\n<p><em>Photo via <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/JrjhtBJ-pGU\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></em></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/3iq-first-firm-to-have-osc-and-csa-approved-crypto-fund/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Coinsquare planning $150 million IPO this year</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/coinsquare-planning-150-million-ipo-this-year/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/coinsquare-planning-150-million-ipo-this-year/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2018 20:36:04 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FinTech]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=127611</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency exchange Coinsquare is planning to raise $150 million in an IPO in September, according to a report from Bloomberg.

The company said it is avoiding the reverse takeover route to list on the exchange, which doesn&#8217;t require a full securities commission review compared to IPOs. In fact, Diamond said that an IPO is one of the best ways to prove it&#8217;s transparent compared to other exchanges. \u201cWe believe that there are a tremendous amount of low-quality deals going public,\u201d Diamond told Bloomberg. </p>\n<p>The company is currently in the process of raising $50 million in financing led by Canaccord and Cormark Securities.

The fund will enable young researchers to complete their education through a new series of scholarships at universities. The first of these scholarships will be at the University of Waterloo, where it will create the GM Canada Innovators Award for students pursing graduate work in engineering.</p>\n<p>\u201cGM\u2019s commitment to diversity in innovation by expanding their STEM program for young Canadian women, will inspire the next generation of astronauts, engineers, doctors and even video game developers,&#8221; said  Navdeep Bains, Canada\u2019s Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development. &#8220;GM is helping ensure that Canadian youth have the digital skills for the jobs of the future. Congratulations to the company on the official opening of their new Mobility Software Tech centre. Proof once more that Canada is truly leading when it comes to the \u2018car of the future\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>GM Canada also plans to engage the wider innovation ecosystem across Canada with new university partnerships. Its most recent is a partnership with the Creative Destruction Lab at the University of Toronto.  </p>\n<p>GM Canada made the announcement at the unveiling of their new technical centre, CTC Markham, earlier this month. The centre will focus on software development and innovation in vehicles, in-car infotainment systems, and software and controls related to self-driving vehicles.</p>\n<p>\u201cCTC Markham represents a new kind of GM workplace, centred on collaboration, open design, and creativity,\u201d said Brian Tossan, director of GM\u2019s Canadian Technical Centre. \u201cGM Canada is at the forefront of reinventing mobility right here in Markham. We are helping develop software and systems that will enable us to save lives, reduce emissions and create smarter and better ways to travel, work and play. We\u2019ve had a great year of growing our workforce, and we\u2019re not done yet; we are still actively recruiting several hundred engineers and software developers to help us achieve our vision.\u201d  </p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/gm-canada-launches-1-8-million-stem-fund-supporting-educational-programs-for-girls/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Canadian gov&#8217;t and World Economic Forum want to use biometrics to expedite air travel</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/canadian-govt-and-world-economic-forum-want-to-use-biometrics-to-expedite-air-travel/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/canadian-govt-and-world-economic-forum-want-to-use-biometrics-to-expedite-air-travel/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2018 16:59:48 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[govt]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=127579</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The Canadian announced that it is collaborating with the World Economic Forum, Accenture, and other partners to test emerging digital technologies and their application...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>The Canadian announced that it is collaborating with the World Economic Forum, Accenture, and other partners to test emerging digital technologies and their application to air travel. </p>\n<p>The government is working on a Known Traveller Digital Identity prototype, which is working to create the seamless flow of people across borders.</p>\n<p>The government will design a proof of concept pilot project between two countries, working with emerging biometrics and distributed ledger technologies to give travellers the ability to share their information with authorities for expedited clearance. </p>\n<p>The government is working with the Netherlands to explore opportunities of digital identity systems to engender trust and cooperation between international partners. </p>\n<p>\u201cInnovation is key to enhancing global competitiveness, mobility and productivity. Leveraging new technological advancements can support risk-based approaches to public safety and security, making air travel more efficient while improving the travel experience,\u201d said Canadian Minister of Transport Marc Garneau. </p>\n<p>The prototype and pilot result from two years of thorough cooperation between public and private sector partners in the World Economic Forum\u2019s Security in Travel Project. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The use of distributed ledger technology can foster an unprecedented level of trust between governments, businesses and travel providers that becomes stronger over time as more interactions take place across the travel ecosystem,\u201d said Liselotte de Maar, managing director in Accenture\u2019s Travel practice. \u201cThe KTDI concept removes friction from travelling while ensuring greater security at each touchpoint, from hotel check-in to border control. By enabling travellers to share their validated identity information through the KTDI, it allows receiving organizations the advantage of knowing in advance with whom they will interact.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Photo via <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/71hQxE-Sfvg\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></em></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/canadian-govt-and-world-economic-forum-want-to-use-biometrics-to-expedite-air-travel/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Report: Canadians want user-friendly information on privacy policies</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/report-canadians-want-user-friendly-information-on-privacy-policies/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/report-canadians-want-user-friendly-information-on-privacy-policies/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2018 16:18:01 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Mackenzie Allen]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[report]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=127565</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[A study commissioned by the Canadian Marketing Association (CMA) has revealed a lot about how Canadians feel about privacy policies.

According to the study, most Canadians find privacy policies too long and difficult to understand, and as a result do not read or only read part of these policies. </p>\n<p>Additionally, many feel that they don\u2019t know enough about Canadian data privacy laws, individual rights and the obligations of companies. Large numbers show interest in reading user-friendly information to support privacy policies, such as summaries of terms or simplified explanations. </p>\n<p>Notably, two thirds prefer that companies provide privacy related information on their website, rather than through an app or emails from the company. Among the issues of least concern according to the data are how companies utilize third-party service parties, and, surprisingly, how companies monetize personal data. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe issues of transparency and accountability are in the forefront for many Canadians \u2013 our customers,\u201d said Amanda Maltby, CMA Privacy and Data Advisory Committee\u2019s chair and general manager. \u201cIn addition to providing insights into consumer data privacy attitudes and behaviours, the survey reveals customer expectations about how we need to interact with them. Consumers tell us they are indeed interested in privacy information, but that it needs to be provided to them in a user-friendly way.\u201d </p>\n<p>Suzanne Morin, the committee\u2019s project lead, stated that \u201cthe results provide valuable input for our committee to develop best practice guidance for marketers to better communicate about data use and privacy. A layered approach that gives consumers key information with the option to go deeper, for example, a short and mobile friendly \u2018label\u2019 that can be taken in with a glance. The goal is to provide privacy information that demystifies data use and draws attention to what Canadians value most \u2014 it\u2019s time for Transparency 2.0.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/01/26/study-canadian-privacy-policies/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MobileSyrup</a></em></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/report-canadians-want-user-friendly-information-on-privacy-policies/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Ask an Investor: Do I need insurance for my startup?</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/ask-an-investor-do-i-need-insurance-for-my-startup/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/ask-an-investor-do-i-need-insurance-for-my-startup/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2018 12:00:32 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Christian Lassonde]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[ask an investor]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Feature]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Resource]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[vc]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=127543</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Welcome to a BetaKit weekly series designed to help startups and entrepreneurs.

Each week, investors tackle the tough questions facing founders today. Have a question you would like answered? Tweet them with the #askaninvestor hashtag, or email them <a href=\"mailto:askaninvestor@betakit.com\" target=\"_top\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<hr width=\"20%\" />\n<p>The short answer is maybe. </p>\n<p>The long answer, from my perspective both as a founder who lived through getting insurance as well as an investor helping navigate our portfolio companies through insurance, requires some short background theory. The purpose of insurance is to protect the value of what you have built in the event of certain events: someone hurting themselves in your office, a hacker stealing your code, an irate shareholder suing the company. In the event one of these many possible events occur, rather than paying for the cost of these events out of the company\u2019s bank account, your insurance company pays for them. In return, you pay your insurance company on a regular basis regardless if anything occurs or not. </p>\n<p>The key words are &#8220;protect value.\u201d A startup that is little more than a sketch on a napkin has no tangible value. There is nothing to insure. </p>\n<h3>The office</h3>\n<p>The first time a new startup will need to get insurance is not because they suddenly have something of value to protect. It&#8217;s because they moved into a space that is requiring protection. I&#8217;m talking about office space. The owner of the office space will want their property (their value) protected from activities that occur within your business. </p>\n<blockquote><p>If your startup is still in the pre-revenue, the smallest required GL policy is all you\u2019ll want to get.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Accidents happen even in tech businesses. Back in my startup days I was moving a large server from one rack to another and accidentally dropped it on one of my fingers, almost severing the tip. A quick hospital trip and insurance claim later, all was better, but the example serves as a reminder that far worse accidents can still happen within our relatively quiet office spaces. </p>\n<p>The type of insurance you\u2019ll need is a general liability and property insurance. General liability and property insurance protects against third party property or bodily damage. It\u2019s not that expensive and can be considered the base layer for all other commercial insurance products.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re curious at what all those other products are, just look at the list of exclusions in your general liability policy. You\u2019ll notice that everything from employee practice claims, emotional distress, pension liability, pollution, acts of terrorism, cybersecurity to nuclear energy hazard are excluded. The list of exclusions is really long.</p>\n<p>If your startup is still in the pre-revenue/pre-MPV stage, the smallest required GL policy is all you\u2019ll want to get. You&#8217;re not protecting the value of the company \u2014 you&#8217;re protecting the minimum necessary value for your landlord. You do that by adding the property owner as \u201cadditional insured,\u201d an insurance industry term for who else, other than your company, can lay claim to the insurance money.</p>\n<h3>The client</h3>\n<p>For B2B companies, the next time you will encounter insurance needs may come at your first big sale. Big companies like to have services agreement where they are protected from you, in the event you do something you shouldn\u2019t. That&#8217;s typically done by purchasing Errors and Omissions insurance (E&#038;O). Like GL, it\u2019s usually not a terrible price and, frankly, having it is a cost of doing business. As with your general policy, your client(s) will likely want to be a named additional insured on your policy.</p>\n<h3>The venture capitalist</h3>\n<p>Any startup that receives an institutional investment (i.e. venture funding), especially if the investor takes a board seat, will likely be required to get directors and officers (D&#038;O) insurance. </p>\n<p>D&#038;O insurance protects the VCs individually and their investment funds from the activity of the board of directors. In other words, the board of directors as it regularly reviews and updates everything from the strategic plan, to the CEO&#8217;s compensation, will make decisions. In due course of those board decisions, it&#8217;s possible they could upset shareholders or other stakeholders to the point of legal action.  D&#038;O insurance is meant to protect the interests of board members. Hence, why D&#038;O insurance is a prerequisite for investors who will join your board. </p>\n<p>Lastly, later stage funding rounds may require the company to take on key man insurance on the Founder/CEO and possibly other key executives. Key man insurance is a form of life insurance where the beneficiary is the company rather than the individual&#8217;s estate.</p>\n<p>There are of course many other insurances out there, but these are the four a tech company will typically face in its early years.</p>\n<p>PS: I\u2019ve left off worker&#8217;s compensation insurance, mainly because my experience is in the US, where workers comp and health benefits are entirely different, and in Ontario where software development is exempt from WSIB. I\u2019ve also left off cyber insurance, which is still relatively new and few if any startups have it. </p>\n<hr width=\"20%\" />\n<h4> Sarah&#8217;s take</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/14882366_10157709816720253_5583206595414963638_o-1.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Marion\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-50164\" /></p>\n<p>Christian did a great job covering the types of insurance products that startups need. You\u2019re rarely going to get a term sheet pulled during legal diligence if you don\u2019t have coverage, but as the value of your startup grows, the value you have at stake from an uninsured incident grows. </p>\n<p>This is a relatively linear equation with your balance sheet. By incorporating your startup, you as the founder take on a limited liability position, which prevents financial losses to the amount invested in the corporation. The exception is when you accept debt which includes a personal guarantee, extending your legal obligation to include your personal assets. </p>\n<p>In general, there are six main inflection points at which you should reflect on your insurance needs (alongside a trusted legal or financial planning advisor who understand startup needs specifically \u2014 don\u2019t ask your estate planner). </p>\n<p>Those inflection points are when you: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Incorporate your business</li>\n<li>Add employees to payroll</li>\n<li>Move into a new office</li>\n<li>Close a round of funding</li>\n<li>Sign clients</li>\n<li>See significant revenue growth (necessitating a conversation about coverage limits).</li>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/ask-an-investor-do-i-need-insurance-for-my-startup/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Ford acquires Autonomic to double down on mobility services</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/ford-acquires-autonomic-to-double-down-on-mobility-services/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/ford-acquires-autonomic-to-double-down-on-mobility-services/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2018 00:11:39 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iot]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=127529</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Ford has acquired Palo Alto, California-based Autonomic.ai, which is building infrastructure for smart mobility applications and services.

For some founders, however, that passion is to not only build a great business, but to do good in the world.</p>\n<p>Studio 1 Labs has developed fabric sensors, using them in an intelligent bed sheet patient monitor for long-term care. Borne of its founders\u2019 mission to offer low-cost, high-quality preventative care around the world, these fabric sensors send data to computers that use AI and machine learning algorithms to give doctors real-time information about a patient\u2019s health and wellbeing.</p>\n<p>The end goal is a clinically-tested medical device accepted in long-term care and healthcare institutions around the world.</p>\n<h3> Building the technology</h3>\n<p>After grad school, Studio 1 Labs co-founder Dr. Olivia Lin developed an interest in textiles and how they relate to human learning and behaviour, the topic of her PhD.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Studio 1 Labs\u2019 algorithms alert doctors if something may go wrong.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Connecting with co-founder Edward Shim, an idea blossomed for a textile to help identify and track that behaviour. After a series of mentorship programs with organizations like IBM, the team built the intelligent bed sheet prototype. </p>\n<p>The sheet has sensors built into the fabric, which measures respiration, movement, and other factors that may indicate health issues. The sheet is also connected to a machine learning-based algorithm that identifies precursor trends for doctors. With a particular focus on early detection of symptoms, Studio 1 Labs\u2019 algorithms alert doctors if something may go wrong, leading to preventative measures. </p>\n<h3> A product-market pivot</h3>\n<p>Initially, the founding team thought the sheet would be perfect for babies. Given infant mortality rates in developing nations around the world, the ability to detect early warning signs such as respiratory distress could mean the difference between life and death. However, early user testing showed that many parents were wary.</p>\n<p>\u201cSome of the earliest user feedback was that parents don\u2019t trust the fabric because they don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d explained Lin. \u201cIt\u2019s not about learning a new technology\u2026 it\u2019s about consumers feeling a technology is medically validated.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p>On the medical side, new technologies cannot disrupt or harm currently existing technologies.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With user feedback showing that people feel safer using products with scientific or medical validation, the team went ahead in seeking clinical trials to ensure its technology would be an approved \u201cmedical device.\u201d Unfortunately, Studio 1 Labs discovered that testing on babies is nearly impossible due to medical sensitivities and consent issues. </p>\n<p>Facing the loss of its core target market, the team planned a pivot into the senior long-term care market. Senior patients, the team found, liked that they couldn\u2019t notice the technology within the bed sheet. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t even feel the technology; it\u2019s a soft fabric that just feels like your bed sheet,\u201d said Lin. \u201cThey don\u2019t notice it, and that\u2019s what they like about it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lin noted that any new medical device, if it wants widespread adoption, has to fit seamlessly with a patient\u2019s current routine. </p>\n<p>This requirement has multiple elements. On the medical side, new technologies cannot disrupt or harm currently existing technologies, so certain wireless wavelengths must be avoided and other considerations taken into account. </p>\n<p>On the patient side, Studio 1\u2019s target market already faced many necessary treatments that are intrusive and undignified. The company\u2019s product had to be different, fitting into a routine and requiring no mental cognition for the patient, while providing additional benefit to the medical staff. </p>\n<h3>A shared culture for care</h3>\n<p>Addressing crucial user experience questions and having the wherewithal to pivot into new markets requires a strong team, and Lin is proud of the one she and Shim have built. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe entire team has a passion for making lives better, but we approach it from different ways,\u201d Lin said. \u201cOne of Edward [Shim]\u2019s strengths is bringing people together and working on hardware, whereas I focus more on scientific validation, and analytics. It\u2019s been a huge team effort with interns, researchers, partners, and collaborators helping as well.\u201d </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Very cool to learn about Studio 1 Labs&#39; functional bed sheet with fabric sensor technology at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IBMCanada?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@IBMCanada</a>&#39;s new Innovation Space in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Markham?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Markham</a>. <a href=\"https://t.co/QLDAsAvN3e\">pic.twitter.com/QLDAsAvN3e</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Brad Duguid (@BradDuguid) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BradDuguid/status/861689299074469889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 8, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>On top of having the scientific chops to tackle this problem, Shim and Lin also prioritized diversity on the team. Lin said that the diversity present on the team means higher quality work and asking better questions, which pushes Studio 1 Labs to think beyond its initial assumptions. </p>\n<p>After the successful pivot into the senior market, the company plans to improve its fabric sensor capabilities to track other vital factors based on user testing and feedback. The team has already begun testing with young adults, and Studio 1 Labs has completed clinical trials.</p>\n<p>Lin explained that throughout Studio 1 Labs\u2019 trials, pivots, and next steps, the team stressed collaborations and partnerships. </p>\n<p>&#8220;IBM has been a huge supporter,&#8221; she said, stating that Studio 1 Labs&#8217; partnership with the company provided not only resources but connections to industry players and computational power. </p>\n<p>Lin said that the company\u2019s journey included support from partners and collaborators, including two IBM Innovation Space locations (Markham Convergence Centre and 185 Spadina), Innovation York, SOSCIP, Ontario Centres of Excellence (OCE), and others.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The resources [we got from partners] helped our ideas,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Not just the technology change&#8230; but in what&#8217;s accessible in society right now.&#8221;</p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/tech-for-good-studio-1-labs-focuses-on-trust-and-user-experience-to-help-doctors-better-care-for-patients/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Bright + Early wants to help Toronto&#8217;s scrappy startups embrace HR</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/bright-early-wants-to-help-torontos-scrappy-startups-embrace-hr/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/bright-early-wants-to-help-torontos-scrappy-startups-embrace-hr/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:06:23 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[impact]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=127433</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The Toronto tech ecosystem is getting attention in many areas; companies are reaching their next phases of growth, attracting international tech giants, and entrepreneurs...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>The Toronto tech ecosystem is getting attention in many areas; companies are reaching their next phases of growth, attracting international tech giants, and entrepreneurs that have found success are supporting the next generation of entrepreneurs.  </p>\n<p>But as these companies grow, so too does the need to keep a healthy culture in check. Seeing a desire from Toronto companies to avoid becoming the next Uber story \u2014 but <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-to-bootstrap-your-startups-hr-and-when-not-to-8f2c46902e7\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">not knowing where to start</a> \u2014 former Wealthsimple director of people operations Nora Jenkins Townson launched <a href=\"http://www.brightandearly.ca/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bright + Early</a>, an HR consultancy targeting Toronto early-stage and mid-stage companies.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeeing things like how excited people were for Lyft to come to Toronto, it proves that people \u2014 Canadians especially \u2014 want to support companies that are great to work for,\u201d said Jenkins Townson.</p>\n<p>Bright + Early\u2019s program is specifically targeted to each company it works with; Jenkins Townson finds that a lot of traditional HR handbooks don&#8217;t speak to the creative culture of startups. It works across the spectrum of HR, from compliance basics, building plans for internal talent to scale up, and talent branding to get companies telling their stories. The company\u2019s clients so far include Wealthsimple, Tulip Retail, and CrowdRiff.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_127445\" style=\"max-width: 790px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nora-jenkins-townson-1.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nora-jenkins-townson-1.jpg\" alt=\"nora jenkins townson\" width=\"780\" height=\"780\" class=\"size-full wp-image-127445\" srcset=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nora-jenkins-townson-1.jpg 780w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nora-jenkins-townson-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nora-jenkins-townson-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nora-jenkins-townson-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nora-jenkins-townson-1-600x600.jpg 600w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nora-jenkins-townson-1-580x580.jpg 580w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nora-jenkins-townson-1-180x180.jpg 180w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nora Jenkins Townson, founder of Bright + Early</p></div>\n<p>\u201cI see companies earlier and earlier wanting to have things like parental leave policies and harassment policies, and they feel uncomfortable without those things in place. In the past you used to see companies bragging about not having HR, even in companies over 100. And I think the tide is turning on that,\u201d said Jenkins Townson.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s particularly keen on working with startups; while she has 10 years of HR experience under her belt, she hasn\u2019t worked for a corporate office, instead preferring the experience of the early-stage where her efforts have the most impact. \u201cI would say that it\u2019s really the pace. These companies are looking to grow from 10 people and in a basement to 150 people or more in a year, and usually they have to build everything at once.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bright + Early also provides workshops on creating inclusive workplaces \u2014 a major topic of interest in an industry that generally struggles with representation. From the language in employee handbooks to ensuring that careers pages have inclusivity statements and parental leave policies, there are a lot of seemingly small ways startups don\u2019t realize they\u2019re giving people the wrong signals.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really inspired by product design and management when building the types of programs that we do,\u201d said Jenkins Townson.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There\u2019s a lot of people in business that might believe you can\u2019t lead with kindness or have a culture of kindness and achieve your business objectives.&#8221;<br />\n&nbsp;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bright + Early also collects data on how employees are using the programs. Collecting data is likely one of the most basic calls to action from diversity advocates, as it <a href=\"http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/count-me-collecting-human-rights-based-data/3-collecting-data-%E2%80%93-consider-benefits\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">allows companies to measure where they have gaps in retention or hiring</a>, and make pointed steps toward improvement. In the past year, companies like Hubba have launched free frameworks to survey diversity <a href=\"https://betakit.com/heres-a-framework-for-surveying-diversity-in-your-tech-company/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in a sensitive and effective way</a>, while Feminuity and Fortay urge companies to <a href=\"https://betakit.com/companies-building-diversity-surveys-must-consider-metrics-of-belonging/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">go a step further</a> and consider metrics of belonging \u2014 or whether employees feel they can be their authentic selves. </p>\n<p>For Bright + Early\u2019s case in particular, collecting data accomplishes two things: It allows the company to  tweak as necessary to ensure that programs aren\u2019t just falling by the wayside, and it establishes a \u201cline of trust\u201d between the company and the leadership team. Like sharing funding and growth milestones, involving the team in the process of building responsible companies gets people motivated, Jenkins Townson says. </p>\n<p>In the end, the hope is to help companies realize that it\u2019s possible to build the next rocketship business without losing sight of the people that helped you get there. </p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people in business that might believe you can\u2019t lead with kindness or have a culture of kindness and achieve your business objectives. I really disagree with that. I think the top companies, performance-wise, in the future will be those that are building kind workplaces.\u201d</p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/bright-early-wants-to-help-torontos-scrappy-startups-embrace-hr/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Hack To Start Ep.184: Gessica Bicego, Blinklist head of performance marketing</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/hack-to-start-ep-184-gessica-bicego-blinklist-head-of-performance-marketing/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/hack-to-start-ep-184-gessica-bicego-blinklist-head-of-performance-marketing/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2018 14:00:33 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Franco Varriano]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[saas]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=127425</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Gessica Bicego is the head of performance marketing at Blinkist, the platform for bite-sized insights in audio or text.

By June 2017, the company then announced a partnership with CIBC, allowing its clients to access credit scores <a href=\"https://betakit.com/cibc-partners-with-borrowell-to-offer-free-credit-scores/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">through the CIBC mobile banking app</a>. The company has since been focusing on providing financial tools to customers, and <a href=\"https://betakit.com/borrowell-raises-57-million-series-a-from-portag3-firstontario-credit-union/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">raised $57 million in July</a> to expand its free credit and loan offerings.  </p>\n<p>\u201cNow more than ever, Canadians should keep a close eye on their credit and personal finances,\u201d said Andrew Graham, Borrowell\u2019s co-founder and CEO. \u201cWe were proud to be the first company in Canada to offer consumers free access to their credit scores. This is a logical next step for us, and gives our users a much deeper look into their overall credit profile, the same data used by many lenders, banks, cell phone providers and landlords.\u201d</p>\n<p>New and existing Borrowell members can access data from their Equifax credit file through Borrowell.com, and checking their score and report through Borrowell does not negatively impact their credit scores. To date, Borrowell says it has provided credit information to nearly 500,000 Canadians.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt has never been more important for Canadian consumers to be educated about their financial position,\u201d said Chris Briggs, Equifax Canada\u2019s chief marketing officer. \u201cEquifax has long supported consumer credit education, and by deepening our partnership with Borrowell, we aim to make it easier for Canadians to learn more about the information contained in their credit report.\u201d</p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/borrowell-launches-free-equifax-credit-report-monitoring/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Vancouver startup creates VR arcade on wheels</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/vancouver-startup-creates-vr-arcade-on-wheels/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/vancouver-startup-creates-vr-arcade-on-wheels/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2018 13:00:42 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Bradly Shankar]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[vancouver]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[vr]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[wearables]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=127313</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Vancouver startup Mobile Reality has launched the world\u2019s first mobile virtual reality arcade, a customized trailer that can travel to public spaces like fairs,...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>Vancouver startup Mobile Reality has launched the world\u2019s first mobile virtual reality arcade, a customized trailer that can travel to public spaces like fairs, festivals, and city streets. </p>\n<p>With eight networked virtual reality gaming stations, Mobile Reality says it can offer daily racing and flight simulations to hundreds of customers every day. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe are excited to be rolling out the Mobile Reality Titan Trailer,\u201d said co-owner Dave Rice in a press statement. \u201cOur experience gives people of any skill level the thrill of premium seated VR, networked together so that groups play together, at the same time in the same game.\u201d </p>\n<p>To celebrate the launch, Mobile Reality is offering free sessions \u2014 which typically last around 25 minutes \u2014 from January 25th to January 27th at LaSalle College Vancouver on 2665 Renfrew Street. </p>\n<p>On Mobile Reality\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.mobilereality.online/tickets\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, customers can claim free tickets using the discount code \u201cMOBILEVR.\u201d Sessions will otherwise cost $20 CAD. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe soft launch helps us finesse our practices and get the word out about our brand,\u201d said co-owner Scott Belyea in a press statement. \u201cWe aim to be the most efficient VR service available, a sit-down-and-go type of experience for all ages, while delivering the highest possible quality product. There\u2019s enough second-rate VR out there posing as authentic and we want people to know us as the difference.\u201d </p>\n<p>Outside of arcades, opportunities to demo virtual reality can be few and far in between, so Mobile Reality\u2019s offering is certainly a novel concept.

the MoneyTree report on Canadian investment trends in Q4 2017, with an overall glimpse into how the country performed throughout the year. </p>\n<p>Canadian companies raised $3.3 billion ($2.7 billion USD) across 333 deals in 2017, <a href=\"https://betakit.com/pwc-moneytree-report-canada-held-firm-in-2016-amidst-down-vc-activity-around-the-globe/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">compared to $2.2 billion ($1.7 billion USD)</a> the previous year. Total funding and average amount of funding increased seven percent and 31 percent respectively, while deal activity decreased by 12 percent. </p>\n<p>In total, $940 million ($757 million USD) was distributed across 76 deals in Q4 2017, making Q4 the second largest quarter for funding in 2017. This was an increase from Q4 2016&#8217;s 71 deals though the report notes that there were 22 fewer deals in Q4 2017 compared to the previous quarter. PwC national deals technology leader Michael Dingle, however, says this decrease is no cause for concern.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-23-at-7.39.55-PM.png\" alt=\"pwc cb insights\" width=\"770\" height=\"587\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-127263\" srcset=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-23-at-7.39.55-PM.png 770w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-23-at-7.39.55-PM-300x229.png 300w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-23-at-7.39.55-PM-768x585.png 768w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-23-at-7.39.55-PM-600x457.png 600w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-23-at-7.39.55-PM-761x580.png 761w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></p>\n<p>Dingle also noted that Canadian businesses are now moving beyond seed stage financing, something BetaKit called out in our healthtech deep dive <a href=\"https://betakit.com/2017-shows-healthtech-funding-primed-to-grow-in-2018/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">at the end of last year</a>, where Dingle argued that an increase in expansion stage funding means companies are finding their product-market fit. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt tells us that the [idea] we all had years ago around whether Canadian companies continue to attract funding and get to that scale-up stage was true.&#8221;<br />\n&#8211; Michael Dingle\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Q4 2017 was the second quarter in a row to have seed-stage deals declined, from 30 percent to 28 percent, and the share of early-stage deals also declined from 28 percent in Q3 2017 to 20 percent in the fourth quarter. The average deal size increased 31 percent from $10 million ($8.3 million USD) to $13 million ($10.9 million).</p>\n<p>\u201cIt tells us that the [idea] we all had years ago around whether Canadian companies continue to attract funding and get to that scale-up stage was true, and this data is proving that Canadian companies can do it regularly. What we\u2019re seeing is a good sign in every respect,\u201d Dingle said.</p>\n<p>As for the thematic areas that are driving an increase in expansion stage funding, cybersecurity, digital health, and FinTech are three industries to watch out for. Full-year funding totals for Canadian cybersecurity companies increased by 79 percent in 2017 \u2014 <a href=\"https://betakit.com/today-in-funding-100m-helios-wire-esentire/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">largely driven by eSentire\u2019s $100 million mega-round in Q3 2017</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-23-at-7.41.57-PM.png\" alt=\"pwc moneytree report\" width=\"759\" height=\"595\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-127265\" srcset=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-23-at-7.41.57-PM.png 759w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-23-at-7.41.57-PM-300x235.png 300w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-23-at-7.41.57-PM-600x470.png 600w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-23-at-7.41.57-PM-740x580.png 740w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px\" /></p>\n<p>Canada&#8217;s AI and FinTech sectors were specifically called out by CB Insights CEO Anand Sanwal. &#8220;One bright spot for the market has been funding to Canadian AI and Fintech companies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is worth keeping an eye on these sectors going forward as market leaders in these areas have the potential to draw more significant venture funding in the coming years.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>One piece that Dingle specifically wanted to call out was Asia\u2019s increased presence in investments.<br />\n&nbsp;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Funding to Canadian AI companies surpassed 2016 full-year totals by a wide margin. AI attracted $312 million ($252 million USD) across 31 deals. Total funding to Canadian FinTech companies increased to $566 million CAD ($456 million USD), up from $559 million ($450 million USD) in 2016. Keeping with overall trends of declining deal activity, deal activity to FinTechs declined from 43 deals in 2016 to 37 in the full year 2017.</p>\n<p>When it came to sectors, internet financing declined with $935 million ($753 million USD) invested across 132 deals, down from 166 deals in 2016. Canadian mobile companies saw eight less deals in 2017, whereas funding increased by 66 percent for a total $539 million ($434 million USD). Healthcare companies saw six more deals in 2017, while funding declined 24 percent.</p>\n<p>Corporate participation also grew last year, as 28 percent of all deals to Canadian companies featured at least one corporate or corporate venture capital investor in 2017, up from 16 percent in 2016. In BetaKit\u2019s deep-dive <a href=\"https://betakit.com/canadas-strong-ai-talent-could-attract-more-corporate-vc-funding/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on corporate participation</a>, Canada\u2019s high-quality of life, openness to immigration, and burgeoning AI ecosystem may be attracting corporates interested in Canadian tech.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Year over year, corporates are showing twice the support for venture-backed companies in 2017,&#8221; said Dave Planques, national deals leader at PwC Canada in the report. &#8220;This is also reflective of the global results, as the theme of collaboration and strategic partnerships between incumbents and the technology sector continues to evolve.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-23-at-7.43.37-PM-1.png\" alt=\"Pwc Moneytree report\" width=\"773\" height=\"591\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-127281\" srcset=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-23-at-7.43.37-PM-1.png 773w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-23-at-7.43.37-PM-1-300x229.png 300w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-23-at-7.43.37-PM-1-768x587.png 768w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-23-at-7.43.37-PM-1-600x459.png 600w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-23-at-7.43.37-PM-1-759x580.png 759w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px\" /></p>\n<p>While Canadian companies raising $3.3 billion CAD was a point of celebration in the report, it pales in comparison to overall North American activity. In North America, $92 billion ($74.5 billion USD) was invested across 5,365 deals, meaning US companies received around $89 billion ($71.8 billion USD) of that total. For 2017, Canada made up only six percent of total deal count and 3.6 percent of funding. But Dingle noted that it\u2019s important to anticipate this number increasing instead of comparing it to a more mature US ecosystem and its larger population. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to look at the history of VC activity and of the tech sector&#8230;just the population numbers we need to dig into that and realize we\u2019re talking about our major Canadian centres here,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you look at the US, you\u2019ve got substantial ecosystems&#8230;that have more than a head start. The Valley is the epicentre of all things venture globally. It doesn\u2019t surprise me to see that the funding isn\u2019t proportionate to the population basis.\u201d</p>\n<p>One piece that Dingle specifically wanted to call out was Asia\u2019s increased presence in investments. Canada-based investors represented at least 50 percent of all active investors in Canadian companies in seed and early-stage deals, while US investors participated in at least 40 percent of early and later-stage deals. Asian investors accounted for 10 percent of later stage deals; earlier this year, Wattpad confirmed an investor in China&#8217;s Tencent, which <a href=\"https://betakit.com/wattpad-raises-61-25-million-to-continue-investment-in-machine-learning-interactive-storytelling/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">led the storytelling platform&#8217;s $61 million round</a>.   </p>\n<p>He said that a look at global trends speaks to competition we\u2019re facing in sectors like AI and quantum \u2014 the Asian market is showing a higher risk appetite with $87 billion ($70.8 billion USD) in 2,847 deals, compared to the US\u2019 $91 billion ($74 billion USD) over 5,300 deals. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see more balance there; traditionally that Asian number hasn&#8217;t been as high. Just like corporate participation, when you start to see money come from geographies or come strategics, it means it\u2019s not just money,\u201d said Dingle. \u201cA Canadian technology company receiving support from an Asian investor is either, the Asian investor believing that the Canadian company can generate economic returns for them based on their current plan, or they are a strategic that wants to see the technology and team have impact in their markets.\u201d </p>\n<p>View the full report <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/ca/en/industries/technology/publications/money-tree-q4.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </p>\n<p><em>BetaKit is a PwC MoneyTree Canada media partner.</em></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/pwc-moneytree-report-canadian-tech-raised-3-3-billion-in-2017-as-ai-and-fintech-stayed-hot/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>TWG announces new CTO, VP of product as company grows executive team</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/twg-announces-new-cto-vp-of-product-as-company-grows-executive-team/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/twg-announces-new-cto-vp-of-product-as-company-grows-executive-team/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2018 22:03:40 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=127185</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Toronto-based TWG has announced that it is making changes to its executive team.

Cornebiese was an early employee of Deepmind before it was acquired by Google in 2012. He created and led the Health Applied Research Team, and has been working with Amnesty International since he left DeepMind in 2016.   </p>\n<p>The company says that it&#8217;s focusing on &#8216;AI for good&#8217; through this office, while also expanding its network of researchers, scientists, and the private and public sector. </p>\n<p>\u201cAI for food can mean many things \u2014 at Element AI, I see it as using AI and ML to empower those who are already fighting the good fights,\u201d said Cornebise. </p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Element AI\u2019s expansion into Europe with a London office is our first step in collaborating with Europe\u2019s top AI talent and connecting them with our AI teams in Canada.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u201cArtificial Intelligence and machine learning are powerful tools that deserve deployment beyond industrial, market-driven applications. Amazing people in NGOs, international organizations, and local initiatives alike, have dedicated their lives to solving the most important problems, such as fighting for human rights, more equitable access to resources, and education. At Element AI, we want to give these amazing organizations access to the type of AI talent that is out of reach for so many, working hand-in-hand on their world-changing programs and initiatives, driven by their domain knowledge.\u201d </p>\n<p>The office will also serve as Element AI\u2019s European head office with plans to grow to over 20 full-time researchers and employees. </p>\n<p>Element AI&#8217;s London office will focus on three core initiatives, including leveraging AI to help solve global issues by empowering NGOs, intergovernmental entities, and local actors; advancing methodological research as needed by these applications; and connecting AI scientists and engineers in developing nations through fellowships and visiting scholar programs. </p>\n<p>\u201cElement AI\u2019s expansion into Europe with a London office is our first step in collaborating with Europe\u2019s top AI talent and connecting them with our extensive AI teams in Canada; all while working with several of the most prestigious organizations to leverage AI for good,\u201d said Element AI CEO Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gagn\u00e9.</p>\n<p>\u201cElement AI is committed to enabling AI for Good in our society; we believe this technology can help tackle some of the world\u2019s most pressing issues and London will help make that a reality. We\u2019ve handpicked Dr. Julien Cornebise to lead our efforts in London because his values and experience aligns with Element AI\u2019s goal to balance advances in industry while leading the charge for positive social change. Julien\u2019s unique experience includes applying AI to humanitarian issues in collaboration with Amnesty International and co-founding the Health Research team during his time at DeepMind. We are confident that Julien is the right leader to kick start our European operations and are thrilled to have him on board.\u201d </p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/element-ai-opens-london-office-to-focus-on-building-ethical-ai/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Sobeys plans to launch an online grocery platform to Canada</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/sobeys-plans-to-launch-an-online-grocery-platform-to-canada/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/sobeys-plans-to-launch-an-online-grocery-platform-to-canada/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2018 16:00:27 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Sameer Chhabra]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[retail]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=127151</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Sobeys has announced that the company is partnering with British grocery giant Ocado to bring a \u201cbest in the world\u201d online grocery platform to...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>Sobeys has announced that the company is partnering with British grocery giant Ocado to bring a \u201cbest in the world\u201d online grocery platform to the Canadian market. </p>\n<p>The service, built upon the Ocado Smart Platform, will feature an end-to-end shopping solution incorporating online grocery ordering, automated fulfillment and home delivery.

Since the beginning of January we\u2019ve seen <a href=\"https://betakit.com/td-acquires-layer-6-in-canadian-ai-talent-grab/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">acquisitions</a>, significant leadership <a href=\"https://betakit.com/vincent-mifsud-steps-down-as-scribblelive-ceo-becomes-board-chair/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">moves</a> and <a href=\"https://betakit.com/wattpad-raises-61-25-million-to-continue-investment-in-machine-learning-interactive-storytelling/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">massive funding rounds</a>, and we shouldn\u2019t expect the excitement to wind down anytime soon. </p>\n<p>Some technologies and events that will continue to drive innovation and conversation this year include cryptocurrencies and the blockchain, the country\u2019s upcoming legalization of recreational marijuana, and the Liberal\u2019s proposed small business tax reform. While we\u2019ll only fully understand the impact these things have on the tech community as the year goes on, I\u2019ve laid out some predictions below.</p>\n<hr width=\"20%\" />\n<h3> There will be an adjustment in the price of most cryptocurrencies, but the blockchain will further secure its potential for decentralized transactions </h3>\n<p>There has been a lot of talk recently about the volatility of cryptocurrencies. The unprecedented growth of cryptoassets in 2017 has left people skeptical, and many financial advisors have taken to the media to urge both their clients and the public against such volatile investments. 2018 will see cryptocurrencies continue to grow, but they will also swing wildly in value. </p>\n<p>As cryptocurrencies grow, the blockchain will secure its status as the technology for decentralized transactions, and it will begin to disrupt industries and address real-world challenges such as payments, security, identity, and ownership management.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/esteban-lopez-346908.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/esteban-lopez-346908-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"cannabis\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-126897\" srcset=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/esteban-lopez-346908-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/esteban-lopez-346908-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/esteban-lopez-346908-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/esteban-lopez-346908-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/esteban-lopez-346908-296x197.jpg 296w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/esteban-lopez-346908-1050x700.jpg 1050w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/esteban-lopez-346908-870x580.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Not as many people will switch their marijuana buying habits to legitimate paths, as some of the stock prices seem to be betting on</h3>\n<p>Many Canadians are looking forward to summer 2018, when the nation will officially legalize the production, sale, and consumption of recreational marijuana. Last summer, cannabis stocks soared as investors anticipated the profits associated with a legalized distribution system, but by the end of the year stock prices had taken a turn for the worse as uncertainty about the demand for legal marijuana grew. This downward spiral will continue if regulated sales prices are higher than what consumers are currently paying \u2014 and that\u2019s what we\u2019re expecting.</p>\n<h3>Machine learning will continue to influence critical industries like manufacturing, automobiles and security </h3>\n<p>Machine learning and artificially intelligent technologies are already influencing many industries and verticals. These technologies will continue to improve and will be further adopted in 2018, with low-hanging fruit opportunities in the legal and financial verticals.</p>\n<p>I also believe that increased concern will be voiced about the social dislocation and economic upheaval experienced by increasing numbers of people left unemployed or underemployed. Amazon just opened its first cashier-less store, and driverless cars are already here. Many of these new applications will have an enormous negative impact on the people and families affected. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/federalbudget/2017/03/22/federal-budget-holds-the-line-on-liberal-priorities-olive.html\"><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/billmorneau3-1024x681.jpg\" alt=\"bill morneau\" width=\"690\" height=\"459\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-115147\" srcset=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/billmorneau3-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/billmorneau3-300x199.jpg 300w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/billmorneau3-768x511.jpg 768w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/billmorneau3-600x399.jpg 600w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/billmorneau3-296x197.jpg 296w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/billmorneau3-1050x700.jpg 1050w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/billmorneau3-872x580.jpg 872w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/billmorneau3.jpg 1086w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" /></a></p>\n<h3>The Liberal government will not end up shooting early-stage risk capital in the foot by implementing the unfair tax changes contemplated in the summer </h3>\n<p>In August 2017, the Liberal government announced their proposed business tax reform. The announcement was met with an <a href=\"https://betakit.com/canadas-proposed-tax-changes-will-stifle-investment-in-early-stage-startups/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">onslaught of criticism</a> from the Canadian small business and startup communities, and the debate continues to this day. </p>\n<p>The tax reform, if realized, would severely curtail early stage technology investment, compromising the supportive entrepreneurial culture that Canada has worked so hard to build. But I don\u2019t foresee the changes being made as is. </p>\n<p>The government will realize that making it tougher on small business entrepreneurs is not in the best interest of the country, particularly in consideration of moves being made by our neighbour to the south. This will be the year that the Liberal government finally wakes up to partnering with the small business and investment community rather than waging a misguided class warfare. There is too much at stake for all Canadians for reason not to prevail. </p>\n<h3>Canada will enjoy another stellar year in technology investments, mergers and exits </h3>\n<p>While this prediction may sound like a given, our tech community has seen many a lackluster year and Canada has not yet had its day in the sun. </p>\n<p>2018 will see Canada standing tall, with much wealth generated, and its ranking in the world of technology will continue to grow. In many ways, government intervention aside, the stars are aligned. We have several successful second and third time entrepreneurs giving back, capital is flowing, and we have the best engineering talent in the world. This is our time.</p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/bruce-croxons-predictions-for-the-canadian-tech-community-in-2018/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>2</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Dragons&#8217; Den announces audition tour for latest season</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/dragons-den-announces-audition-tour-for-latest-season/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/dragons-den-announces-audition-tour-for-latest-season/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2018 13:00:39 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=127107</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Dragons&#8217; Den is kicking off a cross-Canada tour seeking Canada&#8217;s next up-and-coming startups to pitch on the show.

Ok CanCon, play us your analysis.</p>\n<p>Speaking of analysis, Google wants to analyse your face, for free! Well, you get to know what famous piece of art you look like. What does Google get?</p>\n<p>Speaking of Google, the tech giant bought YouTube, the world&#8217;s second biggest search engine, just over ten years ago. In that time, the platform has moved from a user-generated content (UGC) haven to a place where Logan Paul happens. As the company cracks down on UGC content, we take a look at which changes are for the better, and which aren&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>Join us as the CanCon crew &#8211; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/erinbury\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Erin Bury</a>, Managing Director of <a href=\"http://eightyeightagency.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eighty-Eight</a>; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patrick_orourke\" target=\"_blank\">Patrick O&#8217;Rourke</a>, MobileSyrup Senior Editor; and  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tron\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Douglas Soltys</a>, BetaKit Editor-in-Chief &#8211; goes all new year, new you.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/387132860&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Subscribe via: <a href=\"http://betakit.libsyn.com/rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RSS</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/cancon-podcast/id1078453487\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/betakit-podcast-network/cancon-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"https://goo.gl/app/playmusic?ibi=com.google.PlayMusic&amp;isi=691797987&amp;ius=googleplaymusic&amp;link=https://play.google.com/music/m/Ipd47gijhafpyqci6kjk5oownqa?t%3DCanCon_Podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Play</a></p>\n<p>Brought to you by CanCon&#8217;s presenting sponsor: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DellSmbCA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dell</a></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-116805\" src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dell-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Dell Canada\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dell-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dell-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dell.jpg 600w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dell-580x580.jpg 580w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dell-180x180.jpg 180w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p>Also brought to you by: <a href=\"https://www.tunnelbear.com/cancon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TunnelBear</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tunnelbear.com/cancon\"><img src=\"https://betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/header_logo_blue@2x.png\" alt=\"TunnelBear logo\" width=\"484\" height=\"64\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-126457\" srcset=\"https://betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/header_logo_blue@2x.png 484w, https://betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/header_logo_blue@2x-300x40.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Go <a href=\"https://www.tunnelbear.com/cancon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> to try TunnelBear for free!

A DAICO project can be published by the development team behind the ICO, and starts off in contribution mode, so anyone can contribute ETH to the contract and receive tokens back. </p>\n<p>After the contribution, a mechanism called &#8216;tap&#8217; allows token holders to control how much funding goes to the dev team. Set by the team at the launch the DAICO contract, the team can request to raise the tap value if they need more resources. Token holders can also vote to shut the contract down entirely and receive their money back. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The intention is that the voters start off by giving the development team a reasonable and not-too-high monthly budget, and raise it over time as the team demonstrates its ability to competently execute with its existing budget,&#8221; he writes. </p>\n<p><em>Photo via <a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/vitalik-buterin-face-blockchain/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Invest in Blockchain</a></em></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/ethereum-founder-vitalik-buterin-proposes-model-to-minimize-risk-in-icos/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Toronto seeking residents&#8217; ideas for Smart Cities Challenge proposal</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/toronto-seeking-residents-ideas-for-smart-cities-challenge-proposal/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/toronto-seeking-residents-ideas-for-smart-cities-challenge-proposal/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 19:24:55 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=127057</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The city of Toronto announced that it&#8217;s participating in the federal Smart Cities Challenge, and is inviting the public to share ideas on how...]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>The city of Toronto announced that it&#8217;s participating in the federal Smart Cities Challenge, and is inviting the public to share ideas on how tech can improve life in Toronto. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The city has done a lot of work to leverage data and technology to help improve the quality of life in Toronto,&#8221; said mayor John Tory. &#8220;The Smart Cities Challenge provides us with an incredible opportunity to help make Toronto a smarter city.

A list of finalists will be released in Summer 2018, and a judging committee will award these individuals $250,000 to develop their proposals.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Smart city initiatives can improve all aspects of livability and opportunity in a city,&#8221; said Michael Kolm, the City&#8217;s Chief Transformation Officer. &#8220;We&#8217;re committed to improving public services \u2013 now and in the future \u2013 and the Smart Cities Challenge will help to inspire new smart approaches to make a difference in Toronto.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The city has leveraged tech to streamline its processes and experiences in the past; in November 2017, it <a href=\"https://betakit.com/city-of-toronto-partners-with-waze-to-improve-citys-traffic-awareness/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">partnered with Waze to improve the city&#8217;s traffic awareness</a>, and its DineSafe portal provides restaurant food inspection results from the past two years. </p>\n<p>Cities can find more information on submitting ideas <a href=\"https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/get-involved/smart-cities-challenge/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, which are due by February 2.  </p>\n<p><em>Photo via <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/gOq27RHoL3s\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></em></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/toronto-seeking-residents-ideas-for-smart-cities-challenge-proposal/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>R&#124;T: The Retail Times &#8211; The Amazon shortlist</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/rt-the-retail-times-the-amazon-shortlist/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/rt-the-retail-times-the-amazon-shortlist/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 17:00:06 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Amira Zubairi]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[retail]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=127039</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The Retail Times is a weekly newsletter covering retail tech news from Canada and around the globe.

Actua\u2019s funding will be used to increase coding program delivery across Canada by its 35 network member programs located at universities and colleges, and its Outreach Team which delivers across the North.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Coding is the next big job. Industries ranging from automotive and agri-food to the life sciences and<br />\nclean technology need coders, given their increasingly digital nature,&#8221; said Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development. &#8220;That\u2019s why our government is equipping Canadian youth with the digital skills they need for the jobs of the future. By teaching kids to code today, we\u2019re positioning Canada for future success across all industries and sectors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Actua said it will engage a total of\u200b 500,000 youth across every province and territory, and its CanCode funding will be matched by several of its corporate supporters including Google Canada and Microsoft.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe&#8217;re thrilled to see an investment in programs that will nurture the next generation of Canada&#8217;s technology builders,&#8221; said Sabrina Geremia, country director at Google. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we support Actua through our Codemakers program, which has helped hundreds of thousands of young Canadians learn about the technology that is shaping our world. We need more students pursuing an education in computer science, particularly those who have historically been underrepresented in the field, and today\u2019s announcement will help make that a reality. Computer Science is not the language of ones and zeros. It&#8217;s the language of creativity, entrepreneurship and potential.&#8221;</p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/coding-non-profit-actua-receives-10-million-from-governments-cancode-program/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>BDC report: Canadian businesses plan to invest $140.5 billion in their growth this year</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/bdc-report-canadian-businesses-plan-to-invest-140-5-billion-in-their-growth-this-year/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/bdc-report-canadian-businesses-plan-to-invest-140-5-billion-in-their-growth-this-year/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 14:00:42 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Technology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[report]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=126981</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Small and medium-sized businesses plan to invest $140.5 billion in their companies this year to sustain growth, according to a report from BDC.

This is BDC\u2019s third annual study of SME investment intentions, and the data is based on a survey conducted last August and September by the research firm SOM. In total, 4,019 business owners participated.</p>\n<p>The upswing is due largely to a surge in business acquisition plans, a long-expected trend driven by Canada\u2019s aging population and the retirement of baby boomer entrepreneurs. Business owners expect to spend 79 percent more on acquiring other businesses in 2018, or $18.9 billion, up from $10.6 billion in 2017.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe findings are very encouraging because SME investment is critical to Canada\u2019s economic health,\u201d says Pierre Cl\u00e9roux, Vice President, Research and Chief Economist at BDC. \u201cThese businesses make up 99.7 percent of all Canadian companies. When they invest, they become more productive and competitive and can offer higher wages and benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p>British Columbia and the territories (17 percent planned investment increase), Alberta (up 12 percent) and Quebec (up 11 percent) have the brightest investment outlooks, while Ontario businesses expect to trim investments by one percent in 2018 and other regions anticipate steeper drops. As for specific investments, businesses say that spending on R&#038;D and employee training will rise by a total of $2.4 billion this year.</p>\n<p>Sustaining growth was the top-cited reason for investing in businesses, followed by boosting the value of the business and keeping pace with the competition. Among sectors, technology (up eight percent) and services (up seven percent) show the highest growth in investment intentions, while manufacturing is flat and a decline is expected in the construction and resources sector (down 14 percent).</p>\n<p>Lack of funds generated by the business and risks associated with investment projects are other leading reasons for not investing.</p>\n<p>Photo via <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/npxXWgQ33ZQ\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/bdc-report-canadian-businesses-plan-to-invest-140-5-billion-in-their-growth-this-year/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>CIRA offering $1 million in grants to organizations that increase internet safety</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/cira-offering-1-million-in-grants-to-organizations-that-increase-internet-safety/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/cira-offering-1-million-in-grants-to-organizations-that-increase-internet-safety/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 13:00:10 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Sameer Chhabra]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[impact]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=126969</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The not-for-profit in charge of maintaining the \u2018.Ca\u2019 domain has announced $1 million CAD in community funding.

It aggregates top Canadian AI news, pulling stories from media partners like BetaKit, Techvibes and Digital Journal, and Canadian publications like The Globe and Mail. Canada.ai will also feature posts directly from Canada&#8217;s AI researchers and institutes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no secret that artificial intelligence in Canada has reached a tipping point, and it&#8217;s more important than ever that we as Canadians shine a spotlight on our stories,&#8221; said Graham Taylor, Academic Director of NextAI and Associate Professor of Engineering at the University of Guelph and the Vector Institute. &#8220;The platform is a place for everyone in the AI community to share and take pride in our accomplishments.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Canada.ai also features a comprehensive directory of the organizations researching, developing, and commercializing AI in the space. It will also include a timeline of the history of AI in Canada. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Canada is home to several of the world&#8217;s most advanced AI organizations and companies, operating across the country from Montreal to Vancouver,&#8221; said Jean-Francois Gagn\u00e9, co-founder and CEO of Element AI. &#8220;Canada.ai provides a space to celebrate all of those organizations and highlight wins as a community.

Based in San Francisco, Iris Automation was founded by University of British Columbia engineering grads. Its system includes an embedded computing platform combined with a high-resolution, vision-based sensing package, allowing for the detection of moving objects such as Cessna airplanes at ranges of 1500 feet, or 500m.  Once detected, Iris Automation&#8217;s system maneuver the drones or other flying robots safely away from collision trajectories. </p>\n<p>\u201cIris Automation\u2019s approach to sensing is unlike anything ever attempted in the autonomous vehicle space,\u201d said Alexander Harmsen, CEO at Iris Automation. \u201cOur team of experts in computer vision, machine learning, and traditional aviation have built a product that will provide the level of safety necessary for pushing the boundaries of what is possible with drones, at a size factor and price point unheard of in the world of aviation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Iris&#8217; team includes expertise from NASA, Boeing, and PhDs in computer vision. The company plans to use the investment to expand its engineering team in San Francisco and Reno-Tahoe, and to scale the technology to participate in the upcoming White House UAS Integration Pilot Projects.</p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/iris-automation-raises-10-million-series-a-to-help-drones-avoid-collisions/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Globalive Technology Partners and Nuuvera using blockchain to ensure safety in cannabis products</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/globalive-technology-partners-and-nuuvera-using-blockchain-to-ensure-safety-in-cannabis-products/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/globalive-technology-partners-and-nuuvera-using-blockchain-to-ensure-safety-in-cannabis-products/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2018 20:10:54 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Galang]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[FinTech]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toronto]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=126885</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Globalive Technology Partners has announced that it is working with Brampton, Ontario-based Nuuvera, which is working on commercial production and distribution of medical-grade cannabis....]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag' style='margin-bottom: 35px;'></h4><p>Globalive Technology Partners has announced that it is working with Brampton, Ontario-based <a href=\"http://www.nuuvera.com/en\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nuuvera</a>, which is working on commercial production and distribution of medical-grade cannabis. </p>\n<p>Launched this month by Wind Mobile founder Tony Lacavera, GTP <a href=\"https://betakit.com/globalives-anthony-lacavera-wants-to-undergo-ipo-for-blockchain-firm-by-mid-2018/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">forms partnerships</a> with companies looking to use blockchain to improve their processes. </p>\n<p>Nuuvera is developing software for increasing the safety and security of records, and helping supply chain management globally.

Ultimately, Uber and Quebec\u2019s provincial government were able to work out a compromise that resulted in the company <a href=\"https://mobilesyrup.com/2017/10/13/uber-says-willing-negotiate-wont-leave-quebec/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">staying in the province</a>, while simultaneously sitting back down at the negotiating table. </p>\n<p>And that was all before news got out that hackers in 2016 had been able to access 57 million user accounts in the US. and 815,000 user accounts in Canada \u2014 <a href=\"https://mobilesyrup.com/2017/11/21/uber-concealed-cyberattack-affected-57-million-customers-year/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a cybersecurity incident</a> that Kalanick allegedly attempted to hide by paying approximately $100,000, but that eventually came to light in 2017. </p>\n<p>Now, Rob Khazzam \u2014 Uber Canada\u2019s newest general manager \u2014 says he sees a key opportunity for the ride-sharing giant to be a more constructive partner to cities, to its riders and drivers, and improve its strained public relationship. </p>\n<h3> The young executive, a company man and not-so-ancient history</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/uber-canada-visit-4-1024x712.jpg\" alt=\"uber canada\" width=\"690\" height=\"480\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-126873\" srcset=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/uber-canada-visit-4-1024x712.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/uber-canada-visit-4-300x209.jpg 300w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/uber-canada-visit-4-768x534.jpg 768w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/uber-canada-visit-4-600x417.jpg 600w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/uber-canada-visit-4-834x580.jpg 834w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" /></p>\n<p>Relaxed, refined and eloquent, Khazzam\u2019s presence resonates and clearly puts people at ease. </p>\n<p>Before sitting down for an interview, for example, he checks his schedule on his phone and matter-of-factly states that he doesn\u2019t want to be the kind of boss who shows up late to meetings with employees. At 31-years-old, Khazzam\u2019s also quite young \u2014 though, he\u2019s not without experience. As the former general manager of Uber in Central Europe and Eastern Europe, as well as the international launcher of Uber\u2019s operations in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, Khazzam\u2019s been with the company since 2014 \u2014 three years before some of Uber\u2019s worst press coverage.</p>\n<p>Impressively, Khazzam is quick to acknowledge some of his company\u2019s worst shortcomings \u2014 including the perception that the company wasn\u2019t willing to compromise with regulators. </p>\n<p>\u201cI think Uber\u2026were perceived as a bit confrontational and aggressive and not really great at explaining ourselves,\u201d says Khazzam, to a pool of reporters gathered at Uber Canada\u2019s King Street offices. \u201cWe were building so quickly, we didn\u2019t stop to explain to press, the ministry of transport\u2026what is the opportunity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn hindsight, that was something we all know we could do better.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/01/19/uber-canadas-new-general-manager-wants-to-put-more-people-into-fewer-cars/\"><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/uber-canada-visit-1-1024x701.jpg\" alt=\"uber canada\" width=\"690\" height=\"472\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-126851\" srcset=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/uber-canada-visit-1-1024x701.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/uber-canada-visit-1-300x205.jpg 300w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/uber-canada-visit-1-768x526.jpg 768w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/uber-canada-visit-1-600x411.jpg 600w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/uber-canada-visit-1-847x580.jpg 847w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Khazzam also doesn\u2019t shy away from the allegations of workplace harassment levied against Uber, stating that the company has since implemented mandatory sexual harassment training. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat was not a Canada topic, that was a global topic,\u201d says Khazzam. </p>\n<p>He reiterates that the company has published \u201cstrict guidelines and policies\u201d aimed at improving Uber\u2019s allegedly toxic workplace environment. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve rolled out manager training across the company, not just on the topic of workplace harassment, but generally on what it means to be a manager \u2014 what it means to recognize issues that are reported and make sure that they\u2019re actioned,\u201d says Khazzam.</p>\n<p>According to Khazzam, Uber discovered that 60 percent of its executives were first-time managers.

UberPOOL collects two or more passengers going to different destinations along a similar path and minimizes the cost of the trip by splitting it across multiple people.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/01/19/uber-canadas-new-general-manager-wants-to-put-more-people-into-fewer-cars/\"><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/uber-canada-visit-6-1024x629.jpg\" alt=\"uber canada\" width=\"690\" height=\"424\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-126861\" srcset=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/uber-canada-visit-6-1024x629.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/uber-canada-visit-6-300x184.jpg 300w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/uber-canada-visit-6-768x472.jpg 768w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/uber-canada-visit-6-600x369.jpg 600w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/uber-canada-visit-6-944x580.jpg 944w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" /></a></p>\n<p>In a way, UberPOOL might be the company\u2019s most literal interpretation of ride-sharing. </p>\n<p>\u201cFor me, I think of that as a real win-win opportunity,\u201d says Khazzam. \u201cRiders get a cheaper price, drivers get more of fee-paying passengers in the backseat, and for the city and for people who live here, we\u2019re really hopefully getting more people in fewer cars.\u201d </p>\n<p>Of course, Khazzam doesn\u2019t hide the fact that he also wants more Canadian cities covered by Uber.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/01/19/uber-canadas-new-general-manager-wants-to-put-more-people-into-fewer-cars/\"><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/uber-rob-khazzam-body-image-1024x716.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"482\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-126867\" srcset=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/uber-rob-khazzam-body-image-1024x716.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/uber-rob-khazzam-body-image-300x210.jpg 300w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/uber-rob-khazzam-body-image-768x537.jpg 768w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/uber-rob-khazzam-body-image-600x420.jpg 600w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/uber-rob-khazzam-body-image-829x580.jpg 829w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" /></a></p>\n<p>\u201cToday, 80 percent of our business sits in Ontario and we\u2019re really excited about what that means for Ontario and how much it\u2019s grown and there\u2019s a lot of opportunity ahead,\u201d says Khazzam. \u201cIt\u2019s not lost on us that we\u2019ve got a number of\u2026provinces and a huge chunk of the population that still wants access to Uber and Manitoba, Saskatchewan and British Columbia are provinces that are having active discussions about regulating ride-sharing at different stages and we\u2019re doing our part.\u201d </p>\n<p>What this means is that Uber is actively involved in talks with provincial regulators to convince the provincial governments that ride-sharing won\u2019t eat away from existing transportation industries. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe only operate in markets where Uber is regulated, we\u2019re not the regulator, that\u2019s not our place,\u201d says Khazzam. \u201cOur job is to make sure we\u2019re a constructive partner at the table and my hope is that in 2018, we\u2019ll see progress in those provinces and that one day people of Winnipeg, people of Vancouver and these various cities \u2014 these great cities of Canada \u2014 are all gonna have access to Uber as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a lofty goal \u2014 a seemingly Herculean challenge, especially in the face of the company\u2019s potential appearance to the public. </p>\n<p>Suffice it to say, it\u2019s a challenge that the company is more than positioned to accept, and one that Khazzam seems well-equipped to handle. </p>\n<p>However, time will only tell if Uber is able to recover from an exceptionally turbulent 2017.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/01/19/uber-canadas-new-general-manager-wants-to-put-more-people-into-fewer-cars/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MobileSyrup</a>.

Each week, investors tackle the tough questions facing founders today. Have a question you would like answered? Tweet them with the #askaninvestor hashtag, or email them <a href=\"mailto:askaninvestor@betakit.com\" target=\"_top\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<hr width=\"20%\" />\n<p>Amazon made a splash went it <a href=\"https://betakit.com/toronto-only-canadian-city-to-make-amazonhq2-shortlist/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">put out a call for municipal HQ2 bids</a>, but opening a satellite office is nothing new for modern tech companies. Talent is the most important, and scarcest, resource for startups \u2014 the difference between success and stagnation is the caliber of team you\u2019re able to attract. In the search for this talent, startups often expand into another geography to attract experienced salespeople, designers, marketers, and developers. But attracting those employees is the easy part \u2014 retaining and managing remote office workers is where it gets tough.</p>\n<p>I know this first-hand, as I joined iNovia as a remote worker. We have a distributed team model, with employees in six cities, three time zones, and two countries. Maintaining a cohesive work culture as you expand beyond one office will depend on your unique company values, the number and size of offices, and the seniority of those employees. However, the specifics will all be governed by two core principles &#8211; transparency and inclusion.</p>\n<h3> Transparency</h3>\n<p>As whiteboards become <a href=\"https://www.klipfolio.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">digital dashboards</a>, it\u2019s easy to assume that everyone on the team is on the same page about company health and strategy. In my experience, you should consciously set up all work processes to revolve around shared tools. Google Drive is an easy and affordable toolset; we build budgets and forecasts in Sheets, work on job postings and investment theses in Docs; and draft a marketing schedule in Calendar. Trello or equivalent tools are great for task management, shared Wunderlist lists keep everyone aligned on to-dos, and shared Evernote or Dropbox folders keep working notes organized.</p>\n<blockquote><p>An important principle here is openness: since we can\u2019t physically call a coworker over to our laptop screen or show them our schedule at a glance, we default to open settings that let teammates stay aware without waiting for permission.</p></blockquote>\n<p>An important principle here is openness: since we can\u2019t physically call a coworker over to our laptop screen or show them our schedule at a glance, we default to open settings that let teammates stay aware without waiting for permission. We also keep calendars open, so people can easily book meetings without extensive back-and-forths (and so it\u2019s obvious when a coworker in a different time zone is at a school recital or family dinner).</p>\n<p>There are great purpose-built tools to track and manage the key inputs that drive your business model. Startups and new investments are our life-blood, so we invest extra in <a href=\"https://affinity.co/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Affinity</a>, a VC-specific CRM that puts collaboration front and centre. </p>\n<p>For a sales-oriented company, a proposal management tool like <a href=\"https://www.pandadoc.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">PandaDoc</a> might be a better investment. If time zones make weekly stand-ups challenging to schedule, consider tools for goal setting. An OKR platform like <a href=\"https://www.perdoo.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Perdoo</a> keeps your whole team aligned on quarterly company objectives, how objectives for each team member (or department) feed into those top-line objectives, and how the team\u2019s key results are tracking against them. </p>\n<h3> Inclusion </h3>\n<p>Humans are social creatures, and we value inclusion not just for the chance to be part of a group, but also for how we feel it reflects people\u2019s opinions of us. Given the emotional dynamics at play, aim for over-communication and nailing the little things.</p>\n<h3> Set everyone up with the tech basics</h3>\n<blockquote><p>Culture is defined by the daily actions we take, rather than a written statement.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Remote offices don\u2019t always have an office manager, but make sure that your employees feel equipped. Second screens, keyboards, and mouses can get forgotten, but have a huge impact on turning a small WeWork desk into an office space. </p>\n<p>Chat software, remote meeting software, tele-presence devices, separate webcams, and access to a private conference room make communication seamless and help bridge the miles between offices.</p>\n<h3> Aim for equality of events</h3>\n<p>Free breakfasts or lunches, afternoons off to volunteer, fireside chats with senior management and/or special guests &#8211; these are all perks that companies will occasionally schedule at HQ to keep employees engaged and celebrate company milestones. Anything that\u2019s scheduled for HQ should be happening at HQ2 &#8211; deliver breakfast to all your locations, and stream your guest presentations to remote workers.</p>\n<h3> Audio/video > Slack > email</h3>\n<p>Facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice play a huge role in communication. Aim to pick up the phone or video call \u2014 it\u2019s typically faster and less prone to miscommunication. When Slacking or emailing coworkers, accept that there\u2019s a higher chance they\u2019ll agonize over hidden subtext or misinterpret tone.</p>\n<p>Some of our portfolio companies have taken this a step further, with a permanent live video feed running from all the offices so people can see their coworkers and what they\u2019re doing. Even on mute, it\u2019s nice to see that your coworkers are real people who are all part of the same team.</p>\n<h3> Celebrate the positive</h3>\n<p>Feedback tends to shrink for remote workers. Picking up the phone or sending a feedback email can feel overly formal, meaning it slowly becomes a tool only used for constructive criticism that needs to get delivered.</p>\n<p>Positive recognition often happens verbally and informally. If an employee can\u2019t physically ring the sales bell in front of the whole team, or get called out during a Friday afternoon debrief, circulate an email recognizing them to their peers to make sure feedback isn\u2019t disproportionately critical.</p>\n<h3> Encourage random conversations</h3>\n<p>When you\u2019re working from a secondary office, you tend to miss out on \u201crandom collisions\u201d that otherwise happen when all employees are housed together. Without a water cooler to cluster around, or a hallway to bump into colleagues in, informal conversations and spontaneous collaboration fall by the wayside. </p>\n<p>We have a #random channel in Slack where people are encouraged to post the topics that are dominating their mindshare, which would otherwise come out in those informal conversations.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/climate-kic-350836-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"team\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-114939\" srcset=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/climate-kic-350836-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/climate-kic-350836-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/climate-kic-350836-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/climate-kic-350836-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/climate-kic-350836-296x197.jpg 296w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/climate-kic-350836-1050x700.jpg 1050w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/climate-kic-350836-870x580.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" /></p>\n<h3> Schedule together time</h3>\n<p>Once a quarter, my team hosts full team retreats, where we all spend a few days in the same city to set our strategy, prioritize our goals for the quarter, and spend quality time over meals and adrenaline-pumping activities. </p>\n<p>Individual team members aim to visit coworkers in other cities every month, nurturing those individual relationships and checking in on relevant projects in person. The cadence that\u2019s right for your firm will depend on the size and seniority of your remote employees. The more senior an employee, the more time they typically spend travelling. Don\u2019t restrict travel to your one remote VP \u2014 the executive team should occasionally travel to other offices, focusing on engaging with the team there, understanding the pulse of the office, and hosting fireside chats or all-hands meetings to replicate the exposure to senior management that employees at HQ naturally get.</p>\n<h3>Get conscious of time zones</h3>\n<p>Remote workers tend to work longer days. They schedule a full work day with clients, co-workers and partners in their same time zone, but frequently get scheduled into off-hours meetings with team members in other geographies. Pay extra attention to bandwidth and burnout for cross-geography teams, especially when most of the team members work in the same time zone. </p>\n<p>Encourage employees to block off personal time to serve as a deterrent for meetings scheduled outside of working hours.</p>\n<h3> Respect time zones</h3>\n<p>Block off holidays in your master calendar and respect that employees in Ontario will be taking Family Day a week later than employees in BC. Encourage a culture where people take the holidays as they occur, rather than banking an extra PTO day. Holidays are about more than the time away from work &#8211; they\u2019re typically community or family events, and an extra day of vacation is a poor reward for working through a Memorial Day neighbourhood event.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, get creative! Culture is defined by the daily actions we take, rather than a written statement. Employees at all levels of the organization can impact the relationship between different offices, and whatever empowers your team to feel satisfied with a remote work model is the right strategy for you.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4> Christian&#8217;s take:</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/christianlassonde150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Christian Lassonde\" width=\"175\" height=\"175\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-50164\" /> </p>\n<p>Almost every company in tech today has at least one member who works at least part of the time virtually. Impression Ventures is no exception. Our head office is in Toronto, but we have a satellite office in Montreal. It\u2019s a good reminder that even if you don\u2019t think of your company as using a distributed team model, you likely have members who aren\u2019t at the head office.</p>\n<p>If that\u2019s the case, Sarah\u2019s best practices above all still very much apply. It\u2019s a good corporate New Years resolution to take stock of where all your employees are based out of. Even if you only have one or two employees who work part-time virtually, consider carefully if they are being treated as full equal coworkers to your head office staff.

Tech \u2014 and customer needs \u2014 change quick. Here are the companies that you should watch for in 2018 as they keep one step ahead of ever evolving markets.</p>\n<hr width=20%\">\n<h3> SSIMWAVE</h3>\n<p>Video streaming accounts for over 70 percent of internet traffic \u2014 and that number is expected to skyrocket towards the end of the decade. HD on your iPhone X on LTE needs a different quality stream then your Samsung tablet on food court WiFi. Emmy-award winner <a href=\"https://www.ssimwave.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SSIMWAVE</a> (yes, they won an Emmy in 2015 for their technology) has developed the world\u2019s first real-time viewer intelligence platform; they\u2019ve literally put the human visual system in software. It\u2019s technology that helps distributors, networks, and studios reduce the amount of bandwidth needed to deliver the best perceivable quality video \u2014 anywhere and on any device. </p>\n<p>The SSIMWAVE platform helps by determining what the viewer will see on the device and connection they are on, and then sends the appropriate stream. Founded in 2013, SSIMWAVE has seen rapid growth in the last 14 months, they have gone from 7 employees to 40 in Waterloo and 2 in the USA. They\u2019re graduates of the <a href=\"http://acceleratorcentre.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Accelerator Centre\u2019s Accelerator Program</a> and <a href=\"https://www.communitech.ca/how-we-help/support-for-startups/communitech-rev/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Communitech\u2019s Rev Sale Accelerator</a>. In 2017, they added Steve McCartney as President and Saj Jamal as VP of Marketing in 2017 and moved into the former Maluba offices in Waterloo. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our co-founders are Primetime Engineering Emmy Award Winners!<a href=\"https://t.co/g5zjQjlNpr\">https://t.co/g5zjQjlNpr</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/sVWns8N0mk\">pic.twitter.com/sVWns8N0mk</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; SSIMWAVE Inc.

But for tech, I\u2019d say the best kept secret is whatever the team at <a href=\"https://www.thalmic.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Thalmic Labs</a> is working on. </p>\n<p>They raised a <a href=\"https://betakit.com/thalmic-labs-raises-158-million-cad-series-b/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$158 million CAD series B</a> in September of 2016, and have had the proverbial and literal blinds down working on their next product. They\u2019ve been on a hiring spree since then, and they\u2019ll have three buildings across Waterloo Region this year. Last January, they <a href=\"https://betakit.com/thalmic-labs-opening-factory-in-waterloo-dedicated-to-building-its-next-wearable-device/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">opened their new manufacturing facility in Waterloo</a> and are in the final stages of opening a renovated second office next to their main facility on Charles Street in downtown Kitchener. What are they making? When is it coming to market? We might find out in 2018.</p>\n<p><em><br />\n(Quick disclosure: I worked at Thalmic Labs from February 2014 to August 2015 on the Myo armband, and one of their product managers side hustles as the DJ at our holiday parties. I have no idea what they\u2019re building because I don\u2019t like spoilers.)</em></p>\n<h3> Kiite </h3>\n<p>If you were going to put money on a startup in 2018, I\u2019d take the over on Waterloo-based <a href=\"https://kiite.ai\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kiite</a>. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The goal with Kiite is the give your employees the tools they need to be more autonomous and empowered. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Founded by local legend Joseph Fung, Kiite is building an intelligent sales enablement platform. Fung previously founded TribeHR which he sold to Netsuite in 2013 &#8211; which he then grew into a major office for Netsuite as VP of Human Capital Management until founding Kiite last year. If you work at a SaaS company, you know that finding, training and retaining great salespeople is a challenge. </p>\n<p>The goal with Kiite is the give your employees the tools they need to be more autonomous and empowered. Kiite\u2019s chatbot provides intelligent, real-time, accurate feedback to help your employees close deals quickly. </p>\n<h3> Meya.ai</h3>\n<p>Companies are betting on chatbots being the future of customer service &#8211; but your customers aren\u2019t all on the same platform. <a href=\"https://meya.ai\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Meya.ai</a> makes this simpler for you by letting you develop bots that work across multiple platforms. They support everything from Messenger to Twitter, WeChat to Slack and almost everything else in between. </p>\n<p>Founders Erik Kalviainen and Amanie Ismail have started to grow the company in Kitchener after completing a <a href=\"https://betakit.com/seven-canadian-companies-among-batch-21-of-500-startups-seed-program/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cohort in 500 Startups</a> in 2017. They recently added Rachel Pautler, former co-founder of Suncayr, to their team as Sales and Marketing Manager.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_126791\" style=\"max-width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_20180116_1558241.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_20180116_1558241-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"kitchener-waterloo\" width=\"690\" height=\"518\" class=\"size-large wp-image-126791\" srcset=\"https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_20180116_1558241-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_20180116_1558241-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_20180116_1558241-768x576.jpg 768w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_20180116_1558241-600x450.jpg 600w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_20180116_1558241-773x580.jpg 773w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: David Hussey</p></div>\n<h3> Miovision</h3>\n<p>2018 is growth year for smart city tech leader <a href=\"https://miovision.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Miovision</a>.

As urban migration continues and new technologies emerge, we\u2019re looking to make improvements to the built environment that will ultimately benefit the people and communities who live and work within it every day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shortlisted applicants will be announced in February, and successful entrants will receive technology, support, and expertise from Microsoft and Intel to be coached through the development of business plans for their pilots. Five to ten outstanding innovators will be selected, with pilot to be run exclusively in QuadReal office buildings in the downtown core and with the City of Toronto. Selected projects can also expect to receive additional in-kind support from Fasken, Toronto Hydro, and Communitech.</p>\n<p>Applications are open until February 11. </p>\n<div id='pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg'></div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://betakit.com/torontos-upplift-pilot-program-seeking-tech-solutions-for-city-infrastructure-challenges/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>S&#124;W: The SaaS Weekly &#8211; 30 billion views, 60 billion dollars</title>\n\t\t<link>https://betakit.com/sw-the-saas-weekly-30-billion-views-60-billion-dollars/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://betakit.com/sw-the-saas-weekly-30-billion-views-60-billion-dollars/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2018 12:00:22 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Amira Zubairi]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Startup News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[saas]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://betakit.com/?p=126609</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The SaaS Weekly is a weekly newsletter covering major SaaS news from Canada and around the globe.
