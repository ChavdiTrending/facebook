He says the best thing about his job is being able to surprise customers with the unusual ways you can use the products.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Whether you&#8217;re using a balsamic in a beer cocktail to turn it into a Radler or an olive oil on your shoes to take the scuffs out, I love when someone comes in for a bread dipper or a salad dressing and they leave with something they can use in their yogurts or even their hair,&#8221; he says.</p>\n<p>The goal is to personalize the shopping experience for each customer in hopes making them feel like a connoisseur, and creating a passion for the products and food in general.</p>\n<p>Jackson regularly brings out popcorn, a simple dip or even non-alcoholic beer for customers to help show them how easy it is to elevate something from simple to magical with a product they would never expect.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8220;One expects a vinegar drink to taste like floor cleaner,&#8221; he laughs. &#8220;And a lot of people are surprised when it&#8217;s pleasantly tart, sweet and not overly acidic.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For inspiration, the best place to start is at the store&#8217;s after-hours tasting parties, which consist of a seven-course tapas meal specifically designed for seven guests. Each course showcases an aged balsamic vinegar and a premium extra virgin olive oil \u2014 for only $10 per person.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8220;This way you get to try anything you want on a wide menu of just the weirdest things sometimes, and when you fall in love with it \u2014 not if \u2014 when you fall in love with it, you can take it home and recreate the experience yourself.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Oliv Tasting Room</strong></p>\n<p>Owner: Heila Rheeder<br />\nAddress:&nbsp;726 Broadway Ave<br />\nHours: Monday to Saturday at 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.&nbsp;<br />\nPhone:&nbsp;306-974-2840<br />\nWebsite:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://olivtr.com/en-ca/\">olivtr.com</a><br />\nCheck <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/olivtastingroomsaskatoon/\">Facebook</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/olivtastingroom/\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Erin Petrow is a reporter at The StarPhoenix.

Monson died on Jan. 2, 2018, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chose a new leader, Russell M. Nelson, formerly President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.</p>\n<p>Nelson is a world-renowned heart surgeon who left his medical career 34 years ago to serve the Mormon Church.</p>\n<p>The LDS church is organized geographically into congregations called stakes, a term taken from Old Testament tent imagery in which the tent or church is held up by supporting stakes. The leader of a stake is Stake President.</p>\n<p>Doug Robertson is the Saskatoon LDS Stake President and John Spencer is his Counsellor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The hierarchy of the LDS church as a pyramid with the President at the top,&#8221; Spencer says. &#8220;The President has the designation of Prophet and serves with two Counsellors or advisers under him. This three-man body supervises the work of the entire Church in all matters of policy, organization and administration.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Beneath the prophet is a council or Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. When a presiding President dies, the most senior Apostle (calculated by years of service rather than age) becomes President of the Church.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There was no jockeying or lobbying for the position,&#8221; Spencer says. &#8220;Any person wanting the position won&#8217;t be the one to get it. There&#8217;s a great manifestation of trust.&#8221;</p>\n<p>All 16 million Mormons worldwide knew who the next president would be.</p>\n<p>Nelson is almost 94. He joined the Church at age 16, &#8220;which technically makes him a convert,&#8221; Spencer says. &#8220;And he has a Saskatoon connection.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There are more than 3,000 LDS stakes worldwide, with nine congregations in the north half of Saskatchewan and 13 in the south. Once a year a conference is held which is presided over by one of the brethren from Salt Lake. The representative spends many hours in consultation with local leadership setting goals and action plans to achieve those goals, plus determining needed supports.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_375350\" style=\"max-width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2018/02/mormon-president.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"375350\" data-permalink=\"http://thestarphoenix.com/life/relationships/religion-new-mormon-leader-has-saskatoon-ties/attachment/mormon-president-jpg/#main\" data-orig-file=\"http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2018/02/mormon-president.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1000,750\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;AP&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS-1D X&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;President Russell M.

Through prayer and revelation he picks those who will be given leadership opportunities based on upward streaming and impressions when interacting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mormons in Saskatoon got to know President Nelson when he was an elder and came to Saskatchewan in 2001 at a critical time for the Saskatoon stake. The status of the congregation status was about to be downgraded because people were leaving and numbers were dwindling. Regina was the main stake and a proposal was in place to make Saskatoon a congregation within the Regina district.</p>\n<p>Nelson met with local leadership and spent time interviewing members, and recommended the status of stake remain in place.</p>\n<p>Spencer remembers Nelson as being a very perceptive person. &#8220;When he looked at me, I felt he was looking at the front of my backbone. But he was very kind.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A brief bio refers to Nelson as an internationally renowned, groundbreaking cardiovascular surgeon and researcher who gave it all up when he was called by the Church to become an Apostle. The father of 10 served in the Korean War as a medic, then studied at a Harvard hospital. He performed the first open-heart surgery in Utah.</p>\n<p>As a high school student, Nelson signed up for football, but he didn&#8217;t want his hands to get stepped on. His coach, no doubt annoyed with his reluctance, kept him on the bench. Later in life, Nelson would use the hands he was so keen to protect to perform surgery on his former coach.</p>\n<p>In his inaugural address to Church membership he touched on three main things: dedicated, intentional parenting; being covenant-keeping people; and his intention to serve with fullness of heart to the last breath in his body.</p>\n<p>Spencer says the LDS Church is growing so fast that leadership is beginning to shift. &#8220;When I was a kid, most members were American or Canadian. As the church has grown, we&#8217;re seeing many Africans and Asians joining, and we&#8217;re seeing a multinational approach to church issues.&#8221;</p>\n<p>What does he think Russell&#8217;s global influence will be?</p>\n<p>&#8220;President Russell is well-connected in China and Eastern Europe. He was the person who designated Kazakhstan to be opened to missions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He has a very strong character and is tremendously popular. He is able to mix love for the individual with rigidity of the doctrine, and has led an outreach to sisters in the church to realize their own power and act on it.&#8221;</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://thestarphoenix.com/life/relationships/religion-new-mormon-leader-has-saskatoon-ties/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<postmedia:alexa><![CDATA[Religion: New Mormon leader has Saskatoon ties.

Since then, we have seen a delegation go to Ottawa, saturation on the media and rallies and demonstrations. We have also seen a continuous outpouring of racist comments on social media.</p>\n<p>It has become very apparent that a disgusting degree of racism exists just beneath the surface in this province. Social media and the comments sections of news outlets lit up with racist and negative commentary about the not-guilty verdict in the case.</p>\n<p>This was a serious case that included the loss of life of a young man. The verdict has split the province and race relations have been set back to the 1950s.</p>\n<p>One of the main platforms has become social media. This enables anonymity and false profiles that embolden some individuals to spew vitriol that was previously reserved for coffee row, the door step or the local watering hole.</p>\n<p>Also, I can\u2019t help but think that the highly vocal rhetoric of the white supremacist government south of the border is seeping over the line and emboldens their like-minded brethren in this country.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_374885\" style=\"max-width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2018/02/0210-boushie-ralley-ldr020-jpg.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"374885\" data-permalink=\"http://thestarphoenix.com/opinion/columnists/cuthand-racism-hides-behind-social-media/attachment/0210-boushie-ralley-ldr020-jpg-jpg/#main\" data-orig-file=\"http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2018/02/0210-boushie-ralley-ldr020-jpg.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1000,750\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Saskatoon StarPhoenix&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS-1D X&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;SASKATOON,SK--FEBRUARY 10\\/2018-0212 News Boushie Ralley- Supporters during a rally for the Bouchie family at the Court of Queen&#039;s Bench in Saskatoon, SK on Saturday, February 10, 2018.(Saskatoon StarPhoenix\\/Liam Richards)&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Saskatoon StarPhoenix&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;27&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.002&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;0210 Boushie Ralley LDR020.JPG&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"021018-0210_Boushie_Ralley_LDR020.JPG\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;SASKATOON,SK&#8211;FEBRUARY 10/2018-0212 News Boushie Ralley- Supporters during a rally for the Bouchie family at the Court of Queen&#8217;s Bench in Saskatoon, SK on Saturday, February 10, 2018.(Saskatoon StarPhoenix/Liam Richards)&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2018/02/0210-boushie-ralley-ldr020-jpg.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2018/02/0210-boushie-ralley-ldr020-jpg.jpg?w=640\" class=\"size-full wp-image-374885\" src=\"http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2018/02/0210-boushie-ralley-ldr020-jpg.jpg?w=640\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2018/02/0210-boushie-ralley-ldr020-jpg.jpg?w=640 640w, http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2018/02/0210-boushie-ralley-ldr020-jpg.jpg?w=150 150w, http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2018/02/0210-boushie-ralley-ldr020-jpg.jpg?w=300 300w, http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2018/02/0210-boushie-ralley-ldr020-jpg.jpg?w=768 768w, http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2018/02/0210-boushie-ralley-ldr020-jpg.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"  ></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Supporters during a rally for the Boushie family at the Court of Queen&#8217;s Bench in Saskatoon, SK on Saturday, February 10, 2018.</p></div>\n<p>My inbox began to fill up with ignorant and uninformed comments. Some were trying to goad me into an argument, but there is a rule in newspapers that you don\u2019t accept unsigned correspondence.

Somehow in his bent reality, it was my fault.</p>\n<p>I figured boo hoo, he can dish it out but can\u2019t take it.</p>\n<p>While the trolls, assorted low lives and bottom feeders came out and had a field day, there were many more good people who rose to the occasion and came out in support of the cause and the sense that something very wrong had occurred.

This generated some $355 million in wages and over $1.5 billion in economic activity.\u201d</p>\n<p>Participation and attendance at this year\u2019s Bridges Awards broke recent records, said Chris Gu\u00e9rette, CEO of the SRHBA.

It\u2019s easy to feel a little unsure about growth and the housing market in Saskatoon given some of the articles and news stories that tend to come out, but the incredible number of submissions that came in, and the quality of them all, is proof that the industry is as engaged, productive and innovative as ever,\u201d said Gu\u00e9rette.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_375747\" style=\"max-width: 210px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2018/02/bridgesawardnorthridge-jpg.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"375747\" data-permalink=\"http://thestarphoenix.com/life/homes/building-on-excellence-bridges-awards/attachment/bridgesawardnorthridge-jpg-jpg/#main\" data-orig-file=\"http://wpmedia.thestarphoenix.com/2018/02/bridgesawardnorthridge-jpg.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"700,1050\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D800&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;North Ridge Development Corporation was named Builder of the Year for an unprecedented third year in a row at the Bridges Awards, held Feb. 10 by the Saskatoon &amp; Region Home Builders&#039; Association.

First, we are always looking to make improvements to the Bridges Awards and often use the CHBA National Awards for Housing Excellence as a benchmark. Recruiting judges this way aligns us more closely with the process for the National Awards and the other top housing awards across the country. It also allowed us to recruit the top experts in the field people who have been in the building industry for decades, and people who previously judged some of the other top housing awards in Canada \u2014 without having to worry about existing relationships in our relatively small community,\u201d said Gu\u00e9rette.</p>\n<p>Presiding over this year\u2019s Bridges Awards was master of ceremonies Collin Pullar, president of the Saskatchewan Construction Safety Association. His entertaining delivery included safety-themed messages.</p>\n<p>North Ridge Development Corporation was the big winner at this year\u2019s Bridges Awards, taking home 11 awards, including the prized Builder of the Year Award for an unprecedented third year in a row. In his acceptance speech, North Ridge vice-president of operations Errol Fisher attributed the company\u2019s success to the exacting standards established and adhered to by co-founder Wally Mah.</p>\n<p>Delonix Homes was named Renovator of the Year, one of four crystal statues a0ccepted by owner Daryl Shannon.

Miller Contracting won for Best Production Home (Over 1,300 Sq. Ft) and On The Mark Homes received the Best Custom Home (1,500 \u2014 2,200 Sq. Ft) Award.</p>\n<p>The 400-plus people in attendance rose to their feet to offer standing ovations for the two individuals receiving this year\u2019s Ambassador Awards. Russell Walsh of Superior Cabinets and Joe Ehr of Ehrenburg Homes, both long-standing members of the SRHBA, were recognized for their decades of service to the community and the residential construction industry in Saskatoon.</p>\n<p>Gu\u00e9rette praised all the Bridges Awards finalists and winners for their outstanding professionalism and commitment to excellence, describing them as the \u201cbest of the best.\u201d</p>\n<p>By joining the SRHBA, companies hold themselves to the highest levels of quality. \u201cThey\u2019re required to adhere to a code of ethics, and to conduct business with the utmost professionalism, go through all the proper channels, have the proper safety training and insurance,\u201d said Gu\u00e9rette.</p>\n<p>\u201cWith the Bridges Awards winners, you\u2019re seeing the companies who managed to stand out in that pool of already impressive applicants. Seeing that Bridges Award winner badge on a company\u2019s billboard or website tells you that not only has that company chosen to demonstrate their professionalism by belonging to the association, they\u2019ve also done such incredible work in the past year that they rose to the top even when being compared to the best builders and renovators in Saskatoon. That\u2019s something that should give people a lot of confidence.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a complete list of Bridges Awards winners, go to <em>saskatoonhomebuilders.com.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>26th Annual Bridges Awards Winners </strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table width=\"470\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\" width=\"470\"><strong>Industry Award Category </strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"228\">Community Service Award</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\" width=\"242\"><strong>North Ridge Development Corporation</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"228\">Customer Service Award</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\" width=\"242\"><strong>Linda Buekert Ehrenburg Homes</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"228\">Environmental Stewardship Award</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\" width=\"242\"><strong>Delonix Homes</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"228\">Environmental Leadership in Housing</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\" width=\"242\"><strong>North Ridge Development Corporation</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"228\">Innovation of the Year</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\" width=\"242\"><strong>North Ridge Development Corporation</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"228\">New Home Sales Person of the Year</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\" width=\"242\"><strong>Lynn Robison Daytona Homes</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"228\">Professional Service Award</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\" width=\"242\"><strong>Delonix Homes</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"228\">Safety Stewardship Award</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\" width=\"242\"><strong>North Ridge Renovations </strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"228\">Safety Leadership in Housing</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\" width=\"242\"><strong>North Ridge Development Corporation</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\" width=\"470\"><strong>Marketing Award Category </strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"198\">Best Brochure/Kit</td>\n<td colspan=\"5\" width=\"272\"><strong>North Ridge Development Corporation</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"198\">Best Digital Media Campaign</td>\n<td colspan=\"5\" width=\"272\"><strong>Daytona Homes</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"198\">Best Print Ad</td>\n<td colspan=\"5\" width=\"272\"><strong>North Ridge Development Corporation</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\" width=\"470\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>New Home &amp;
