Heckler. The report detailed differences in health between white people, black people, and other minorities, and led to all sorts of changes in policies, programs, research, etc. on the national and state level.</p>\n\n<p>There are many different factors that contribute to the health disparities affecting black people in the US, including poverty, education, housing, access to healthy foods, and violence and crime. Conscious and unconscious biases also <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/davidrwilliams/files/jvp150125.pdf\">manifest</a> as discrimination in doctor&#39;s offices, affecting people&#39;s health in various ways, and sometimes even discouraging people from seeking care or adhering to treatment. While there&rsquo;s been some progress in combating these issues and closing the disparity gap &mdash; the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/aahealth/index.html\">death rate</a> (the ratio of people who die in a given population during a certain time period) among black people in the US has dropped 25% in the last two decades &mdash; the truth is there&rsquo;s still a lot of work to do. </p>\n\n<p>Here are some health disparities you may or may not have heard of.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Peopleimages / Getty Images</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>Young black Americans are more likely to develop and die from chronic diseases that don't show up in white Americans until older age.</h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-02/16/10/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-11159-1518795114-3.jpg?resize=625:417\" width=\"625\" height=\"417\" alt=\"Young black Americans are more likely to develop and die from chronic diseases that don't show up in white Americans until older age.\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>Black people in the US may be living longer these days, but that applies mostly to people who are already 65 years old or older, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/aahealth/infographic.html#graphic\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. That said, there&rsquo;s still a gap in life expectancy between black people and white people &mdash; about 3.4 years, according to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6617e1.htm\">CDC data</a> from 2014 &mdash; and it has a lot to do with younger black people developing chronic health conditions earlier in life, which then lead to an early death.

Specifically, suicide rates among black children went from 1.36 per million between 1993 and 1997 to 2.54 per million between 2008 and 2012. (During that same time the rates declined for white children.) And according to the most recent study, 36.8% of elementary-aged kids who committed suicide between 2003 and 2012 were black. These children were more likely to be male and less likely to exhibit depression, and the most common precipitating circumstance seemed to be relationship problems with family and friends. However, suicide rates between racial groups flip over as kids get older, and black teens and adults are less likely to kill themselves than whites.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Digitalskillet / Getty Images</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>Finally, black people are victims of violence at farrrr higher rates than the general population.</h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-02/16/10/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/sub-buzz-12727-1518795952-2.jpg?resize=625:416\" width=\"625\" height=\"416\" alt=\"Finally, black people are victims of violence at farrrr higher rates than the general population.\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>Black people have a rate of death due to homicide that is <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6631a9.htm\">eight times</a> that for white people, according to the CDC, and gun violence is the <a href=\"https://robinkelly.house.gov/sites/robinkelly.house.gov/files/2015%20Kelly%20Report.pdf\">leading cause</a> of death for black men between 10 and 24 years old.

According to the essay, Dunham chose to have the procedure as a last-ditch-effort to ease pain that continued, unabated, through many different treatment regimens.</p>\n\n<p>\"I go to pelvic-floor therapy, massage therapy, pain therapy, color therapy, acupuncture, yoga, and a brief yet horrifying foray into vaginal massage from a stranger. I am determined to outmaneuver whatever is eating me from the inside. But I can only run so well with cement blocks strapped to my feet. Finally I ask my doctor if my uterus needs to come out. She says, &#39;let&#39;s wait and see&#39;,\" Dunham wrote. Two days after this conversation, Dunham wrote that she checked herself into the hospital, determined to leave without a uterus.</p>\n\n<p>Hysterectomies are not a common treatment for endometriosis. Dunham wrote that it took six days in the hospital, a 1,000-word letter as proof of consent, three therapy sessions, and an unsuccessful dilation and curettage procedure until she finally convinced her doctors to perform a hysterectomy. So what exactly is the standard of care for this painful condition?

The tissue typically grows on pelvic organs such as the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bladder, and bowel, Huang says. In rare cases, it can grow on organs elsewhere in the body, such as the lungs or even the brain. The exact cause of endometriosis is unknown.</p>\n\n<p>\"Because the blood has nowhere to go and it gets trapped in the body, this can cause inflammation... so wherever the lesions or endometrial tissue is, there&#39;s a lot of scarring and pain, usually during the period,\" Huang says. So the most common symptoms are pelvic pain, painful periods, pain during intercourse, bowel issues, and excessive bleeding.</p>\n\n<p>The pain associated with endometriosis is not something that goes away after popping some ibuprofen and using a hot water bottle. It&#39;s often described as excruciating, persistent, and even debilitating. When endometriosis goes undiagnosed and/or untreated, Huang says, the scarring can become so severe that the areas with lesions hurt all the time, not just during a period. Long-term complications can include infertility, pelvic cysts, \"chocolate\" cysts on the ovaries, and even bowel obstructions.</p>\n\n\n <p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://instagram.com/p/z5tzoMgZww/\">instagram.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>There is no cure for endometriosis, but you can treat symptoms with hormonal birth control pills, pain medication, and pelvic floor therapy.</h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-02/16/19/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-6427-1518826441-1.jpg\" width=\"459\" height=\"373\" alt=\"There is no cure for endometriosis, but you can treat symptoms with hormonal birth control pills, pain medication, and pelvic floor therapy.\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>Typically, doctors diagnose <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/laraparker/things-women-with-endometriosis-want-you-to-know?utm_term=.fwmy4Y457#.cgVqQMQPE\">endometriosis</a> by doing a detailed history, a pelvic exam, and in some cases, surgery to identify the lesions. \"Performing surgery to make a diagnosis is very invasive, so I work very closely with a radiologist and we use a MRI protocol to make the diagnosis instead, and it&#39;s over 80% accurate,\" Huang says.</p>\n\n<p>Once you are diagnosed, the treatment really varies depending on your goals and the type of pain. \"If the woman is not trying to get pregnant, we will try hormonal birth control to regulate the hormones and period but this only minimizes symptoms and it doesn&#39;t treat the actual problem,\" Huang says. Doctors may prescribe birth control pills or a progestin-only contraceptives, such as the hormonal IUD (Mirena) or the Depo-Provera injection. There are a few other medications that induce an artificial menopause or prevent the growth of the endometrium, but these are older and less popular due to the severe side effects.</p>\n\n<p>Pelvic floor therapy can be helpful because endometriosis can cause the pelvic floor muscles to tense up, Huang says, so you need help to relax them again. Patients may also see a sex therapist to learn techniques that can make sex less painful and in some cases, possible.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Peter Ardito / Getty Images / Via <a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/license/128219825\">gettyimages.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>There are surgeries to treat endometriosis, such as laparoscopic excision or ablation, but these are often done to remove abnormal tissue while conserving the reproductive organs.</h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-02/16/19/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/sub-buzz-29592-1518826555-7.jpg?resize=625:437\" width=\"625\" height=\"437\" alt=\"There are surgeries to treat endometriosis, such as laparoscopic excision or ablation, but these are often done to remove abnormal tissue while conserving the reproductive organs.\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>\"If the patient does want to get pregnant then birth control pills aren&#39;t an option, or if they are still in a lot of pain and they&#39;ve tried other treatments, then we offer surgical intervention,\" Huang says. When doctors do surgically remove the endometrial tissue, they try to do so without removing any organs, called \"conservative therapy,\" and this is done laparoscopically.</p>\n\n<p>There are generally two types of laparoscopic surgery: resection (or excision) or ablation. \"An endometriosis resection means we remove the entire lesion but conserve the uterus and ovaries and other organs and in this case, the recurrence is very low; but an ablation only burns off the superficial layer of the lesion so historically, the recurrence rate is much higher,\" Huang says. Although conservative therapy surgeries can successfully treat endometriosis, they are still invasive and costly procedures. So for many women, they simply aren&#39;t an option.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Sognolucido / Getty Images / Via <a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/license/484227855\">gettyimages.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>Hysterectomies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which remove the entire uterus \u00e2\u0080\u0094 do not cure endometriosis and the pain can still come back.</h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-02/16/19/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-6427-1518826736-3.jpg?resize=625:417\" width=\"625\" height=\"417\" alt=\"Hysterectomies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which remove the entire uterus \u00e2\u0080\u0094 do not cure endometriosis and the pain can still come back.\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>\"If you only have endometriosis, I won&#39;t recommend a hysterectomy,\" Huang says. Another problem with hysterectomies is that the pain can still come back. \"A hysterectomy doesn&#39;t always help because endometriosis is by definition an extrauterine disease, which means it exists outside the uterus &mdash; so as long as you still have your ovaries and your hormones, then any endometrial tissue can bleed again and cause pain,\" Huang says. A hysterectomy only removes the uterus (and the cervix, if it&#39;s a total hysterectomy), but not the ovaries.</p>\n\n<p>\"I don&#39;t suggest it as a treatment for endometriosis, but if the woman brings it up or demands that she wants her uterus removed and doesn&#39;t want children, then we&#39;ll discuss it,\" Huang says. However, a hysterectomy can help if you have a condition called adenomyosis, Huang says, which means the endometrial tissue has invaded the muscle tissue of the uterus. Sometimes people have both endometriosis and adenomyosis, but the hysterectomy can really only \"cure\" the latter. Dunham did not confirm whether she had adenomyosis.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Prasit Photo / Getty Images / Via <a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/license/694460708\">gettyimages.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>And because a hysterectomy makes it impossible to conceive without a surrogate, it isn't an option for many women who want to have children.</h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-02/16/19/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/sub-buzz-8151-1518826837-4.jpg?resize=625:417\" width=\"625\" height=\"417\" alt=\"And because a hysterectomy makes it impossible to conceive without a surrogate, it isn't an option for many women who want to have children.\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>When a patient wants a hysterectomy, there are a few important factors to consider, such as age, fertility concerns, pain level, and the risks and benefits of the procedure. \"We really need to understand the patient&#39;s goals and what they are trying to achieve... usually, the patient has tried multiple therapies and it&#39;s a last resort,\" Huang says. For women who want a hysterectomy but still want children, they will have to take the long and costly road of IVF and surrogacy to get there. So it&#39;s not an easy decision by any means.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Carlos G.

However, the range in treatment options for endometriosis means you may get very different recommendations depending on the doctor, and not all of them are experienced with treating endometriosis.</p>\n\n<p>So if you have endometriosis or you think you have it, you should do your own research beforehand and go to your OBGYN ready to ask all your questions. \"Then, go see someone else and ask the same questions, because it&#39;s always good to get a second opinion... there&#39;s really nothing preventing you from seeing another doctor,\" Huang says.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Voisin / Getty Images / Via <a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/license/530692158\">gettyimages.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\t<h1>While Dunham's decision to get a hysterectomy might've been an unusual one, it did highlight an important point: endometriosis can be incredibly painful and frustrating.</h1>\n\n\t \n\t\t  <iframe src=\"https://instagram.com/p/BfQ2Yu3F451/embed/\" height=\"710\" width=\"612\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>\n\t  \n\t<p>Dunham explains that the decision to remove her uterus was not easy, and there were a lot of emotions involved. \"Because I had to work so hard to have my pain acknowledged, there was no time to feel fear or grief. To say goodbye.

Unfortunately, many women also go undiagnosed, so it&#39;s important to see an OBGYN if you think you have symptoms. \"If you&#39;re having a lot of pain during your period, that isn&#39;t normal &mdash; it doesn&#39;t always mean you have endometriosis &mdash; but it isn&#39;t normal, so you should go see a doctor to find out why you&#39;re having the pain,\" Huang says.</p>\n\n\n <p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://instagram.com/p/BfQ2Yu3F451/\">instagram.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\t<h1>Endometriosis affects <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/about_acog/news_room/~/media/newsroom/millionwomanmarchendometriosisfactsheet.pdf\">one in ten women</a> of reproductive age \u00e2\u0080\u0094 so if you have it, know that you aren't alone.</h1>\n\n\t \n\t\t  <iframe src=\"https://instagram.com/p/Bce0EwLFASy/embed/\" height=\"710\" width=\"612\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>\n\t  \n\t\n\n\n <p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://instagram.com/p/Bce0EwLFASy/\">instagram.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]]></description>\n<author>Caroline Kee</author>\n<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/carolinekee/lena-dunham-hysterectomy-endometriosis</guid>\n<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 23:06:02 -0500</pubDate>\n<media:group>\n  <media:description type=\"html\">There are many different therapies for endometriosis, a condition that causes severe pelvic pain and bleeding, but hysterectomies typically aren&#x27;t one of them.</media:description>\n  <media:credit role=\"user\" scheme=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com\">carolinekee</media:credit>\n  <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  <media:content height=\"236\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/16/19/tmp/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/tmp-name-2-6691-1518827445-5.jpg\" width=\"355\" />\n  <media:content isDefault=\"true\" medium=\"video\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Dunham, best known for her HBO series &#x22;Girls,&#x22; wrote that she chose to have her uterus removed after a decade-long battle with endometriosis.

Patients may also see a sex therapist to learn techniques that can make sex less painful and in some cases, possible.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"437\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/16/19/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/sub-buzz-29592-1518826555-7.jpg?resize=625:437\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x22;If the patient does want to get pregnant then birth control pills aren&#x27;t an option, or if they are still in a lot of pain and they&#x27;ve tried other treatments, then we offer surgical intervention,&#x22; Huang says. When doctors do surgically remove the endometrial tissue, they try to do so without removing any organs, called &#x22;conservative therapy,&#x22; and this is done laparoscopically.\n\nThere are generally two types of laparoscopic surgery: resection (or excision) or ablation. &#x22;An endometriosis resection means we remove the entire lesion but conserve the uterus and ovaries and other organs and in this case, the recurrence is very low; but an ablation only burns off the superficial layer of the lesion so historically, the recurrence rate is much higher,&#x22; Huang says. Although conservative therapy surgeries can successfully treat endometriosis, they are still invasive and costly procedures. So for many women, they simply aren&#x27;t an option.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"417\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/16/19/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-6427-1518826736-3.jpg?resize=625:417\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x22;If you only have endometriosis, I won&#x27;t recommend a hysterectomy,&#x22; Huang says. Another problem with hysterectomies is that the pain can still come back. &#x22;A hysterectomy doesn&#x27;t always help because endometriosis is by definition an extrauterine disease, which means it exists outside the uterus &#x2014; so as long as you still have your ovaries and your hormones, then any endometrial tissue can bleed again and cause pain,&#x22; Huang says. A hysterectomy only removes the uterus (and the cervix, if it&#x27;s a total hysterectomy), but not the ovaries.\n\n&#x22;I don&#x27;t suggest it as a treatment for endometriosis, but if the woman brings it up or demands that she wants her uterus removed and doesn&#x27;t want children, then we&#x27;ll discuss it,&#x22; Huang says. However, a hysterectomy can help if you have a condition called adenomyosis, Huang says, which means the endometrial tissue has invaded the muscle tissue of the uterus. Sometimes people have both endometriosis and adenomyosis, but the hysterectomy can really only &#x22;cure&#x22; the latter. Dunham did not confirm whether she had adenomyosis.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"417\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/16/19/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/sub-buzz-8151-1518826837-4.jpg?resize=625:417\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">When a patient wants a hysterectomy, there are a few important factors to consider, such as age, fertility concerns, pain level, and the risks and benefits of the procedure. &#x22;We really need to understand the patient&#x27;s goals and what they are trying to achieve... usually, the patient has tried multiple therapies and it&#x27;s a last resort,&#x22; Huang says. For women who want a hysterectomy but still want children, they will have to take the long and costly road of IVF and surrogacy to get there. So it&#x27;s not an easy decision by any means.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"339\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/16/19/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-6276-1518826711-10.jpg\" width=\"509\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x22;Our primary goal is to understand how endometriosis is affecting the patient&#x27;s life and what we are trying to fix, and to explore all of the treatment options before jumping into surgery,&#x22; Huang says. However, the range in treatment options for endometriosis means you may get very different recommendations depending on the doctor, and not all of them are experienced with treating endometriosis.\n\nSo if you have endometriosis or you think you have it, you should do your own research beforehand and go to your OBGYN ready to ask all your questions. &#x22;Then, go see someone else and ask the same questions, because it&#x27;s always good to get a second opinion... there&#x27;s really nothing preventing you from seeing another doctor,&#x22; Huang says.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"video\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Dunham explains that the decision to remove her uterus was not easy, and there were a lot of emotions involved. &#x22;Because I had to work so hard to have my pain acknowledged, there was no time to feel fear or grief. To say goodbye. I made a choice that never was a choice for me, yet mourning feels like a luxury I don&#x2019;t have,&#x22; she wrote.\n\nEndometriosis can be difficult to diagnose and treat, and people can experience frustration from years of being misdiagnosed or not being given the right care. &#x22;Many women are not properly treated for the disease,&#x22; Huang says. Unfortunately, many women also go undiagnosed, so it&#x27;s important to see an OBGYN if you think you have symptoms. &#x22;If you&#x27;re having a lot of pain during your period, that isn&#x27;t normal &#x2014; it doesn&#x27;t always mean you have endometriosis &#x2014; but it isn&#x27;t normal, so you should go see a doctor to find out why you&#x27;re having the pain,&#x22; Huang says.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n    <media:player url=\"https://instagram.com/p/BfQ2Yu3F451/\" />\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"video\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n    <media:player url=\"https://instagram.com/p/Bce0EwLFASy/\" />\n  </media:content>\n</media:group>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>This Unflattering Introvert Quiz Will Reveal A Secret Truth About You</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/annaborges/which-introvert-stereotype-are-you?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n<p>Brb, canceling all my plans.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]]></description>\n<author>Anna Borges</author>\n<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/annaborges/which-introvert-stereotype-are-you</guid>\n<pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 18:21:03 -0500</pubDate>\n<media:group>\n  <media:description type=\"html\">Brb, canceling all my plans.</media:description>\n  <media:credit role=\"user\" scheme=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com\">annaborges</media:credit>\n  <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  <media:content height=\"236\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/15/18/tmp/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/tmp-name-2-8107-1518736065-16.jpg\" width=\"355\" />\n  <media:content isDefault=\"true\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n</media:group>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>Norovirus Outbreak At The Olympics Is Now Spreading To Athletes</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/carolinekee/norovirus-outbreak-olympics-diarrhea-everywhere?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n<p>About 200 people at the Winter Olympics, including two Swiss skiers, have been infected with the germ that causes vomiting and diarrhea.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>Officials are currently scrambling to contain an outbreak of norovirus among security staff at the Winter Olympics.

It can also spread directly from person to person when you are in close contact.</p>\n\n<p>\"It only takes 10 to 20 virus particles to infect someone, and when you&#39;re contagious you&#39;re shedding millions and billions of disease particles,\" Wormley says.

You should go to the hospital if your symptoms do not go away after three days or they worsen. Severe symptoms include a high and persistent fever and signs of dehydration (dizziness, not being able to urinate, sunken eyes, etc.). You should also seek medical care if you contract norovirus and you&#39;re considered \"high risk,\" which means the very young, the very old, and people who are immunocompromised, Wormley says.</p>\n\n<p>If you go to the hospital or urgent care for norovirus, you&#39;ll probably just get an IV bag to replace your fluids &mdash; and no antibiotics. \"A common misconception with norovirus is that you need to go to your doctor and ask for antibiotics but this is a virus, so antibiotics won&#39;t work,\" Wormley says.

You also want to avoid putting your hands in your mouth or biting your nails at all times, Wormley says, because this can transmit virus particles directly into your body.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re caring for a sick person, you should sanitize everything and wear gloves, Wormley says. You should also limit or avoid contact with said sick person, even if it&#39;s your partner or child. \"When you vomit you can release aerosols and these can infect someone if they are close enough,\" Wormley says.

Wormley Jr.&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the University of Texas at San Antonio, tells BuzzFeed News. This can lead to nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.

There isn&#x27;t any specific treatment for norovirus other than supportive care, aka lots of rest and fluids, since it&#x27;s very dehydrating.\n\nIf the diarrhea is bloody, it&#x27;s probably not norovirus and you should see a doctor. &#x22;This is most likely an infection with bacteria, such as E. coli or shigella,&#x22; Wormley says.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"500\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/14/17/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-17092-1518647283-1.jpg?resize=625:500\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Norovirus typically spreads by the fecal-oral route, Wormley says, which means people contract the virus from consuming food or beverages contaminated with fecal matter, or from touching their hands to their mouth after coming into contact with a contaminated surface (the bathroom sink, counter, doorknobs) or while cleaning up after a sick person. It can also spread directly from person to person when you are in close contact.\n\n&#x22;It only takes 10 to 20 virus particles to infect someone, and when you&#x27;re contagious you&#x27;re shedding millions and billions of disease particles,&#x22; Wormley says. So you are most contagious when you have symptoms, but you can still transmit the virus to others after symptoms go away and you feel fine.&#x22; The virus can be found in your stool for up to two or three weeks after,&#x22; Wormley says.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"417\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/16/11/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-12919-1518798550-14.jpg?resize=625:417\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Norovirus outbreaks have also been linked to schools, public bathrooms, and kitchens where food is prepared for the masses. It doesn&#x27;t take much for norovirus to spread, so one sick person can lead to a massive outbreak.\n\nAs we mentioned, norovirus has been known to spread like wildfire on cruise ships, but also planes and buses. &#x22;When you&#x27;re traveling, you might already be dehydrated and this can exacerbate the norovirus symptoms, so you have to be careful,&#x22; Wormley says. However, norovirus is not the same as traveler&#x27;s diarrhea, which is usually caused by bacteria.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"417\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/14/17/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/sub-buzz-18380-1518647809-5.jpg?resize=625:417\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x22;Most people don&#x2019;t need to be hospitalized, but some people can become severely dehydrated and others are at risk for more complications,&#x22; Wormley says. You should go to the hospital if your symptoms do not go away after three days or they worsen. Severe symptoms include a high and persistent fever and signs of dehydration (dizziness, not being able to urinate, sunken eyes, etc.). You should also seek medical care if you contract norovirus and you&#x27;re considered &#x22;high risk,&#x22; which means the very young, the very old, and people who are immunocompromised, Wormley says.\n\nIf you go to the hospital or urgent care for norovirus, you&#x27;ll probably just get an IV bag to replace your fluids &#x2014; and no antibiotics. &#x22;A common misconception with norovirus is that you need to go to your doctor and ask for antibiotics but this is a virus, so antibiotics won&#x27;t work,&#x22; Wormley says. So just remember to stay hydrated and ride it out. &#x22;You might feel like you&#x27;re going to die but you probably aren&#x27;t,&#x22; Wormley says.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"460\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/14/17/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/sub-buzz-18519-1518647863-1.jpg?resize=625:460\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x22;Handwashing and sanitizing should be your best friend,&#x22; Wormley says. So make sure to wash your hands properly (with soap and water for at least 30 seconds) after you use the bathroom or public transport, before you eat or prepare food, and before you touch your face. You also want to avoid putting your hands in your mouth or biting your nails at all times, Wormley says, because this can transmit virus particles directly into your body.\n\nIf you&#x27;re caring for a sick person, you should sanitize everything and wear gloves, Wormley says. You should also limit or avoid contact with said sick person, even if it&#x27;s your partner or child. &#x22;When you vomit you can release aerosols and these can infect someone if they are close enough,&#x22; Wormley says. Oh, and no kissing your sick partner for a while, especially if they were vomiting. And if you&#x27;re sick, try to stay home and do not prepare food for other people.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"417\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/14/17/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-17210-1518647895-7.jpg?resize=625:417\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">As we mentioned, norovirus is a highly contagious bug and you can still be contagious after your symptoms go away.

Teenage years are a critical period for growth, and serious weight loss could affect important things like bone development and hormone levels, which will impact overall maturation, she adds.\n\n&#x22;Teenagers are supposed to be growing and getting bigger, and their brains just aren&#x27;t fully developed yet &#x2014; the part of the brain that is more involved in the emotional world is developing faster than the part of the brain that is really good at long-term planning and decision making,&#x22; she says. &#x22;So while Weight Watchers is suggesting that this might be a good time to implement healthy behavioral strategies, I think saying that without data and research, as to the most responsible way to do it, can be dangerous.&#x22;</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">In the response, Weight Watchers basically says, after hearing the criticism against its new initiatives, it understands how vulnerable people are during their teenage years and that their messaging toward teens needs to be handled responsibly. \n\nThe company then said its main focus is giving teens the tools to live healthier lives and that the program being provided will not be a &#x22;diet,&#x22; but instead a curriculum that guides healthy habits for life. What that actually means for the company&#x27;s new initiatives and teen-focused programs is still TBD.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x3C;i&#x3E;BuzzFeed News has reached out to Weight Watchers for comment.&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x3C;i&#x3E;If you struggle with an eating disorder or just need to talk to someone, you can call NEDA, the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/help-support/contact-helpline&#x22;&#x3E;National Eating Disorders Association&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, at 1-800-931-2237 and or texting NEDA to 74174, the Crisis Text Line.

The uterus makes something called prostaglandins during the period. They are chemicals that are responsible for our menstrual cramps. They squeeze smooth muscles of uterus and intestines, which contracts muscles and changes your bowel habits. Some women are more sensitive to the prostaglandins they make. It also can cause nausea. Some people have sort of a trifecta: diarrhea, nausea, and cramps. The things that can help with prostaglandins are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Motrin, Aleve, etc.) are NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs) &mdash; which block the making of more prostaglandins. If you&#39;re getting a lot of cramps, use NSAIDs. The key thing about managing cramps is taking it early. Also, women who take birth control pills make less prostaglandins. When you ovulate, you make more prostaglandins.\"</p>\n\n\n <p><small>MTV</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>Why do I get so emotional when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m on my period?\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/karlijns2\">karlijns2</a></h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-02/5/14/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/sub-buzz-31175-1517858017-10.png?resize=625:349\" width=\"625\" height=\"349\" alt=\"Why do I get so emotional when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m on my period?\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094karlijns2\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>\"There&#39;s not a scientific answer for that, but there is something called PMDD (<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/laraparker/real-stories-of-what-its-like-to-live-with-pmdd?utm_term=.hn1DOYDKL#.ellx76xgL\">Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder</a>) which is &#39;bad&#39; PMS.

Some of the darker blood that comes out has been hanging around the uterus for a while, so it&#x27;s older blood. But not to worry, because it&#x27;s perfectly common and healthy.&#x22;</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"322\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/5/14/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/sub-buzz-31073-1517857896-9.png?resize=625:322\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x22;I have a scientific answer for that. The uterus makes something called prostaglandins during the period. They are chemicals that are responsible for our menstrual cramps. They squeeze smooth muscles of uterus and intestines, which contracts muscles and changes your bowel habits. Some women are more sensitive to the prostaglandins they make. It also can cause nausea. Some people have sort of a trifecta: diarrhea, nausea, and cramps. The things that can help with prostaglandins are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Motrin, Aleve, etc.) are NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs) &#x2014; which block the making of more prostaglandins. If you&#x27;re getting a lot of cramps, use NSAIDs. The key thing about managing cramps is taking it early. Also, women who take birth control pills make less prostaglandins. When you ovulate, you make more prostaglandins.&#x22;</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"349\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/5/14/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/sub-buzz-31175-1517858017-10.png?resize=625:349\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x22;There&#x27;s not a scientific answer for that, but there is something called PMDD (&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/laraparker/real-stories-of-what-its-like-to-live-with-pmdd?utm_term=.hn1DOYDKL#.ellx76xgL&#x22;&#x3E;Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder&#x3C;/a&#x3E;) which is &#x27;bad&#x27; PMS. There is strict medical criteria for this. Basically, these are really bad symptoms of anxiety, food cravings, irritability, bloating, full breasts discomfort. These symptoms get worse right before the period. We do know the same things we use to treat depression work pretty well for PMDD; SSRI anti-depressants work well for it.&#x22;</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"649\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/5/15/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/sub-buzz-13967-1517862579-1.jpg\" width=\"538\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x22;The answer is no, it will not go back up into the uterus.

It&#x27;s hard to imagine someone who has a uterus not getting a period ever. For example, if I have someone who reached the age of seventeen and doesn&#x27;t have a period, we usually evaluate the period medically. There are people who have certain genetic abnormalities which lead them to never get a period. Those women would not get pregnant.&#x22;</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"349\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/5/14/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-10689-1517858963-2.png?resize=625:349\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x22;I would say four hours is overcautious.

But don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t count on it.\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>Science is pretty f*ing amazing. The fact that egg freezing exists &mdash; that there is even the slightest chance that a tiny frozen oocyte floating around in a freezer somewhere in Midtown Manhattan might result in a healthy, human being 10 years down the line &mdash; is astounding. </p>\n\n<p>That being said: the science behind all of it is still relatively new. The first reported pregnancy resulting from <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/24/9/2158/598911\">frozen oocytes was in 1986</a> &mdash; and only about 5,000 <a href=\"http://uscfertility.org/egg-freezing-faqs/\">births from frozen eggs</a> have been reported since. As such, reliable data around success rates is largely limited, confusing, and inconclusive at best. </p>\n\n<p>According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), the chance that any given frozen egg will result in a baby (even when the mother is younger than 38) ranges from 2-12%. During the egg-collection process, hormone stimulation treatment is used to help patients produce more eggs than they would during a normal cycle, so that multiple eggs can be collected and frozen.</p>\n\n<p> But even with a bounty of a baker&rsquo;s dozen eggs or more (which would be considered a very successful round of egg collection and freezing) &mdash; the chances that the eggs will survive freezing, thawing, fertilization, and then result in a successful implantation and pregnancy are often very low. This is especially true for women who freeze their eggs after age 35; who are trying to get pregnant in their 40s; and who underwent treatment using an older, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2729856/\">slow-freezing technique</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While fertility clinics note that recent studies show a 90+% survival rate of frozen eggs using a <a href=\"https://extendfertility.com/blog/egg-freezing-success-rates\">newer vitrification technique</a> &mdash; that figure only accounts for the freezing and thawing part of the process. It says nothing about the likelihood of fertilization and a successful to-term pregnancy. (And as this <a href=\"http://eggsurance.com/egg-freezing-risks/\">heartbreaking story</a> demonstrates &mdash; it is disappointment in those final stages that can be the most traumatic and agonizing.) </p>\n\n<p><b>So &mdash; long story short: freezing your eggs is faaaaar from an insurance policy.</b> The reality is, while you are giving yourself another (small) chance at having a child later in life &mdash; you shouldn&rsquo;t count on it as a solid Plan B. It&rsquo;s a Plan C at best &mdash; and a pretty stressful one at that.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Christine Huang</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>There will be blood.

And needles. And DIY home chemistry involving strange solvents and powders and stuff that can all be very frightening. Prepare yourself.\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>If you&rsquo;ve done any preliminary research, you know that the scariest part of this whole thing won&rsquo;t be the <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/in-vitro-fertilization/about/pac-20384716\">egg retrieval procedure</a> itself (though, to be fair, the idea of a needle traversing through your vagina and into your ovaries to slurp out a bunch of hormonally induced eggs will take a minute to get comfortable with.) </p>\n\n<p>No &mdash; it&rsquo;s the two weeks leading up to the procedure that the real fun happens. And by &ldquo;fun&rdquo; I mean a rigorous schedule of twice-daily, self-administered hormone injections that would make even the most practiced factory chicken tremble.</p>\n\n<p>So I&rsquo;m not going to sugarcoat this. </p>\n\n<p>Waking up at the buttcrack of dawn every other day to get your blood drawn at a cold, depressing fertility clinic; shooting yourself with a syringe full of hormones twice every day (the moment you wake up and every night before you go to bed); feeling &mdash; and watching &mdash; as your ovaries swell to several times their normal size within the course of days &mdash; none of it is easy. It gets better after a couple of times, but those first few days will be scary (and for those with any discomfort around needles &mdash; straight up harrowing). And on top of all that &mdash; some of the medicine requires precise mixing of powders and solvents, temperature control, and timing. And if you mess up any one of those variables, it can be a big deal and ruin your whole retrieval cycle.</p>\n\n<p><b>That being said: while by no means a piece of cake &mdash; it&rsquo;s all doable.</b> After the first couple of days, the shots become routine and the mixing and timing almost second-nature. You learn what tips and tricks work for you. For me, it was icing the area for your shots 10-15 minutes before each one, injecting the solution very slowly so as to make its entry into your system less shocking (and therefore less painful), and recording each shot location and timestamp in my notepad app to ensure I wasn&rsquo;t missing doses and wasn&rsquo;t shooting myself repeatedly in the same place. Truth be told: the shots themselves don&rsquo;t really hurt that much. The needles are so thin and small they&rsquo;re hardly painful. But wrapping your mind around all of it, and convincing yourself this is worth doing for 14 or so days, can be tough. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to remind yourself that yes, this will suck &mdash;but it&rsquo;s all tolerable with the right attitude, organization and discipline. I&rsquo;m a total disorganized wimp, and I survived. So let that be an inspiration to you all&#33;</p>\n\n\n <p><small>South Park / Via <a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/southparkgifs-d31vEN2v9DzBqEx2/download\">giphy.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>Health risks and complications are uncommon \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but they do happen.

(It&rsquo;s super rare and probably won&rsquo;t happen to you &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4467930/\">but it can happen</a>.) I also didn&rsquo;t know that the long-term effects of extended and recurring hormone stimulation are still unclear. So before you decide to go through with the process, read up as much as you can about all the risk factors involved (ovarian torsions, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, hormonal side effects and retrieval complications, and the emotional risks of this procedure...to name a few.) Here&rsquo;s a good place to start reading about the <a href=\"https://blog.scrcivf.com/egg-freezing-risks-side-effects\">side effects of freezing your eggs</a>. While the worst case scenarios are definitely in the minority &mdash; I would still advise being as informed as possible about any possible risks before committing yourself to this elective procedure.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Diego_cervo / Getty Images</small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>Egg freezing is a lonely, emotionally taxing process.

The next, I was staring out the window onto a big parking lot, unsure of where I was or what had just happened. My friend/ersatz partner Brent appeared by my bedside, and I started putting together the pieces of where I was (the hospital) and what I had just done (scooped out my 20 factory-farmed eggs). The anesthesia had rendered me pretty useless, so Brent escorted me home in a taxi while I slowly regained mobility and full consciousness. We ordered food and he hung out with me until I fell asleep. Without him, I don&rsquo;t know how I would have managed to get through that day.</p>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;re freezing your eggs because for whatever reason, you are not in a place in your life to start a family, yet there is a piece of you that knows you still want the chance one day. That can be a lonely reality to come to terms with. </p>\n\n<p>But don&rsquo;t let that make you turn inward or alienate yourself from people who want to support you through what will be an emotionally stressful process. I was lucky to have great friends and family with whom I was very open about my fears and experience. I also had two friends who had gone through multiple egg retrieval cycles before and who offered their help or guidance any time of day, with any issue. My on-again, off-again boyfriend in California at the time was also a rock during the process &mdash; even FaceTiming with me the first couple of times I took my shots. I knew they were in my corner &mdash; even if only virtually &mdash; which helped me face each day without breaking down.</p>\n\n<p>And you&rsquo;ll also be pleasantly surprised by the number of welcoming, helpful communities there are online to support you &mdash; and even make you laugh. BuzzFeed&rsquo;s own Doree Shafrir has built a thriving community around her fantastic podcast <a href=\"https://eggcellentadventure.com/\">Matt and Doree&rsquo;s Eggcelent Adventure</a>, which chronicles (with refreshing candidness and levity) her experiences in IVF with her partner, Matt. Though focused primarily on people undergoing IVF rather than egg freezing, Matt and Doree&rsquo;s podcast and facebook group helped me feel like I wasn&rsquo;t alone, and that there was a lot I could learn about myself and even laugh about through this process. I highly recommend you find and join support groups like these to learn more and prepare for your procedure.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>NBC / Via <a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/friends-hug-thanks-4Gf2txOa5EGY0\">giphy.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be pregnant now, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sperm you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not mad at \u00e2\u0080\u0094 consider freezing embryos (fertilized eggs) instead of eggs.</h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-02/9/10/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/anigif_sub-buzz-22743-1518189961-16.gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" alt=\"If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be pregnant now, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sperm you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not mad at \u00e2\u0080\u0094 consider freezing embryos (fertilized eggs) instead of eggs.\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>If you&rsquo;re with a partner with whom having a family with is not completely out of the question &mdash; or if you&rsquo;re considering a sperm donor for future baby potential, freezing an embryo might be something worth considering. After reading through many forums and blogs on the matter, I found that one of the biggest regrets among women struggling through unsuccessful IVF rounds (using both fresh and frozen eggs/embryos) is that they didn&rsquo;t freeze embryos at an earlier age. Eggs are more fragile than embryos, meaning there is a higher chance that some can be lost in the freezing, thawing, and fertilization process. So if a decent sperm donor is in the picture now &mdash; it won&rsquo;t hurt to look into options beyond egg preservation.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Giphy / Via <a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/artists-on-tumblr-featured-10PALGh4RJcEta\">giphy.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>During the hormone treatment, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s normal for your emotions to be all over the place.

Your brain isn&rsquo;t your brain for those weeks. Don&rsquo;t trust it.&rdquo; I tried to heed her advice. But when hormone injections push your estrogen to 10x times their baseline level, and your stomach has bloated to the size of a small watermelon, and you&rsquo;re alone, staring at yourself in the mirror for the 13th day in the row jabbing a needle into your thigh &mdash; feelings get stirred. It&rsquo;s okay to feel not okay. It&rsquo;s important to step back and remind yourself that what you&rsquo;re doing is a big deal on a cosmic level: you&rsquo;re using science to control your future reproduction. It&rsquo;s terrifying, miraculous, empowering, and traumatizing at the same time. You&rsquo;re going to have mood swings at times. The key is to be ready for them, and to set up preventative measures to keep yourself from spiraling into a hormonally-charged tailspin. Have a sponsor to text whenever you&rsquo;re feeling especially emotional. Delete your ex-partners&rsquo; phone numbers. Give your social media passwords to a good friend for the month. Do all that you can to protect yourself from letting the hormones get the best of you.</p>\n\n\n <p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"http://Ramzpaul.com\">Ramzpaul.com</a> / Via <a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/emotional-Ti2w2LOcNlurm/download\">giphy.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>Finally: this sh*t is EXPENSIVE!</h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-02/9/10/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/anigif_sub-buzz-12356-1518190496-9.gif\" width=\"220\" height=\"250\" alt=\"Finally: this sh*t is EXPENSIVE!\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>Even if elective oocyte cryopreservation is technically covered by your employer &mdash; prepare to shell out at least $1000 for this whole thing &mdash; and without coverage, in the ballpark of $10k.

The first reported pregnancy resulting from &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/24/9/2158/598911&#x22;&#x3E;frozen oocytes was in 1986&#x3C;/a&#x3E; &#x2014; and only about 5,000 &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://uscfertility.org/egg-freezing-faqs/&#x22;&#x3E;births from frozen eggs&#x3C;/a&#x3E; have been reported since. As such, reliable data around success rates is largely limited, confusing, and inconclusive at best. \n\nAccording to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), the chance that any given frozen egg will result in a baby (even when the mother is younger than 38) ranges from 2-12%. During the egg-collection process, hormone stimulation treatment is used to help patients produce more eggs than they would during a normal cycle, so that multiple eggs can be collected and frozen.\n\n But even with a bounty of a baker&#x2019;s dozen eggs or more (which would be considered a very successful round of egg collection and freezing) &#x2014; the chances that the eggs will survive freezing, thawing, fertilization, and then result in a successful implantation and pregnancy are often very low. This is especially true for women who freeze their eggs after age 35; who are trying to get pregnant in their 40s; and who underwent treatment using an older, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2729856/&#x22;&#x3E;slow-freezing technique&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.\n\nWhile fertility clinics note that recent studies show a 90+% survival rate of frozen eggs using a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://extendfertility.com/blog/egg-freezing-success-rates&#x22;&#x3E;newer vitrification technique&#x3C;/a&#x3E; &#x2014; that figure only accounts for the freezing and thawing part of the process. It says nothing about the likelihood of fertilization and a successful to-term pregnancy. (And as this &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://eggsurance.com/egg-freezing-risks/&#x22;&#x3E;heartbreaking story&#x3C;/a&#x3E; demonstrates &#x2014; it is disappointment in those final stages that can be the most traumatic and agonizing.) \n\n&#x3C;b&#x3E;So &#x2014; long story short: freezing your eggs is faaaaar from an insurance policy.&#x3C;/b&#x3E; The reality is, while you are giving yourself another (small) chance at having a child later in life &#x2014; you shouldn&#x2019;t count on it as a solid Plan B. It&#x2019;s a Plan C at best &#x2014; and a pretty stressful one at that.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"113\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/9/10/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/anigif_sub-buzz-22743-1518189541-14.gif\" width=\"200\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">If you&#x2019;ve done any preliminary research, you know that the scariest part of this whole thing won&#x2019;t be the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/in-vitro-fertilization/about/pac-20384716&#x22;&#x3E;egg retrieval procedure&#x3C;/a&#x3E; itself (though, to be fair, the idea of a needle traversing through your vagina and into your ovaries to slurp out a bunch of hormonally induced eggs will take a minute to get comfortable with.) \n\nNo &#x2014; it&#x2019;s the two weeks leading up to the procedure that the real fun happens. And by &#x201C;fun&#x201D; I mean a rigorous schedule of twice-daily, self-administered hormone injections that would make even the most practiced factory chicken tremble.\n\nSo I&#x2019;m not going to sugarcoat this. \n\nWaking up at the buttcrack of dawn every other day to get your blood drawn at a cold, depressing fertility clinic; shooting yourself with a syringe full of hormones twice every day (the moment you wake up and every night before you go to bed); feeling &#x2014; and watching &#x2014; as your ovaries swell to several times their normal size within the course of days &#x2014; none of it is easy. It gets better after a couple of times, but those first few days will be scary (and for those with any discomfort around needles &#x2014; straight up harrowing). And on top of all that &#x2014; some of the medicine requires precise mixing of powders and solvents, temperature control, and timing. And if you mess up any one of those variables, it can be a big deal and ruin your whole retrieval cycle.\n\n&#x3C;b&#x3E;That being said: while by no means a piece of cake &#x2014; it&#x2019;s all doable.&#x3C;/b&#x3E; After the first couple of days, the shots become routine and the mixing and timing almost second-nature. You learn what tips and tricks work for you. For me, it was icing the area for your shots 10-15 minutes before each one, injecting the solution very slowly so as to make its entry into your system less shocking (and therefore less painful), and recording each shot location and timestamp in my notepad app to ensure I wasn&#x2019;t missing doses and wasn&#x2019;t shooting myself repeatedly in the same place. Truth be told: the shots themselves don&#x2019;t really hurt that much. The needles are so thin and small they&#x2019;re hardly painful. But wrapping your mind around all of it, and convincing yourself this is worth doing for 14 or so days, can be tough. That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s important to remind yourself that yes, this will suck &#x2014;but it&#x2019;s all tolerable with the right attitude, organization and discipline. I&#x2019;m a total disorganized wimp, and I survived. So let that be an inspiration to you all!</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"339\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/9/10/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-24363-1518191720-1.jpg\" width=\"508\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">I didn&#x2019;t know that you could die from egg freezing. (It&#x2019;s super rare and probably won&#x2019;t happen to you &#x2014; &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4467930/&#x22;&#x3E;but it can happen&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.) I also didn&#x2019;t know that the long-term effects of extended and recurring hormone stimulation are still unclear. So before you decide to go through with the process, read up as much as you can about all the risk factors involved (ovarian torsions, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, hormonal side effects and retrieval complications, and the emotional risks of this procedure...to name a few.) Here&#x2019;s a good place to start reading about the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blog.scrcivf.com/egg-freezing-risks-side-effects&#x22;&#x3E;side effects of freezing your eggs&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. While the worst case scenarios are definitely in the minority &#x2014; I would still advise being as informed as possible about any possible risks before committing yourself to this elective procedure.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"95\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/9/10/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/anigif_sub-buzz-23554-1518189754-3.gif\" width=\"200\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">One moment I was lying supine on a hospital gurney, legs in stirrups, listening to Kansas blaring from a shitty radio while a group of doctors and nurses nonchalantly scuffled around me prepping various drugs and apparati for my egg retrieval. The next, I was staring out the window onto a big parking lot, unsure of where I was or what had just happened. My friend/ersatz partner Brent appeared by my bedside, and I started putting together the pieces of where I was (the hospital) and what I had just done (scooped out my 20 factory-farmed eggs). The anesthesia had rendered me pretty useless, so Brent escorted me home in a taxi while I slowly regained mobility and full consciousness. We ordered food and he hung out with me until I fell asleep. Without him, I don&#x2019;t know how I would have managed to get through that day.\n\nYou&#x2019;re freezing your eggs because for whatever reason, you are not in a place in your life to start a family, yet there is a piece of you that knows you still want the chance one day. That can be a lonely reality to come to terms with. \n\nBut don&#x2019;t let that make you turn inward or alienate yourself from people who want to support you through what will be an emotionally stressful process. I was lucky to have great friends and family with whom I was very open about my fears and experience. I also had two friends who had gone through multiple egg retrieval cycles before and who offered their help or guidance any time of day, with any issue. My on-again, off-again boyfriend in California at the time was also a rock during the process &#x2014; even FaceTiming with me the first couple of times I took my shots. I knew they were in my corner &#x2014; even if only virtually &#x2014; which helped me face each day without breaking down.\n\nAnd you&#x2019;ll also be pleasantly surprised by the number of welcoming, helpful communities there are online to support you &#x2014; and even make you laugh. BuzzFeed&#x2019;s own Doree Shafrir has built a thriving community around her fantastic podcast &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://eggcellentadventure.com/&#x22;&#x3E;Matt and Doree&#x2019;s Eggcelent Adventure&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, which chronicles (with refreshing candidness and levity) her experiences in IVF with her partner, Matt. Though focused primarily on people undergoing IVF rather than egg freezing, Matt and Doree&#x2019;s podcast and facebook group helped me feel like I wasn&#x2019;t alone, and that there was a lot I could learn about myself and even laugh about through this process. I highly recommend you find and join support groups like these to learn more and prepare for your procedure.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"200\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/9/10/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/anigif_sub-buzz-22743-1518189961-16.gif\" width=\"200\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">If you&#x2019;re with a partner with whom having a family with is not completely out of the question &#x2014; or if you&#x2019;re considering a sperm donor for future baby potential, freezing an embryo might be something worth considering. After reading through many forums and blogs on the matter, I found that one of the biggest regrets among women struggling through unsuccessful IVF rounds (using both fresh and frozen eggs/embryos) is that they didn&#x2019;t freeze embryos at an earlier age. Eggs are more fragile than embryos, meaning there is a higher chance that some can be lost in the freezing, thawing, and fertilization process. So if a decent sperm donor is in the picture now &#x2014; it won&#x2019;t hurt to look into options beyond egg preservation.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"231\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/9/10/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/anigif_sub-buzz-12372-1518190316-2.gif\" width=\"500\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">One of the best pieces of wisdom I received from a friend who had gone through this process was, &#x201C;Do NOT make any big decisions during your hormone treatment. Your brain isn&#x2019;t your brain for those weeks. Don&#x2019;t trust it.&#x201D; I tried to heed her advice. But when hormone injections push your estrogen to 10x times their baseline level, and your stomach has bloated to the size of a small watermelon, and you&#x2019;re alone, staring at yourself in the mirror for the 13th day in the row jabbing a needle into your thigh &#x2014; feelings get stirred. It&#x2019;s okay to feel not okay. It&#x2019;s important to step back and remind yourself that what you&#x2019;re doing is a big deal on a cosmic level: you&#x2019;re using science to control your future reproduction. It&#x2019;s terrifying, miraculous, empowering, and traumatizing at the same time. You&#x2019;re going to have mood swings at times. The key is to be ready for them, and to set up preventative measures to keep yourself from spiraling into a hormonally-charged tailspin. Have a sponsor to text whenever you&#x2019;re feeling especially emotional. Delete your ex-partners&#x2019; phone numbers. Give your social media passwords to a good friend for the month. Do all that you can to protect yourself from letting the hormones get the best of you.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"250\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/9/10/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/anigif_sub-buzz-12356-1518190496-9.gif\" width=\"220\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Even if elective oocyte cryopreservation is technically covered by your employer &#x2014; prepare to shell out at least $1000 for this whole thing &#x2014; and without coverage, in the ballpark of $10k. And some costs you should consider (that likely will *not* be covered by insurance, no matter how plush your company benefits) are&#x2026;\n\n* $500-1500/year storage fee to pay to keep your lil&#x2019; buggers on ice\n* $600+ for fertility drugs (much of which you won&#x2019;t actually use, but you&#x2019;ll be instructed to purchase more than enough of, &#x201C;just in case&#x201D;) \n* $1K-10K for another round of egg retrieval, if the first round results in fewer eggs than you&#x2019;d anticipated (they say a &#x201C;good round&#x201D; is 10 eggs or more, but it could be less or more)\n\nTL;DR: With insurance/employer coverage or not: financially, this is no small investment. Fertility treatments are glimpses into the wild bio-hacked future.

They&#39;re literally paid to have sex. Professionally. Like it&#39;s a goddamn sport. Hey, it might as well be. Having sex <i>is</i> technically a form of physical activity, especially when you consider how much and how often porn stars are doing it. And with porn viewership growing every year &mdash; total visits to PornHub grew from 21.2 billion in <a href=\"https://www.pornhub.com/insights/pornhub-2015-year-in-review\">2015</a> to 28.5 billion in <a href=\"https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2017-year-in-review\">2017</a> &mdash; you can expect there to be a lot more fucking to come.</p>\n\n<p>Knowing that, we thought it&#39;d be interesting to find out what porn stars really think people need to know about sex, and that maybe we could learn a few things from the people who&#39;ve (most likely) had it more than anyone else. Especially because porn can influence what people think sex <i>should</i> be &mdash; giving them unrealistic expectations of bodies, performance, and positions, among other things. So, we spoke to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/moriahmillss/\">Moriah Mills</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Donnie_Rock69\">Donnie Rock</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iamjasonluv\">Jason Luv</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/misstoriblack\">Tori Black</a>.

It&#39;s worth mentioning, though, because there&#39;s lots of porn that might SEEM real &mdash; calling you out, amateur porn &mdash; when, actually, it all comes from a script. In fact, the actors will usually know exactly which sex acts are involved before the shoot is even booked, since their rates can depend on things like how much dialogue there is or how dangerous the fetishes being filmed are, Black tells BuzzFeed Health.</p>\n\n<p>Even if it is real sex, it&#39;s still a performance, Mills tells BuzzFeed Health. There aren&#39;t any emotions involved like there would be in real-life sex, and sometimes there might not even be any chemistry between the two (or more) people having sex. Sometimes, the actors aren&#39;t meeting the people they&#39;ll be shooting with until the day of the shoot. \"You never really meet the young lady until the actual scene,\" Luv tells BuzzFeed Health. \"They feel like that builds up the sexual tension by not seeing them. But I feel like you should talk to them for at least 30 minutes to an hour first to at least get the likes and dislikes out of the way.\"</p>\n\n<p>In some ways, working in porn is just like having regular work relationships. Your reputation in the industry matters, and people tend to work with people they like, if they can. \"It&#39;s a tight-knit community, so reputations spread like wildfire,\" Black says.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Screen Gems / Via <a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"http://meghanfizzy.tumblr.com/post/38627204972/every-3rd-gif-this-is-you-this-is-your-best\">meghanfizzy.tumblr.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>Actually, most of the positions you see in porn aren't meant to be done IRL, either.</h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-02/9/12/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/anigif_sub-buzz-16727-1518197967-26.gif\" width=\"500\" height=\"271\" alt=\"Actually, most of the positions you see in porn aren't meant to be done IRL, either.\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>I could list a whole lot of positions, but just watch some porn &mdash; you&#39;ll surely spot a position (or three) that look uncomfortable or difficult. All of these positions are done for the sake of a good camera shot. Porn stars are told to \"open up for the camera,\" Mills says, so that the sex act and whatever fetishes or kinks are featured in the porn can be seen at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>\"I shoot a lot of foot fetish scenes, so you&#39;re fucking her feet a lot, and every time you&#39;re having sex with her, the feet are in the shot,\" Rock says. \"I&#39;m never going to fuck like that at home because it&#39;s very awkward. I have to pull her feet around so that they&#39;re right by the penetration; so that it&#39;s in the same shot on camera.\"</p>\n\n<p>Now, that&#39;s not to say you can&#39;t practice these positions when you get down. \"You can do those in real life if your partner is adventurous or knows how to do those things,\" Mills says, emphasizing that you should be strong enough and have the stamina to do them, too.</p>\n\n<p>Why? Because sometimes it&#39;s really hard holding these positions, Luv says. \"People try to do that in their regular life, and I&#39;m like, &#39;Dude, you&#39;re definitely about to lose your wood trying to do that position,&#39;\" he says. \"Sometimes I be shaking because holding the position causes so much [stress] on the muscles. My whole body be shaking. You can&#39;t tell in the videos, but I&#39;m like, &#39;Yo, how many more minutes we have in this position?\"</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Universal Pictures / Via <a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/filme-eS1VNeQtR2SHu\">giphy.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>There are a bunch of reasons dudes last so long in porn, and TBH, Viagra isn't always one of them.</h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-02/11/22/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/anigif_sub-buzz-12478-1518407357-19.gif\" width=\"500\" height=\"275\" alt=\"There are a bunch of reasons dudes last so long in porn, and TBH, Viagra isn't always one of them.\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>It&#39;s one of the most common questions from people outside the industry, Luv says. Sure, there are people in porn who use Viagra, injection therapy, or those <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/caseygueren/those-convenience-store-penis-pills-actually-contain\">gas station pills</a> with really absurd names. But both Rock and Luv say you don&#39;t need those if you can train your mind and distract yourself. Fortunately for them, there are A LOT of distractions on a porn set.</p>\n\n<p>\"You just have to focus your mind on other things outside of the tingling sensation that you get on your penis,\" Luv says. \"Change the movement and the pace, and start thinking about something else.\" That \"something else\" can be anything, they say. \"If I feel like I&#39;m going to come, I just glance over at the camera guy or something,\" Rock says.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s also the fact that no porn star goes all the way through a scene without taking a break. It&#39;s never 30 minutes to an hour of straight pounding, Rock says. \"We&#39;re stopping in-between positions, drinking water, moving the camera,\" and that&#39;s just enough time to think about other things and desensitize the penis, Luv says. So, if you&#39;re trying to figure this out yourself, try taking a quick water break, switching positions, or, as Rock does, teasing your partner a bit before jumping back in.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Comedy Central / Via <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/mattortile/you-aint-right-for-doing-it-to-me-like-that-daddy?utm_term=.xpjdljLVO#.rh3LK3V0z\">buzzfeed.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>And while we're talking about penises, good sex has <i>nothing</i> to do with penis size.

You&#39;ll want to see if they&#39;re into it, if it&#39;s too far outside of their comfort zone, or if they have any concerns about it. You might not want to bring it up while actually having sex, because it could ruin the moment, Rock says. But also, it&rsquo;s safer to ask your partner about trying something new ahead of time rather than asking them in the moment and potentially making them feel uncomfortable. </p>\n\n<p>If you and your partner are <i>really</i> interested in expanding your sexual repertoire, Luv says that besides talking to them about what you&#39;d like to do, you should also list your fetishes on a piece of paper, and then swap. See which fetishes are not too far outside of your comfort zone and commit to completing at least one thing on the list every month. \"It&#39;s going to make for a vastly improved sex life,\" he says.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that doing anything new will force you to step outside your comfort zone, even if it&#39;s only a little bit.

Another truth: Actors who shoot porn go through mandatory testing for sexually transmitted infections every 14 days, if not more frequently. Their results are also submitted to an online database called <a href=\"https://fscpass.com/\">PASS</a>, so that everyone involved in shooting the scene can verify that the actors&#39; information is up to date. In many ways, porn stars are having safer sex than the general population.</p>\n\n<p>\"This is the safest I&#39;ve ever been in my life when it comes to sex,\" Mills says. \"When you&#39;re out in the real world, people lie about their status. Some people don&#39;t even get tested.\" In fact, all the actors interviewed for this post agreed that porn sex is MUCH safer than IRL sex. \"Since I&#39;ve been doing porn, it&#39;s put fear into me in real life, because I don&#39;t want to have sex with other girls. You ask them to get tested and they act like you asked them to cut off their right leg and hand it to you,\" Luv says. \"As a professional, that&#39;s your career. My penis is my paycheck.

They&#x27;re literally paid to have sex. Professionally. Like it&#x27;s a goddamn sport. Hey, it might as well be. Having sex &#x3C;i&#x3E;is&#x3C;/i&#x3E; technically a form of physical activity, especially when you consider how much and how often porn stars are doing it. And with porn viewership growing every year &#x2014; total visits to PornHub grew from 21.2 billion in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.pornhub.com/insights/pornhub-2015-year-in-review&#x22;&#x3E;2015&#x3C;/a&#x3E; to 28.5 billion in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2017-year-in-review&#x22;&#x3E;2017&#x3C;/a&#x3E; &#x2014; you can expect there to be a lot more fucking to come.\n\nKnowing that, we thought it&#x27;d be interesting to find out what porn stars really think people need to know about sex, and that maybe we could learn a few things from the people who&#x27;ve (most likely) had it more than anyone else. Especially because porn can influence what people think sex &#x3C;i&#x3E;should&#x3C;/i&#x3E; be &#x2014; giving them unrealistic expectations of bodies, performance, and positions, among other things. So, we spoke to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.instagram.com/moriahmillss/&#x22;&#x3E;Moriah Mills&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/Donnie_Rock69&#x22;&#x3E;Donnie Rock&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/iamjasonluv&#x22;&#x3E;Jason Luv&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/misstoriblack&#x22;&#x3E;Tori Black&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Here&#x27;s what they had to say.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"228\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/9/12/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/anigif_sub-buzz-28061-1518197789-1.gif\" width=\"500\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">I mean, obviously, right? It&#x27;s worth mentioning, though, because there&#x27;s lots of porn that might SEEM real &#x2014; calling you out, amateur porn &#x2014; when, actually, it all comes from a script. In fact, the actors will usually know exactly which sex acts are involved before the shoot is even booked, since their rates can depend on things like how much dialogue there is or how dangerous the fetishes being filmed are, Black tells BuzzFeed Health.\n\nEven if it is real sex, it&#x27;s still a performance, Mills tells BuzzFeed Health. There aren&#x27;t any emotions involved like there would be in real-life sex, and sometimes there might not even be any chemistry between the two (or more) people having sex. Sometimes, the actors aren&#x27;t meeting the people they&#x27;ll be shooting with until the day of the shoot. &#x22;You never really meet the young lady until the actual scene,&#x22; Luv tells BuzzFeed Health. &#x22;They feel like that builds up the sexual tension by not seeing them. But I feel like you should talk to them for at least 30 minutes to an hour first to at least get the likes and dislikes out of the way.&#x22;\n\nIn some ways, working in porn is just like having regular work relationships. Your reputation in the industry matters, and people tend to work with people they like, if they can. &#x22;It&#x27;s a tight-knit community, so reputations spread like wildfire,&#x22; Black says.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"271\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/9/12/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/anigif_sub-buzz-16727-1518197967-26.gif\" width=\"500\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">I could list a whole lot of positions, but just watch some porn &#x2014; you&#x27;ll surely spot a position (or three) that look uncomfortable or difficult. All of these positions are done for the sake of a good camera shot. Porn stars are told to &#x22;open up for the camera,&#x22; Mills says, so that the sex act and whatever fetishes or kinks are featured in the porn can be seen at the same time.\n\n&#x22;I shoot a lot of foot fetish scenes, so you&#x27;re fucking her feet a lot, and every time you&#x27;re having sex with her, the feet are in the shot,&#x22; Rock says. &#x22;I&#x27;m never going to fuck like that at home because it&#x27;s very awkward. I have to pull her feet around so that they&#x27;re right by the penetration; so that it&#x27;s in the same shot on camera.&#x22;\n\nNow, that&#x27;s not to say you can&#x27;t practice these positions when you get down. &#x22;You can do those in real life if your partner is adventurous or knows how to do those things,&#x22; Mills says, emphasizing that you should be strong enough and have the stamina to do them, too.\n\nWhy? Because sometimes it&#x27;s really hard holding these positions, Luv says. &#x22;People try to do that in their regular life, and I&#x27;m like, &#x27;Dude, you&#x27;re definitely about to lose your wood trying to do that position,&#x27;&#x22; he says. &#x22;Sometimes I be shaking because holding the position causes so much [stress] on the muscles. My whole body be shaking. You can&#x27;t tell in the videos, but I&#x27;m like, &#x27;Yo, how many more minutes we have in this position?&#x22;</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"275\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/11/22/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/anigif_sub-buzz-12478-1518407357-19.gif\" width=\"500\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">It&#x27;s one of the most common questions from people outside the industry, Luv says. Sure, there are people in porn who use Viagra, injection therapy, or those &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/caseygueren/those-convenience-store-penis-pills-actually-contain&#x22;&#x3E;gas station pills&#x3C;/a&#x3E; with really absurd names. But both Rock and Luv say you don&#x27;t need those if you can train your mind and distract yourself. Fortunately for them, there are A LOT of distractions on a porn set.\n\n&#x22;You just have to focus your mind on other things outside of the tingling sensation that you get on your penis,&#x22; Luv says. &#x22;Change the movement and the pace, and start thinking about something else.&#x22; That &#x22;something else&#x22; can be anything, they say. &#x22;If I feel like I&#x27;m going to come, I just glance over at the camera guy or something,&#x22; Rock says.\n\nThere&#x27;s also the fact that no porn star goes all the way through a scene without taking a break. It&#x27;s never 30 minutes to an hour of straight pounding, Rock says. &#x22;We&#x27;re stopping in-between positions, drinking water, moving the camera,&#x22; and that&#x27;s just enough time to think about other things and desensitize the penis, Luv says. So, if you&#x27;re trying to figure this out yourself, try taking a quick water break, switching positions, or, as Rock does, teasing your partner a bit before jumping back in.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"353\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/9/12/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/anigif_sub-buzz-17318-1518198267-3.gif?resize=625:353\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">If you have a penis, then you&#x27;ve probably &#x2014; at least once! &#x2014; been self-conscious about your penis size.

In fact, the vast majority of penises aren&#x27;t HUGE and they aren&#x27;t small &#x2014; &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/caseygueren/hard-facts-about-penis-size&#x22;&#x3E;they&#x27;re right in-between&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, with the average erect length being 5.17 inches. &#x22;All you have to do is figure out how to use what you got,&#x22; and be confident in your sex game, she says. &#x22;You can&#x27;t be saying, &#x27;Oh, I don&#x27;t have a big one, so I&#x27;m not able to be good. It&#x27;s a cop-out. You&#x27;ve got all sorts of resources; figure it out.&#x22;\n\nSomething to remember: &#x22;You&#x27;re not really good at it unless you can satisfy your partner,&#x22; says Rock.

So if you&#x27;re interested in, say, outdoor sex, double-penetration orgy sex, sex while smoking cigarettes, etc., it&#x27;s all there for you.\n\n&#x22;I&#x2019;m grateful for the opportunity to help people explore themselves,&#x22; Black says. &#x22;I feel like people lump themselves to the side of the buffet that they know, and they just have so much more of it. But just take a nibble off of a table you&#x2019;ve never been to. Sometimes you just gotta get out there...and explore. There are so many feelings and smells and tastes. Things to hear and listen to.&#x22;</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"278\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/9/13/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/anigif_sub-buzz-28720-1518199474-4.gif\" width=\"500\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Porn can give people new ideas, new positions, and different levels of passion to imitate, Luv says. &#x22;I like to think it helps people&#x27;s marriages and relationships, and keeps the sexual tension up.&#x22;\n\nSo if you see a new position, kink, or fantasy that you want to act out, talk to your partner about it. You&#x27;ll want to see if they&#x27;re into it, if it&#x27;s too far outside of their comfort zone, or if they have any concerns about it. You might not want to bring it up while actually having sex, because it could ruin the moment, Rock says. But also, it&#x2019;s safer to ask your partner about trying something new ahead of time rather than asking them in the moment and potentially making them feel uncomfortable. \n\nIf you and your partner are &#x3C;i&#x3E;really&#x3C;/i&#x3E; interested in expanding your sexual repertoire, Luv says that besides talking to them about what you&#x27;d like to do, you should also list your fetishes on a piece of paper, and then swap. See which fetishes are not too far outside of your comfort zone and commit to completing at least one thing on the list every month. &#x22;It&#x27;s going to make for a vastly improved sex life,&#x22; he says.\n\nKeep in mind that doing anything new will force you to step outside your comfort zone, even if it&#x27;s only a little bit. But you&#x27;re also going to learn what you really do and don&#x27;t like, and that&#x27;s both empowering and sexually liberating, says Black.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"213\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/9/13/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/anigif_sub-buzz-29189-1518200099-1.gif\" width=\"500\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Whether it&#x27;s a fantasy like role-playing, something more straightforward like anal sex, or just plain sticking your fingers in your partner&#x27;s mouth, you&#x27;ll be better off easing into it rather than going full force from the jump. Paying attention to how your partner responds through body language, and then adjusting accordingly, is key, Rock says.\n\n&#x22;You can feel it in the energy,&#x22; says Black. &#x22;In their eyes...goosebumps are a real thing. Muscle twitches. It heightens your awareness of another person. When you cater to someone and you pay attention to someone sexually, you find that your relationship improves because they feel catered to &#x2014; like you&#x27;re paying attention to them, like you&#x27;re listening.&#x22;\n\nYour partner will probably feel more appreciated if you pay attention, Black says, noting that people often feel vulnerable during sex. Conversely, neglecting your partner&#x27;s interest in everything you&#x27;re doing to them could make them feel uncomfortable, violated, or taken advantage of.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"313\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/9/13/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/sub-buzz-31303-1518201478-1.jpg?resize=625:313\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Maybe you don&#x27;t really like the position you&#x27;re in. Maybe your partner is trying a new kink out on you and all of a sudden you feel weird about it. Maybe &#x3C;i&#x3E;you&#x27;re&#x3C;/i&#x3E; the one trying to get your partner to have sex, but they&#x27;re just not into it at the moment.\n\nLook, rejection sucks. But sometimes you just have to take it. Sometimes, you have to be the one to reject someone. Either one is totally fine, and there shouldn&#x27;t be any repercussions for it. We&#x27;re all humans with our own emotions and thought processes, and sometimes we feel good about things, sometimes we don&#x27;t.\n\n&#x22;Sometimes I want to be cuddled and made love to. Sometimes I want to be really nasty,&#x22; Black says. Communicating how you feel is important in these instances, she says. And if you&#x27;re on the receiving end, have patience. &#x22;Remember that your partner&#x27;s response doesn&#x2019;t necessarily have anything to do with their comfort level with you. It&#x2019;s just how they&#x2019;re feeling. It&#x2019;s just what&#x2019;s going on in their life. Maybe tonight&#x2019;s not a good time. Maybe next week will be, or next month.&#x22;</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"272\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/9/13/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/anigif_sub-buzz-31304-1518201710-3.gif\" width=\"500\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Not everything you try will be easy or feel good the first time you do it. So if you&#x27;re thinking about getting into some bondage, read up on the types of things you&#x27;d use to tie someone up before getting a random set of ropes and tying them into a knot you can&#x27;t undo. If you&#x27;re prepping to get down with anal sex, figure out the best ways to prepare your butthole for it.\n\nCase in point: &#x22;I did anal for the first time last month. I did it cold turkey, and it&#x2019;s really different than regular vaginal. You really need to lube up and just prepare yourself... It was an experience,&#x22; Mills says, adding that there was definitely some pain. &#x22;But towards the end, it became pleasurable.&#x22; So, sure, it may take some time getting comfortable with new kinds of sex, but it will happen, and chances are the more prepared you are for it, the more pleasurable it&#x27;ll be.\n\nAlso, quick side note: If you&#x27;re ever unsure, lube it up. If you think you&#x27;re good without it, THINK AGAIN. Lube. It. Up.\n &#x1F44F; &#x1F44F; &#x1F44F;</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"540\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/9/13/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-30888-1518202530-3.png?resize=625:540\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x22;It&#x27;s the warm-up to the main event,&#x22; Rock says. And though it might also depend on what you&#x27;re into, I think we can all agree that at least a little foreplay can elevate the experience. &#x22;Exciting them excites me,&#x22; Rock says, and that should be your approach to sex too.\n\nForeplay doesn&#x27;t have to involve crazy tricks or take too long, either. Sometimes, a good kiss is good enough, Mills and Black say. &#x22;The chemistry and passion get me off the most, more so than the act of sex alone,&#x22; Black says. &#x22;Give me one good, solid, passionate kiss, and I&#x27;m going to feel it through my whole body. ... I can&#x27;t imagine trying to have sex without any kind of foreplay. At least kiss my neck; give me something.&#x22;</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Let&#x27;s keep it real: Perfect sex does not exist. It can be messy, loud, chaotic. Sometimes it&#x27;s even hilarious. And porn shows none of this. &#x22;There are very few scenes that I have shot in my career that have flowed from start to finish with no awkward leg movements or fumbling from one position when you really weren&#x2019;t supposed to be in that position,&#x22; says Black. Silly things happen, everybody laughs, and these parts are edited out. &#x22;So people feel like they need to put on this flawless performance, and I think that&#x2019;s a huge, unfortunate misconception &#x2014; people judge themselves because they do something silly and it ruins their moment, ruins their vibe.&#x22;\n\nIt&#x27;s definitely easier saying it, but try ignoring those thoughts of being judged for having sex that you enjoy, especially if that judgment comes from societal views of how sex should be. &#x22;I know a lot of women who are embarrassed because they enjoy giving oral sex. They think it&#x27;s degrading. And I say, &#x27;Why would you think that&#x27;s degrading if it&#x27;s something you enjoy?&#x27;&#x22; Black says. &#x22;It&#x27;s only degrading once you put external judgment on the act. No one&#x27;s in your bedroom, and if you&#x27;re performing oral sex on someone who&#x27;s going to judge you for giving oral sex, then I think something&#x27;s really wrong.&#x22;\n\nActually, if you feel like you&#x27;re going to be judged in any way, laughed at, or feel like you can&#x27;t be yourself during ~the thing~, then it might be worth considering how comfortable you are with the person. &#x22;If I can&#x27;t laugh about it, then that means I&#x27;m uncomfortable, and if I&#x27;m uncomfortable then I&#x27;m not going to orgasm,&#x22; says Black. &#x22;And if I&#x27;m not going to orgasm, why am I even having sex?&#x22;</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"video\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Truth: Porn stars often have sex without condoms. Another truth: Actors who shoot porn go through mandatory testing for sexually transmitted infections every 14 days, if not more frequently. Their results are also submitted to an online database called &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://fscpass.com/&#x22;&#x3E;PASS&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, so that everyone involved in shooting the scene can verify that the actors&#x27; information is up to date. In many ways, porn stars are having safer sex than the general population.\n\n&#x22;This is the safest I&#x27;ve ever been in my life when it comes to sex,&#x22; Mills says. &#x22;When you&#x27;re out in the real world, people lie about their status. Some people don&#x27;t even get tested.&#x22; In fact, all the actors interviewed for this post agreed that porn sex is MUCH safer than IRL sex. &#x22;Since I&#x27;ve been doing porn, it&#x27;s put fear into me in real life, because I don&#x27;t want to have sex with other girls. You ask them to get tested and they act like you asked them to cut off their right leg and hand it to you,&#x22; Luv says. &#x22;As a professional, that&#x27;s your career. My penis is my paycheck. Without it, I can&#x27;t clock in.&#x22;\n\nSo get tested at least every couple of months, Rock says, especially if you&#x27;re having sex with multiple partners. And use condoms every time.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n    <media:player url=\"https://instagram.com/p/Be4JKTfF7qp/\" />\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"270\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/9/14/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/anigif_sub-buzz-20003-1518202915-20.gif\" width=\"480\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">OK, maybe not &#x3C;i&#x3E;outside&#x3C;/i&#x3E; out there, but you know what we mean.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n</media:group>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>22 Sexting Tips You&#x2019;ll Want To Put To Good Use Immediately</title>\n<link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/annaborges/how-to-sext?utm_term=4ldqpia</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\n<p>First of all, NO UNSOLICITED DICK PICS.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>To help you out, we asked members of the <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/community\">BuzzFeed Community</a> for their <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/annaborges/tell-us-your-sexting-tips?utm_term=.nsgaOprBDY#.kiz2q1PDpY\">best sexting tips</a>.

According to the the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the 2017&ndash;18 influenza outbreak has now led to the <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/danvergano/flu-season-child-deaths?utm_term=.lrBJKjK0M#.fjJ2AoA87\">highest measured hospitalization rates</a> for the virus. </p>\n\n<p>\"This is a very difficult flu season,\" acting CDC director Anne Schuchat told reporters last week. \"We are not out of the woods yet.\" There are still weeks to go in this flu season, and cases can pop up as late as April and May. Although flu activity is starting to go down in Western states, such as California, it&#39;s still high in the rest of the US and increasing on the East Coast.</p>\n\n<p>There are three strains circulating this year: H3N2, H1N1, and influenza B. The prevailing strain, H3N2, is known for being particularly vicious and is likely to cause more complications and deaths among the very old and very young.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Science Picture Co / Getty Images / Via <a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/license/107702711\">gettyimages.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>The flu kills children every year, so this isn't unusual.

When the flu kills children, it typically does so by overwhelming the cardiorespiratory system or causing a secondary infection, such as pneumonia.</p>\n\n<p>\"Children, like the elderly, also struggle to stay hydrated and end up under-eating when they have the flu, which puts them at higher risk,\" Jacobson says. During most flu seasons, the hospitalization rates for children are typically the same or just below those for people over 65.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Hero Images / Getty Images / Via <a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/license/536907691\">gettyimages.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>Most healthy children will recover from the flu \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but some can develop life-threatening complications.</h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-02/8/18/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-18909-1518131587-25.jpg?resize=625:417\" width=\"625\" height=\"417\" alt=\"Most healthy children will recover from the flu \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but some can develop life-threatening complications.\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>Typically, healthy children who get the flu will recover within a week or so. Children who are at high risk of serious complications from the flu include those under the age of five (especially under the age of two), children with an underlying chronic health problem, such as asthma or diabetes, an immunodeficiency disorder, or who require immunosuppression therapy, and those with neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Anna Pekunova / Getty Images / Via <a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/license/454196389\">gettyimages.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>If your child gets sick and they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in a high-risk category, keep them home and treat any symptoms as necessary.</h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-02/8/18/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/sub-buzz-8146-1518131788-7.jpg?resize=625:416\" width=\"625\" height=\"416\" alt=\"If your child gets sick and they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in a high-risk category, keep them home and treat any symptoms as necessary.\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>In children, flu symptoms can include a fever, chills, fatigue, vomiting, aches, cough, and congestion. A doctor can do a rapid flu test in the office with a nasal swab to confirm the diagnosis.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s important for the child to get plenty of rest, fluids, and proper nutrition to help the body as it fights off illness. Over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen (the preferred options for kids) can ease some symptoms, but make sure you adjust the dose for a child per the medication instructions. Children should never be given aspirin due to the risk of Reye&rsquo;s syndrome, a rare condition that can harm the liver and brain.</p>\n\n<p>Most important, keep your child out of school and have them stay home until they are better, Jacobson says. Staying home from school is both better for recovery and it helps prevent the spread of illness to other schoolchildren.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Tetra Images / Getty Images / Via <a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/license/525446285\">gettyimages.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>The flu can progress very quickly.

If your child has any of these symptoms, you should seek medical care &mdash; whether that means going to the doctor or urgent care or an emergency room. \"If the child goes into respiratory distress or shows signs of collapsing, call 911 right away,\" Jacobson says.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing parents should watch out for is a fever that comes back after going away. \"Anyone who has had a fever that went away for at least three days and came back should go to the hospital or doctor&#39;s office, because this could be a sign of a bacterial infection in the lungs &mdash; even if it&#39;s just a middle ear or sinus infection, you should get it checked out; it could be life-threatening,\" Jacobson says.</p>\n\n<p>Most important, parents should trust their instincts.

Antivirals can also help prevent serious complications from the flu, such as pneumonia. \"Anyone who is high risk should get treated with antivirals as early as possible,\" Jacobson says, because they are more vulnerable and can benefit the most from antivirals.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Martin Shields / Getty Images / Via <a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/license/128578329\">gettyimages.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>In past flu seasons, between <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/news/reported-flu-deaths-children.htm\">80% and 85%</a> of flu-related pediatric deaths occurred in children who had not gotten a flu vaccine.</h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-02/8/18/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/sub-buzz-8101-1518131321-7.jpg?resize=625:417\" width=\"625\" height=\"417\" alt=\"In past flu seasons, between 80% and 85% of flu-related pediatric deaths occurred in children who had not gotten a flu vaccine.\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>\"The most important point is that the majority of children who died from the flu in other seasons were unvaccinated &mdash; and no more than half of them had underlying diseases that put them at risk to die from the flu,\" Jacobson says.

The flu vaccine is recommended for most children over the age of six months, and getting older children vaccinated can help protect babies who are too young to be vaccinated themselves. </p>\n\n<p>When you get your children and family vaccinated, you aren&#39;t just protecting yourself. \"You create a halo around loved ones, friends, neighbors, coworkers &mdash; and in kids, we see lower rates of outbreaks in schools with vaccination requirements,\" Jacobson says.</p>\n\n\n <p><small>Douglas Sacha / Getty Images / Via <a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/license/850141074\">gettyimages.com</a></small></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>So if you or your child hasn't gotten a flu shot yet, do it now.

It's not too late.\" /></p>\n \n\t<p>\"If you get your vaccine now, you&#39;re protecting yourself for the rest of the season &mdash; which could go on for months in certain parts of the country,\" Jacobson says. Some children under the age of nine actually require two doses of the flu vaccine, so talk to your doctor about your child&#39;s vaccination needs. \"Getting your kid vaccinated today, even at height of flu season, makes sense because it will protect them for the next few months, but it might also prepare them for next year,\" Jacobson says.</p>\n\n<p>Experts will not know how effective the 2017&ndash;18 flu vaccine is until this season is over, but current predictions are around 17% for H3N2, BuzzFeed News previously reported.

According to the the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the 2017&#x2013;18 influenza outbreak has now led to the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.buzzfeed.com/danvergano/flu-season-child-deaths?utm_term=.lrBJKjK0M#.fjJ2AoA87&#x22;&#x3E;highest measured hospitalization rates&#x3C;/a&#x3E; for the virus. \n\n&#x22;This is a very difficult flu season,&#x22; acting CDC director Anne Schuchat told reporters last week. &#x22;We are not out of the woods yet.&#x22; There are still weeks to go in this flu season, and cases can pop up as late as April and May. Although flu activity is starting to go down in Western states, such as California, it&#x27;s still high in the rest of the US and increasing on the East Coast.\n\nThere are three strains circulating this year: H3N2, H1N1, and influenza B. The prevailing strain, H3N2, is known for being particularly vicious and is likely to cause more complications and deaths among the very old and very young.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content isDefault=\"false\">\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"417\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/8/18/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/sub-buzz-19690-1518131723-3.jpg?resize=625:417\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">The flu killed 101 children last year and 128 in 2014&#x2013;15. &#x22;We had a very serious flu season in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.cdc.gov/flu/news/2014-2015-flu-season-wrapup.htm&#x22;&#x3E;2014&#x2013;2015&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and it&#x27;s looking a lot like that right now,&#x22; &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/jacobson-robert-m-m-d/bio-00083020&#x22;&#x3E;Dr. Robert Jacobson&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, pediatrician and vaccine researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, told BuzzFeed News. \n\nChildren are more vulnerable because their immune and respiratory systems are less mature, Jacobson says, which means they struggle more to fight off a virus like the flu, which puts stress on the heart and lungs. When the flu kills children, it typically does so by overwhelming the cardiorespiratory system or causing a secondary infection, such as pneumonia.\n\n&#x22;Children, like the elderly, also struggle to stay hydrated and end up under-eating when they have the flu, which puts them at higher risk,&#x22; Jacobson says. During most flu seasons, the hospitalization rates for children are typically the same or just below those for people over 65.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"417\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/8/18/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-18909-1518131587-25.jpg?resize=625:417\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">Typically, healthy children who get the flu will recover within a week or so. Children who are at high risk of serious complications from the flu include those under the age of five (especially under the age of two), children with an underlying chronic health problem, such as asthma or diabetes, an immunodeficiency disorder, or who require immunosuppression therapy, and those with neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"416\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/8/18/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/sub-buzz-8146-1518131788-7.jpg?resize=625:416\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">In children, flu symptoms can include a fever, chills, fatigue, vomiting, aches, cough, and congestion. A doctor can do a rapid flu test in the office with a nasal swab to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIt&#x27;s important for the child to get plenty of rest, fluids, and proper nutrition to help the body as it fights off illness. Over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen (the preferred options for kids) can ease some symptoms, but make sure you adjust the dose for a child per the medication instructions. Children should never be given aspirin due to the risk of Reye&#x2019;s syndrome, a rare condition that can harm the liver and brain.\n\nMost important, keep your child out of school and have them stay home until they are better, Jacobson says. Staying home from school is both better for recovery and it helps prevent the spread of illness to other schoolchildren.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"417\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/8/18/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/sub-buzz-8184-1518131424-1.jpg?resize=625:417\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x22;Symptoms to look for in a child are a sudden fever of 102 degrees or higher, persistent fever, difficulty breathing, inability to eat or drink, not urinating for over 8 hours, cottonmouth, sunken eyes, or dizziness,&#x22; Jacobson says. If your child has any of these symptoms, you should seek medical care &#x2014; whether that means going to the doctor or urgent care or an emergency room. &#x22;If the child goes into respiratory distress or shows signs of collapsing, call 911 right away,&#x22; Jacobson says.\n\nAnother thing parents should watch out for is a fever that comes back after going away. &#x22;Anyone who has had a fever that went away for at least three days and came back should go to the hospital or doctor&#x27;s office, because this could be a sign of a bacterial infection in the lungs &#x2014; even if it&#x27;s just a middle ear or sinus infection, you should get it checked out; it could be life-threatening,&#x22; Jacobson says.\n\nMost important, parents should trust their instincts. If, in your gut, you know something is wrong with your child, then call or go see a pediatrician or take them to the hospital.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"339\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/8/18/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-19118-1518131465-7.jpg\" width=\"506\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">If a child is younger than 12 months, has an underlying or complicating illness, or is significantly immunocompromised, skip waiting for the doctor and go straight to the hospital, Jacobson says.\n\nThese high-risk children can be treated with prescription antivirals (like Tamiflu), which can lessen the severity of the flu and shorten its course. Antivirals can also help prevent serious complications from the flu, such as pneumonia. &#x22;Anyone who is high risk should get treated with antivirals as early as possible,&#x22; Jacobson says, because they are more vulnerable and can benefit the most from antivirals.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"417\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/8/18/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/sub-buzz-8101-1518131321-7.jpg?resize=625:417\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x22;The most important point is that the majority of children who died from the flu in other seasons were unvaccinated &#x2014; and no more than half of them had underlying diseases that put them at risk to die from the flu,&#x22; Jacobson says. It&#x27;s unclear how many of the children who died this season were vaccinated, and that information will not be available until the season is over.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"416\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/8/18/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/sub-buzz-8583-1518131817-1.jpg?resize=625:416\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">What can you do to protect your children? &#x22;Based on all our experience over the years, the best thing you can do is to get your kids vaccinated and get everyone else in the house vaccinated,&#x22; Jacobson says. The flu vaccine is recommended for most children over the age of six months, and getting older children vaccinated can help protect babies who are too young to be vaccinated themselves. \n\nWhen you get your children and family vaccinated, you aren&#x27;t just protecting yourself. &#x22;You create a halo around loved ones, friends, neighbors, coworkers &#x2014; and in kids, we see lower rates of outbreaks in schools with vaccination requirements,&#x22; Jacobson says.</media:description>\n    <media:rating scheme=\"urn:simple\">nonadult</media:rating>\n  </media:content>\n  <media:content height=\"417\" isDefault=\"false\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://webappstatic.buzzfeed.com/static/2018-02/8/18/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-19103-1518131268-1.jpg?resize=625:417\" width=\"625\">\n    <media:description type=\"html\">&#x22;If you get your vaccine now, you&#x27;re protecting yourself for the rest of the season &#x2014; which could go on for months in certain parts of the country,&#x22; Jacobson says. Some children under the age of nine actually require two doses of the flu vaccine, so talk to your doctor about your child&#x27;s vaccination needs. &#x22;Getting your kid vaccinated today, even at height of flu season, makes sense because it will protect them for the next few months, but it might also prepare them for next year,&#x22; Jacobson says.\n\nExperts will not know how effective the 2017&#x2013;18 flu vaccine is until this season is over, but current predictions are around 17% for H3N2, BuzzFeed News previously reported. However, the flu shot also protects against H1N1 and influenza B, which have a higher vaccine effectiveness and are also circulating this year.\n\nEven if the flu shot isn&#x27;t super effective, it&#x27;s better to have some protection against the circulating strains than no protection at all.
