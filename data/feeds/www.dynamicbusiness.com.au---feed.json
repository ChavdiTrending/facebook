In this climate, we are more likely to pay attention to personalities rather than scientists, with celebrity and wealth being favoured over wisdom and traditional evidence.</strong></p>\n<p>Indeed, so strong is the cult of personality that our politicians and business leaders have started to cultivate a following. Certainly the superficial appeals to us more than the esoteric and that doesn\u2019t bode well for our intellectual and technological evolution.</p>\n<p>However one thing that hasn\u2019t changed is human nature. We\u2019re still an incredibly compassionate, innovative species and many of our leaders are using their celebrity and money for the good of humanity. Moving away from ego driven motivations, these champions of change are making a big impact.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a list of our top three game changers and why they are the ones to watch&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p>\n<p>If Tony Stark flew off the pages of a comic strip and into real life he\u2019d be Elon Musk. Famed for his keen business insight this visionary billionaire\u2019s near prophetic ability to get in on ground-breaking start-ups makes him accessible and relatable in modern culture.</p>\n<p>Musk\u2019s current focus is overseeing a revolution in the automobile industry which will either see Tesla cars becoming a global standard or force the traditional car manufacturers to innovate and invest in green technology. The future of transportation will be an environmentally friendly one and that\u2019s down to Elon Musk and his dedication to his craft.</p>\n<p>But his talents don\u2019t stop with the mid-market electric car; he also has ideas for implant technology to transfer information directly between a host\u2019s brain and a computer, a hyperloop travel system, space travel and a fossil fuel ending way to store renewable energy.</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll soon unveil a 100-megawatt battery in South Australia\u2014the largest lithium-ion battery in world.</p>\n<p><strong>Bill Gates</strong></p>\n<p>Gates is well-known for what he has given the world in terms of technology. Sir Tim Berners-Lee may have invented the Internet but Bill Gates put an affordable computer in every home and office completely revolutionising the way we work, study and play.</p>\n<p>Microsoft made Bill the richest man in the world \u2013 a title he has shared with Warren Buffet, the investment savant \u2013 and along with his wife Melinda and his friend Buffet he has decided to give away almost all of his wealth.</p>\n<p>The ultra-wealthy are often caricatured as miserly, callous individuals who\u2019d sell their grandmother\u2019s false teeth midway through dinner if there was a profit to be made but the Giving Pledge is challenging that.</p>\n<p>The Giving Pledge is a commitment by wealthy individuals and families to give away more than half of their wealth to causes including poverty eradication, clean water, sanitation, refugee aid, disaster relief, global health, education, women and girls&#8217; empowerment, medical research, arts and culture, criminal justice reform and environmental sustainability.</p>\n<p><strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong></p>\n<p>If Bill Gates changed the world when he made it affordable for almost every home to have a Windows operated PC then Mark Zuckerberg will certainly change the world with his plans for the Internet.</p>\n<p>The Internet is how we communicate, collaborate and educate in the 21<sup>st</sup> century and Zuckerberg is aghast that many communities across the world are either too remote to access the Internet, do not have the infrastructure or simply cannot afford it. Internet access as a fundamental human right is an obvious next step according to the Facebook founder.</p>\n<p>His Free Basics platform gives users the opportunity to access news, health information and, Facebook, of course, for free. It is hoped that this improved connectivity will boost economic activity and gift opportunities to disadvantaged users.</p>\n<p>These billionaires are using their money and influence to change the world one issue at a time. And they aren\u2019t just spending money; they are actively involved in the day to day operations of everything they do. These are the leaders who are taking humanity forward.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>About the author</strong></p>\n<p><em><img class=\"size-full wp-image-78882 alignleft\" src=\"http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/canva-photo-editor-459-e1502674996510.png\" alt=\"Maria Bellissimo-Magrin\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />Maria Bellissimo-Magrin\u00a0is the CEO of\u00a0full-service creative marketing agency\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.belgrin.com.au/en/home/\">Belgrin</a>.

While these exclusive alliances may appear different on the surface, the reality is that they are more present than ever \u2013 and are perhaps even more impenetrable.</p>\n<p>Historically speaking, boys clubs had little need to hide. They weren\u2019t discriminating, or so they\u2019d argue, it was simply \u2018the way things were\u2019. But now in the era of <a href=\"https://metoomvmt.org\">#metoo</a>, these clubs are far more covert and members are much deeper in denial of their own actions.</p>\n<p>As Maxwell explains in the article, the modern boys clubs usually take place under the guise of shared history, hobbies, interests, or similarities \u2013 things that all seem perfectly innocent, but it\u2019s what these alliances lead to that issues cause for concern.</p>\n<p>Over the course of my career, I\u2019ve seen it time and time again. When gender-based alliances are formed, women will often find themselves excluded from important conversations and major decision making \u2013 which subsequently damages their status and authority over time.</p>\n<p>In male-dominated industries like real estate, there is a particularly strong prevalence of boys clubs. In fact, I believe this is one of the fundamental reasons why the gender pay gap in real estate is actually <em>increasing</em> rather than decreasing, and why women in the industry rarely make it to top level executive positions.</p>\n<p>While of course I believe it\u2019s important to build friendships within the workplace, it\u2019s when this comradery overrides meritocracy and the balance of power becomes skewed that things take a turn for the worst. So, should we accept these new-look boys clubs? I don\u2019t believe so. Here are my reasons why I believe we must take action and see that they are eradicated from the professional world.</p>\n<p><strong>Deep sexist roots</strong></p>\n<p>The concept of boys clubs are deeply rooted in a time where it was believed that a women\u2019s place was in the home, and as such their contribution to the workplace was not valued. According to the most recent <a href=\"https://www.wgea.gov.au/sites/default/files/Stats_at_a_Glance.pdf/\">Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) report</a>, women now make up 46.2% of all employees in Australia, and allowing the patterns of such an outdated way of thinking to continue without question prevents us, as a society, from moving forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Culture of cover up </strong></p>\n<p>One of the most insidious aspects of boys clubs is the cover up culture they breed. Above all else, boys clubs demand loyalty \u2013 even when it\u2019s at the expense of another person. In the recent Harvey Weinstein sexual assault scandal, Rose McGowan has accused Ben Affleck of being complicit in the cover up the actions of Weinstein , who was at the time was helping Affleck to build his own career. While Affleck has firmly denied being aware of the events in question, the accusation alone has led to multiple women coming forth with their own experiences of sexual assault with Weinstein or Affleck himself.</p>\n<p><strong>Irreparable damage</strong></p>\n<p>As a society, it is vital that we acknowledge that the full extent of the damage that boys clubs can inflict on the women of the Australia workforce. The effects of these allegiances are something that most women will feel in their careers at one point or another, whether it takes shape in the form exclusion, discrimination, harassment or assault, boys clubs have the potential to ruin careers and cause emotional scarring that never fully heals.</p>\n<p>Taking a perfunctory approach to knocking this old school way of thinking on the head will not make the inroads we need to. In order to ensure that women within the Australian workplace are not subjected to any form of sexual harassment or sexism, we stand together and reject the outdated ideals of those who been left unchecked for far too long.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>About the author</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Anna Thomas is the Chief Operating Officer of major Australian real estate network, <a href=\"https://www.stockdaleleggo.com.au/\">Stockdale &amp; Leggo</a>.

Even for entrepreneurs who are committed to their business for life, the mere knowledge that they could sell if they chose provides a security blanket.</strong></p>\n<p>However, selling a business can be a complex process. In the case of those that turn a steady profit and pose an appealing sales prospect, there still exist a series of marketing, administrative, and legal hurdles to be cleared before a buyer can be secured.</p>\n<p>Business sale and purchase lawyers from online\u00a0legal services provider, LegalVision, spoke with <em>Dynamic Business</em> about\u00a0the key challenges\u00a0business owners face when selling their businesses \u2013 and how they can best overcome them.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Finding the Right Time</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>According to LegalVision Practice Leader Helen Kay, identifying the correct time to sell a business is of chief importance.</p>\n<p>\u201cTiming is crucial when it comes to selling your business,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cDetermining the best time to sell is an art rather than a science. However, market conditions and industry performance at the time of sale will have an impact on the price you can get for your business.\u201d</p>\n<p>For profitable businesses, Kay recommended that owners sell towards the end of the growth arc to maximise the price. In the case of a &#8220;fading business&#8221; \u2013 in other words, a business with declining revenue \u2013 Kay said the business vendor should temper their expectations.</p>\n<p>\u201cSelling a fading business can be difficult \u2013 declining financial performance is detrimental to the purchase price,\u201d she explained.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn this situation, you could consider selling the business\u2019 equipment through an Agreement to Sell Equipment. This is different to a business sale because you are not selling the business\u2019 goodwill or intellectual property.</p>\n<p>\u201cFailing that, you can implement a transformation strategy for your business, or look to reduce costs by renegotiating agreements with suppliers. This could give you the option to continue trading until business performance improves.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>2. Finding a Buyer</strong></p>\n<p>For first-time business vendors, the search for a buyer can feel like a daunting concept. However, there are a number of resources that exist to connect available businesses to interested parties.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can cast a wide net by advertising your business online, for example, on Seek Business or Gumtree,\u201d said Masao Watanabe, a Business Sale and Purchase Lawyer at LegalVision.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlternatively, a business broker can take on much of the work that\u2019s involved with selling a business and help you promote your business and find a buyer. They can also assist with negotiating some of the terms of the sale with a buyer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Watanabe also suggested looking internally for potential buyers:\u00a0\u201cYou may decide that it is a good idea to tell your employees and suppliers that you are planning on selling \u2013 not only to prevent people panicking about a shotgun sale, but also because you may find a genuine buyer within this group.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>3. Adequately Preparing for the Sale</strong></p>\n<p>While less glamorous than courting a buyer, collecting all pertinent information is no less integral for a business sale.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe information that you collect will give both you and the buyer a clearer understanding of your business and will also help you to identify your business\u2019 strengths and weaknesses,\u201d said LegalVision Business Sale Lawyer Bianca Reynolds.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf your business owns a well-known brand and all of its equipment outright, has a team with a low churn rate and exclusive contracts with reputable suppliers or customers, these are strengths to highlight. On the other hand, a weakness could be that it has experienced a downturn in profits in the past few months or there are issues with intellectual property ownership rights.</p>\n<p>\u201cHaving all the information on hand will also speed up the sale process, and allow the buyer to undertake their due diligence quickly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Relevant sales documents include financial information; business name registration; asset and IP lists; licences and permits; supplier and customer agreements; and the business property lease.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Determining a Fair Sale Price</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Many business vendors can feel nervous when naming a sale price. Too high, and they will deter potential buyers. Too low, and they risk undercutting their own profits. Fortunately, Kay said there exist two main methods for pricing a business: asset valuation and multiplier basis.</p>\n<p>\u201cAn asset valuation is where you add up the value of all your assets including both physical and intangible assets to set a sale price,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe multiplier basis involves multiplying your annual profit or revenue by a specific number \u2014 the \u2018multiplier\u2019 or \u201cmultiple\u2019. This valuation method is most common for growing businesses. One way to think about a multiplier of profit is that if someone buys your business on a multiplier of 3x profit, they would hope to be able to make back their investment within three years.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kay warned that both methods have their limitations, and it is important for any business vendor to think on which approach will suit their needs.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf your business is one where most of the value is in the goodwill, such as brand awareness, customer lists, reputation, an asset valuation may not really be meaningful and a multiplier method will probably be more appropriate,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen using the multiplier basis, there are also many other factors that might apply to a business.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the key ones is the industry that your business operates in.

They had created an IoT nanosatellite technology startup in Adelaide at a time when Australia\u2019s commercial space sector was practically non-existent and \u2013 in the absence of a national space agency \u2013 they were told the venture would likely fail.</strong></p>\n<p>Fast-forward to today and <a href=\"https://www.fleet.space\">Fleet</a> is in the midst of a hot streak that has helped give life to Australia\u2019s once-static space startup ecosystem. In less than 12 months, the startup has completed a\u00a0$5 million Series A capital raise, partnered with French space agency CNES, opened offices in LA and the Netherlands and seen its workforce balloon to more than 20 employees. Most recently, Fleet secured a $500,000 Future Jobs Fund grant from the South Australian Government, giving it the means to create a mission control centre in Adelaide as well as 17 ongoing jobs in IT and advanced manufacturing.</p>\n<p>According to Fleet\u2019s CEO, Flavia Tata Nardini, she and her team aren\u2019t just getting started, they have long-term plans to become a unicorn. The Italian-born entrepreneur spoke to <em>Dynamic Business</em> about the startup she co-founded with Matthew Pearson (COO) and Matthew Tetlow (ex-CTO), including the ins-and-outs of Fleet\u2019s core technology, its major wins and the influence its success has had on Australia\u2019s commercial space sector.</p>\n<p><strong>DB: What is the elevator pitch for Fleet?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nardini:</strong>\u00a0Determined to transform the future of industries from space, we\u2019re launching a world-first constellation of 100 nanosatellites to ubiquitously connect the world\u2019s IoT devices, which are predicted to number 75 billion by 2025. Once live, our network will create a digital nervous system that covers the planet, creating a world more connected than ever before.</p>\n<p>Our world is facing some huge challenges \u2013 we live in an era of exponential population growth, increasing environmental challenges and rapid resource depletion. The constellation of nanosatellites will power the next industrial revolution, giving businesses new access to data and connectivity, so that many of these issues can be solved.</p>\n<p>Using our patented IoT nanosatellite technology (i.e. the software payload within the satellites), we\u2019re able to gather data for our customers and provide them with insights necessary to operate more efficiently.\u00a0From equipping the Defence Force with instantaneous data for maritime safety exercises, to providing the digital infrastructure to create vertical fences for precision agriculture, and even monitoring tree regeneration in the Amazon rainforest \u2013\u00a0 there are endless possibilities.</p>\n<p><strong>DB: What circumstances led to the creation of Fleet?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nardini:</strong>\u00a0Due to a life-long passion for rockets and engines, I studied to become an aerospace engineer. Then, ten years ago, my career took off when I started working as a propulsion engineer for the European Space Agency (ESA) in the Netherlands. During my three years with ESA, I began exploring ways to put miniature engines into nanosatellites known as CubeSats. At that time, they were still being used for research purposes, not commercial.</p>\n<p>After meeting my husband (he\u2019s an Aussie) four years ago, I moved to Adelaide to be with him. There was only one space startup in the country (Saber Astronautics), so it was tough finding a job that truly interested me\u2026 especially without an Australian passport. It made me realise that entrepreneurship was the right path for me.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t long before I connected with fellow aerospace engineer Matthew Tetlow and serial entrepreneur Matthew Pearson (Co-founder &amp; CEO, Honcho).\u00a0Like me, both wanted to see the Australian space industry thrive. In early 2014, we co-founded LaunchBox, determined to affect real change by improving engagement with STEM and inspire school students to look to the stars for their futures. We did so by supplying a kit that enabled students to build a miniature CubeSat satellite using 3D printed components.</p>\n<p>The following year, the three of us co-founded Fleet. We saw a massive opportunity to solve some of the world\u2019s big issues from space using our patented IoT nanosatellite technology.</p>\n<p><strong>DB: What are the advantages of nanosatellites over traditional ones?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nardini:</strong>\u00a0Nanotechnology is transforming the space industry. The miniaturisation of electronics and the use of lightweight materials to build components has seen the rise of cost-efficient and lean manufactured nanosatellites. Instead of spending\u00a0billions launching very large satellites 36,000km from earth, which is a complex exercise, we will piggyback on rocket launches scheduled across the world to deploy a swarm of little satellites (roughly the size of a shoebox) into low orbit \u2013 at a fraction of the cost.\u00a0We\u2019re gearing up to launch our first two nanosatellites this year but we\u2019re in a positon to launch the entire constellation within the next three to four years.</p>\n<p><strong>DB: What sort of capital will be required to launch the constellation?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nardini:</strong>\u00a0Let me tell you, rocket science is no easy feat!\u00a0Unlike a software company, which you can bootstrap, a space company such as Fleet is very capital intensive due to infrastructure requirements, including the nanosatellites and ground stations. We couldn\u2019t survive without VCs and private investment, which is why capital raising is part of our daily job at Fleet. Securing $5m in Series A capital from Blackbird Ventures, Mike Cannon-Brookes and Silicon Valley\u2019s Horizon Ventures last year was a huge win for us. It also made us\u00a0one of the first companies in the world to raise capital for nanosatellite IoT.</p>\n<p><strong>DB: You\u2019re also the first space startup in Cannon-Brookes portfolio\u2026</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nardini:</strong>\u00a0Yes, It\u2019s very flattering! Being the co-founder of Atlassian, his name affords us a great deal of credibility and we\u2019re also benefitting from his passion, advice, encouragement and support.</p>\n<p><strong>DB: How significant is your partnership with French space agency CNES?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nardini:</strong>\u00a0When we announced our partnership with CNES, last year, it was especially significant because the Australian Government hadn\u2019t yet announced its plans to launch a national space agency. CNES is the second biggest space agency in the world after NASA but they\u2019re the first to have a program which deploys satellite in IoT.\u00a0 Having them partner wth us means we\u2019ve not only been validated by the VC community, we\u2019ve also been validated by the space community! CNES is providing us with access to not only fifty years of industry knowledge but also vital infrastructure. For instance, the agency will be using their network of ground communications antennas to track our first two nanosatellites once they launch. Our mission control centre in Adelaide will also be critical for the operational support of our nanosatellites and will ultimately safeguard the connection of our network of billions of online devices.</p>\n<p><strong>DB: What will the creation of a national space agency mean for Fleet?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nardini:</strong>\u00a0It will be a huge turning point for Australia\u2019s space industry in terms of legislative support, funding opportunities and promoting STEM education. For Fleet specifically, the agency will provide opportunities for us to apply for greater government grants, attract more world-class talent and keep Fleet\u2019s headquarters on Australian soil.</p>\n<p><strong>DB: What has been a major barrier to realising your vision for Fleet?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nardini:</strong>\u00a0It hasn\u2019t been easy creating a space startup from this side of the planet\u2026 but we\u2019re proving it can be done. If Fleet had been a Silicon Valley startup, we\u2019d be very rich; instead, we decided to create a space startup in Australia at a time when a commercial space industry didn\u2019t really exist and there wasn\u2019t even a national space agency. Maybe we were being a bit na\u00efve but Matt (Pearson) and I didn\u2019t listen to the environment\u2026 if we had, Fleet would never had succeeded. In the very beginning, we had people tell us, \u201cit will fail, there\u2019s no money\u201d. We chose to ignore them and just do it. To get to where we are, we\u2019ve had to have a great story, a customer focus, a global mindset and be very bold.</p>\n<p><strong>DB: How is the overall health of Australia\u2019s space industry today?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nardini:</strong>\u00a0In the past year, Australia has gone from a\u00a0couple of space startups to more than two sixty. So, the commercial space sector is booming. Part of the reason is that Australia offers many geographical benefits for space activities including minimal light pollution, expansive land areas to test on and highly educated workers. Also, ambitious space startups are thriving due to state government support and interest from private investors and global VCs. As one of Australia\u2019s first successful space startups, we\u2019ve helped validate the market, paving the way for others to create their own success.</p>\n<p><strong>DB: Looking ahead, what growth plans do you have for Fleet?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nardini:</strong>\u00a0This year is gearing up to be incredible one for Fleet. In addition to launching our first two nanosatellites, creating the mission control centre in Adelaide, undertaking a variety of pilot projects and working on our product pipeline, we will be launching a Series B funding round.</p>\n<p>We also have plans to build our first ground station in South Australia to support the telecommand of our first nanosatellites and the customer data collected. This ground station will be the first of many that we\u2019re looking to create around the world to support our constellation of nanosatellites.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m also really focused on showing industries address pressing issues, such as food and water wastage, with the aid of low-cost IoT nanosatellite technology. Ultimately,\u00a0we want to grow Fleet to become unicorn company. A lot of work to do but we\u2019ve got the team to do it, so we\u2019re quite positive.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/entrepreneur-profile/rocket-science-is-no-easy-feat-fleets-ceo-on-paving-the-way-for-space-startups-in-australia.html/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>InfoTrack partners with ASX to consider taking on PEXA for Australia&#8217;s e-conveyancing crown</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/news/infotrack-partners-with-asx-to-consider-taking-on-pexa-for-australias-e-conveyancing-crown.html</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/news/infotrack-partners-with-asx-to-consider-taking-on-pexa-for-australias-e-conveyancing-crown.html#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 04:22:06 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[James Harkness]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[5 technology trends to watch]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[ASX]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[conveyancing]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[ELNO]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[InfoTrack]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[PEXA]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/?p=82821</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Property Exchange Australia (PEXA), which has positioned itself as \u00a0\u2018the ASX for property settlements\u2019, is facing a significant threat to its monopoly over the market from a potential new joint venture.

On top of that, there\u2019s a bit of a Catch 22 scenario where hardware innovators require capital to develop their prototype\u2026 but investors want to see a prototype before they give them money.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82811\" style=\"width: 288px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"wp-image-82811 size-full\" src=\"http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/canva-photo-editor-575.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"278\" height=\"373\" srcset=\"http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/canva-photo-editor-575.png 278w, http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/canva-photo-editor-575-224x300.png 224w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Victor Vicario, CEO of Vektor Innovation (t/as Arc Hardware Incubator)</p></div>\n<p><strong>In-house experts, equipment</strong></p>\n<p>Vicario said Arc, which is 460 m\u00b2 facility in Fortitude Valley, addresses these difficulties for its members by providing them with flexible access to a range of cutting-edge advanced prototyping and manufacturing equipment that might otherwise be beyond their means. Resources include computer labs with pre-installed industrial design software, 3D printers (\u201cstay tuned for carbon fibre 3D printing\u201d), laser cutters, CNC machines and soldering stations as well as assembly and testing facilities.</p>\n<p>In addition, Vicario said Arc has a \u2018media lab\u2019, where members can access audio and video equipment to produce content for \u201cuse in marketing, crowdfunding campaigns or investment pitches\u201d.</p>\n<p>According to Vicario, providing members with access to in-house technical and business expertise as well as ongoing mentoring and opportunities for industry networking and investor engagement has been \u201cas important as ensuring they have the right prototyping and manufacturing resources\u201d.</p>\n<p>To cater for hardware startups at different stages of their journey \u2013 from pre-revenue ventures still finalising their core talent through to more established companies \u2013 Vicario said Arc operates a subscription-based model, with \u201caccess to prototyping and manufacturing technologies from as little as $25 per day\u201d.</p>\n<p><strong>Remote access for members</strong></p>\n<p>Leveraging a $260,000 Incubator Support grant from the Federal Government, Vicario said Arc will very shortly beginning rolling out a series of programs designed to engage the hardware startup community.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have startup weekends planned as well as industry-specific hackathons where innovators will address real-world problems,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll also introduce a pre-accelerator program to assist innovators with early-stage product development and a post-accelerator program to prepare companies for the logistical issues and regulatory requirements associated with manufacturing in large volumes.</p>\n<p>Vicario said Arc is able to accommodate between 30 and 40 startup teams due to the fact that it houses equipment that can be operated remotely.</p>\n<p>\u201cNearly all of our equipment can operate for a long period of time \u2013 ten, twenty, thirty hours or more \u2013 so we can create benefits for a lot of teams even when they\u2019re not physically present at the incubator,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can send jobs remotely and monitor when they can come into the incubator and what\u2019s equipment has been booked.

But failing a startup shouldn\u2019t be viewed so negatively by those in the business world or by others.</strong></p>\n<p>Many budding entrepreneurs who decide to commence a startup are excited about potential growth while nervous about failure, but the statistics aren\u2019t helping any fears people might have.</p>\n<p>A report from Dun &amp; Bradstreet shows that the startup failure rate is on the rise with a 42% increase in the number of startups ceasing operations.</p>\n<p>While it is challenging to make it big, people should not be ashamed for opening a startup that didn\u2019t go as planned.</p>\n<p>Many people will look at this as a bad thing, but here\u2019s why it is quite the opposite.</p>\n<p><strong>It\u2019s not failing, it\u2019s practice</strong></p>\n<p>An unsuccessful startup should be placed in the same category as practice or training. Just like you train for a marathon or study before a test, the only real way to practice running a business is to actually start one.</p>\n<p>Startups are the best way to do practice as there\u2019s a lot less on the line than buying an established business or franchise. Failing a business in its early stages is much more harmless than folding later down the track.</p>\n<p>There are less staff that will become unemployed and there is likely to be less money invested.</p>\n<p>People shouldn\u2019t think of it as investing time and money into a business that went nowhere. If you don\u2019t win a gold medal, does that make competing at the Olympics any less of a valuable experience? No, and it\u2019s the same in the startup and small business world.</p>\n<p><strong>There\u2019s still scope for a second, third and fourth chance</strong></p>\n<p>Classifying an unsuccessful startup as \u2018practice\u2019 implies that there will be another attempt at starting a business and many people that I come across are planning to do just that.</p>\n<p>This cloud really does have a silver lining and the founders of these businesses could use what they have learnt for the better.</p>\n<p>Things from the get-go could be done different, experts should be called in sooner or more market research undertaken.</p>\n<p>These are the most common things I hear when talking to former startup owners that they wish they had done.</p>\n<p><strong>Attitudes need to change</strong></p>\n<p>Many people that try to start businesses in Australia can\u2019t stand the thought of failing.</p>\n<p>Some cultures, particularly in Asia, do not accept a failed business in such a way, and international students in Australia don\u2019t want to go home and explain to their parents that their business was hardly able to take off the ground.</p>\n<p>I have worked with budding entrepreneurs in Outcome.Hub, most which are international students. One international graduate had a shot at creating an app that simplifies the process of choosing a restaurant. However, the pin was pulled early when it was discovered it was too hard of an app to monetise.</p>\n<p>While the founder feels like a disappointment and is trying to save face in front of his parents, it should be seen in a completely different light.</p>\n<p>I know that this particular graduate has learnt so much from what has been an incredibly valuable experience but many people, and even the statistics, don\u2019t see it that way.</p>\n<p>Our perceptions and attitudes towards failed businesses needs to change so that it isn\u2019t seen as a bad thing but as more of a stepping stone to startup success.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>About the author</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Gerard Holland is the co-founder of <a href=\"https://outcome.life/\">Outcome.Life</a> and Outcome-Hub and specialises in empowering international graduates through independent advice and help.

In total, Scale-Up alumni have raised US$3 billion in venture capital and had 48 exits.</p>\n<p>Citing \u201cenormous competition\u201d from different countries to secure Microsoft Scale-Up, Small Business Minister John Barilaro said it would not have been possible to attract an accelerator program of Scale-Up\u2019s calibre without the NSW Government\u2019s investment in the Sydney Startup Hub.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Microsoft Australia Managing Director Steven Worrall said his company\u2019s aim, in taking up residence at the Sydney Startup Hub, was to \u201cbe the glue that connects the start-up ecosystem in Australia\u201d.</p>\n<p>In addition to running the Scale-Up program from the Sydney Startup Hub, Microsoft has plans to use the facility to host events, including hackathons, investor pitches and CEO sessions.</p>\n<p>Muru-D co-founder and former Fishburners CEO Annie Parker was recently appointed to lead Microsoft\u2019s startup programs globally, including Microsoft Scale-Up.\u00a0The tech company is currently in the process of recruiting a Managing Director to lead the Sydney ScaleUp program and expects to run its first four-month program before the end of 2018.</p>\n<p>Alex\u00a0Gruszka, COO of StartupAUS \u2013 the peak body for Australian startups \u2013 described the Sydney Startup Hub as a \u201cstriking example of what can be achieved in a short time with an action-focused approach\u201d.</p>\n<p>He added, \u201cIn 2016, StartupAUS publicly called for investment into innovation precincts as a key component of a thriving tech sector. Within two years, Jobs for NSW, with the support of the startup ecosystem, have created the largest startup hub in the southern hemisphere. It is a fantastic achievement that sets a high bar for the ambitions of Australia more broadly</p>\n<p>Bede Moore, the director of entrepreneur-led advocacy agency TechSydney described Microsoft\u2019s tenancy as \u201ca huge coup for Sydney and Australia\u201d, adding that the Scale-Up program will &#8220;help us take our startup development to the next level we need to compete globally.</p>\n<p>Although he described the official opening of the Sydney Startup Hub as a \u201cmilestone moment for Sydney\u2019s startup economy\u201d, Moore noted that the hub is \u201cnot far from capacity\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhile this is evidence of the hub\u2019s success, we need to now start looking beyond the end of the five-year lease \u2013 a timeframe in which many of our fledgling startup brands will have reached scale-up stage,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cRather than allowing these valuable high-growth technology\u00a0businesses to disperse and dilute the impact of their economic offering, the evidence from high performance innovation communities worldwide points to the need for us to provide them with a more permanent home in a central location.&#8221;</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/featured/huge-coup-for-sydney-35m-startup-hub-to-host-exclusive-microsoft-accelerator-program.html/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Let\u2019s Talk\u2026 Starting a business</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/featured/lets-talk-starting-a-business.html</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/featured/lets-talk-starting-a-business.html#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2018 21:08:40 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[James Harkness]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Expert]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Featured]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Let's Talk Business]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[BlueChilli]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[DCC Jobs]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Enabled Employment]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Entrepreneur]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Food St]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[founder]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[GO1.com]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Heads Over Heels]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Jamie Pride]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[King Kong]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Let's Talk]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Meerkats Creative Business Solutions]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Nod]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[OpenLearning]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Otlet]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Quizling]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[SBE Australia]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Soho]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Start-Up]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Techstars Adelaide]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tinybeans]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Visual Domain]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/?p=82767</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[\u201cSome first-time startup founders buy into the myth that they will have more time, more freedom and more money\u2026 it couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\u201d For our\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s Talk\u2026\u201d\u00a0feature, this week, we asked 18 thought leaders to discuss the personal sacrifices that first-time founders generally overlook when they\u2019re bitten by the startup bug.

An oft-overlooked trade-off, according to most commentators, is TIME \u2013 for friends and family. For hobbies. For walking the dog. For grocery shopping. For non-work thoughts. For one\u2019s self. Indeed, many stressed the importance of first-time founders striking a balance between work and non-work life in order to bring their best to both. Read on for further insights from this week\u2019s lineup\u2026</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Jessica May, CEO, Enabled Employment &amp; Portfolio CEO, Heads Over Heels:</strong> \u201cFirst-time founders often don\u2019t know about the rollercoaster that is running a startup. The risks are higher, the personal stress levels may impact on your life in unexpected ways, and if you\u2019re not aware of the financial and investment process you may be so discouraged at some points you\u2019ll give up. You need to be incredibly determined to make your idea work and prepared to sacrifice all your previous beliefs about what you think you know about running a business.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Sabri Suby, Founder, King Kong:</strong> \u201cMost business owners underestimate how much time will be taken away from their loved ones when they start a business. They quit their 40-hour work weeks and end up working 100-hour weeks. And that&#8217;s time they don&#8217;t get to spend with their kids, their partner and their friends. If your loved ones share the same goals as you for the business and want to be part of the journey, then that certainly helps. But it is still the most difficult part of the startup phase.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Dion Oxley, CEO, Quizling &amp; Portfolio CEO, Heads Over Heels:</strong> \u201cBalance is something first-time founder can overlook. Quizling would take up every second if I let it\u2026 but I would be poorer for it. It took some hard lessons for me to realise the importance of balance. I need to spend time with family, friends and doing things I enjoy. Some of those I neglected and lost \u2013 I simply didn\u2019t take enough time for myself and my relationships! I now make sure I have time with friends, go running regularly, find time to just enjoy telly and one day soon I will go to bed before midnight!\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Jonathan Lui, Founder, Soho: </strong>\u201cOne of the first things founders think of when starting a business is the financial sacrifice. This is a change that often goes hand in hand with startups, but what they may overlook is the time sacrifice, or time commitment required to make a startup successful.</p>\n<p>Once you start a business, the more successful start-ups are driven by founders who are\u00a0<em>obsessed</em>\u00a0with the business and are thinking about it 24/7, from the moment they wake up to the moment they go to sleep. Time actually becomes a limiting factor as they\u2019ll often feel like they need more hours in the day to do what they need to do and this is often overlooked before starting a business.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis can obviously roll on to other aspects of a founder\u2019s life such as their relationships with their partners, family and friends, which may end up taking a back seat for a period until things really start taking off. This is why it\u2019s important to have an open understanding in personal relationships to ensure the expectations are set that time may be scarce.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Renece Brewster, CEO, Visual Domain and Portfolio CEO, Heads Over Heels: </strong>\u201cYou don&#8217;t really realise the psychological isolation that comes with starting a business and trying to find the balance between life and work. A lot of the time family and friends don&#8217;t understand some of the sacrifices we make so it&#8217;s important to surround yourself with a network that understand the challenges you are going through.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie Pride, serial entrepreneur, VC &amp; author (\u2018Unicorn Tears\u2019): </strong>\u201cBeing a founder often means you put yourself last. Your customers come first. Your product comes first. Your team comes first. Your investors come first. The result is that founders are often numbing out, burning out or checking out. Some first-time founders buy into the myth that they will have more time, more freedom and more money\u2026 it couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. What many founders give up is their physical, mental and emotional health \u2013 and the stress that a startup places on their relationships. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Founders need to prioritise their own welfare. In order to lead effectively they need to take better care of themselves so they can go the distance.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Anonymous aka \u201cHappily married mother of two (for the moment) content kids\u201d, BlueChilli:</strong> \u201cMost first-time founders are aware of the big personal sacrifices that accompany the early days of building your startup. Conversations with your nearest and dearest about shouldering more responsibility while you risk income and family time to pursue your dreams are expected (and highly recommended). It\u2019s so easy to let the smaller things go, and you know what, you don\u2019t have to.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat lesson was brought home not too long ago when, juggling a phone call, school drop off and reminding my two small monkeys to do something. I waved them into the school gates only for the little one to turn around to say, \u201cI\u2019m WAITING for my hug!\u201d and then disappear. I missed out on that hug.</p>\n<p>\u201cI tell myself now, I couldn\u2019t find 60 seconds to kiss my kids goodbye???</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, while you\u2019re running on adrenaline, fuelled by your passion for &lt;insert your business vision here&gt; don\u2019t forget the one minute memories that connect you with the present and the people you love. Love isn\u2019t a zero sum game, pursing something you love doesn\u2019t mean taking it away from the people you love.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Terry Gold, Managing Director, Techstars Adelaide:</strong> \u201cNothing can quite prepare first-time founders for the loneliness they are about to face. At least, at the beginning of their entrepreneurial journey. The long hours, the rapidly diminishing runway, hiring issues are all expected challenges. But the burden of loneliness\u2026 many cannot foresee it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is an intense pressure to always be \u2018up\u2019 and optimistic, but if you can never express the fears and worries to others then it can lead to an isolation that can even lead to depression. Not only is that bad for the founder but it is also bad for the business, and as a startup community we have to help prevent that isolation.</p>\n<p>\u201cMost tech entrepreneurs come from an engineering background and they have the tendency to just throw themselves into creating a product, rather than face the fact they know so little about how to build the actual business. They don\u2019t want to expose how little they know or admit they are struggling.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe answer to this dilemma is to get involved with other founders in the startup community that can act as a support system of other like-minded, first-time founders who are also going through the same things.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Valeria Ignatieva, Co-founder, DCC Jobs: \u201c</strong>Many first-time founders play the side hustle game to transition from a full-time salary to having a business that\u2019s making some money, but perhaps underestimate the toll this will have on their personal life. If you\u2019re working full-time that means working nights, weekends and public holidays on your new venture. This leaves little time for family, friends any personal hobbies.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you start a business, you have to also be prepared to make a financial sacrifice while you build up your customer base, but if you have chosen something you are truly passionate about, it will not be as hard as it seems. For myself and DCC cofounder Gemma Lloyd, being able to improve Australian workplaces and help women find rewarding careers with employers who value them, has been worth every struggle we have faced over the past 3 years!\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Mike Edmonds, Founder, Meerkats Creative Business Solutions &amp; author (\u2018Truth. Growth. Repeat.\u2019): </strong>\u201cFirst-time founders expect to sacrifice time with family, financial security, etc. But I was surprised to learn how often I needed to sacrifice my ego. In other words, give up an opportunity to be seen as a winner in order to stay on track with my true purpose. A company approached my agency in our first months with a $1m advertising account but were clearly a wrong fit for our philosophy. As much as I desperately wanted that PR headline to prove to everyone that an ethical ad agency was not a crazy idea, I had to resist. It was hard\u2026 but I\u2019ve never regretted it.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Lorraine Gnanadickam, Founder &amp; CEO, Food St &amp; SBE Australia E3 graduate:</strong> \u201cTime is already the most valuable commodity in business but when you become a founder it becomes indescribably scarce.\u00a0For me, the first thing that I sacrificed was \u2018me-time\u2019, I was always working against the clock to get as much done as quickly as I could. Because I was a new founder as well as a parent, a spouse and a friend, there was always something more important than myself demanding my time\u2026 unfortunately, this has meant weight gain and low energy. SO, I\u2019ve been spending this year taking back \u2018me-time\u2019 \u2013 \u00a0I am going to yoga, I am meditating and I am finding some time to just be with my kids. I think \u2018me time\u2019 is often overlooked because founding a company is so demanding and we feel guilty about taking that time out to do something \u2018selfish\u2019. But if we\u2019re not well, not feeling good, then we\u2019re not functioning at our best either.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Mark Fletcher, CEO, Cohort Go:</strong> \u201cThe entrepreneurial lifestyle comes with challenges and trade-offs. While many founders expect the long hours, the struggle of keeping the business afloat, hiring and other resources issues, many overlook the reality that health and fitness often fall by the wayside. Building a business and spending a lot of time working at a computer can make it easy to neglect your health.</p>\n<p>\u201cFounders are ready to give it their all, prioritising their company over everything else. However, sacrificing fitness and health can significantly impact how you run and build your business.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaking time for some R&amp;R is vital to put you in the right frame of mind to build your company, to be as productive and efficient as possible and manage stress levels. It doesn\u2019t have to be a month-long holiday in the Bahamas. It can be as simple as hitting the gym twice a week, making time for friends or spending quality time with your family.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren Meyer, Co-founder, Otlet:</strong> \u201cWhen starting a business, everyone focuses on sacrificing time and money, often both personal and professional. As people give up nights and weekends with friends and family, strain relationships and put aside better paying jobs, it becomes a calculable sacrifice for the good of their newly founded business.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe knew that starting Otlet would be a huge time and financial strain, but I didn\u2019t realise it would also devour all available \u2018brain time\u2019. It\u2019s the incalculable time you spend at the grocery store, walking the dog, working at your other 9-to-5 job. When your brain is completely absorbed running through your new business there\u2019s little time for anything else.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlthough ready to dedicate long hours\u00a0<em>actively\u00a0</em>working on Otlet, we didn\u2019t realise we had also signed over spare thoughts and emotional energy.\u00a0 It is that \u2018brain time\u2019 that you rely on to compartmentalize your normal day that is now spent ticking over UX design, marketing, budget, etc., despite telling your partner you were \u2018done working for the day\u2019. It is an incalculable sacrifice, but not an insignificant one.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Adam Brimo, CEO, OpenLearning</strong>: \u201cI think most entrepreneurs are visionaries. When you are a first-time founder, you don\u2019t realise how much work is involved and how committed you have to be to make that vision a success.\u00a0One of the lessons I learnt early on was that you have to be OK with being \u2018on-call\u2019 all the time. Not just for your clients, but for your\u00a0staff\u00a0members too.\u00a0You need to be good at juggling and wearing many hats because you are not just building a\u00a0business, you also need to be a leader, a problem solver and customer service provider.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Joel Robbie, Co-founder &amp; CEO, Nod:</strong> \u201cOn the surface level, you&#8217;re sacrificing time to eat, sleep, and spend time with family. On a deeper level, a lack of mental downtime can become pretty draining over time. As a founder you (rightly) live and breathe your company. Almost every human interaction you have almost unavoidably ends up being related to work. This is really a double-edged sword that becomes both inspirational and challenging. Scheduling time for music, meditation and family provides brief respite, allowing first-time founders like me to recharge my batteries and continue to focus on doing what I love to do, which is building a great company with amazing people.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Eddie Gellar, Co-founder &amp; CEO, Tinybeans:\u00a0\u201c</strong>Founders are all about solving a problem and will go to great lengths to do so. They\u2019re passionate, often stubborn to the challenges and have a \u201cMUST WIN\u201d attitude around building a great company.\u00a0The realities of sacrifices are always overlooked whether they\u2019re first time or not. Founders believe they\u2019ll be successful and based on that, success arrives in due course. Of course, there are sacrifices along the way, like less time with family because you\u2019re working so hard\u2026 but founders believe that if they succeed, then they will have all the time in the world later. If its finance related, it\u2019s the same thing and on it goes.\u00a0I don\u2019t believe that there is any one sacrifice that is more or less relevant to a founder. Founders are determined to be successful and making sacrifices is part of the course of being a great founder. History has proven that.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Vu Tran, Co-founder &amp; Head of Growth, GO1.com:</strong> \u201cSacrifices made by first-time founders in starting and growing a business can be immense and, in many cases, immeasurable. As founders, we are often incredibly passionate about what we do with a firm belief in the immense potential our idea or business can fulfil. It is often this optimism, passion and in some cases substantial personal sacrifice that has accompanied countless entrepreneurial success stories.</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe that commitment rather than sacrifice is the common ingredient and defining feature between those with a great idea and those who turn great ideas into great companies. Indeed, sacrifice may not always be required to be successful, but commitment is.</p>\n<p>\u201cFounders who are passionate about their business is a must, but passion without commitment is often a short-lived fling. Commitment is a marriage. Commitment results in founders who will do what it takes to succeed, who will roll with punches and problem solve or pivot to create success.</p>\n<p>\u201cA first-time founder must have both feet in. Having one foot in and one foot out just won\u2019t cut it.\u201d</p>\n<div><b>Hugh Morrow, Co-founder &amp; CEO, \u00a0SuperEd:\u00a0 \u201c</b>There&#8217;s a lot of time and effort that first-time founders put into a start-up, and often it&#8217;s important personal time outside of regular hours that they&#8217;re investing to help build the business from the ground up. One point that is often overlooked is the readjustment that first-time founders need to make. A key aspect of being a first-time founder is having the courage to be humble, sacrifice your ego and learn something deeper about yourself.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\u201cFor startups like SuperEd, it&#8217;s often hard to come to terms with the fact that you are no longer operating under the mantle of the industry and corporate structures with years of expertise under your belt. Instead, you&#8217;re being brave and having to take strides forward to push yourself, learn new things on your own and that carves out a whole part of the self-development aspect of the journey that comes with the territory of being a first-time founder. You realise that there&#8217;s a lot to this process of forming a start-up and a common fear that first-time founders have is being concerned that you&#8217;re too slow, because there&#8217;s always new challengers and entrants coming in who are quicker and more nimble. This is why it&#8217;s so critical for first-time founders to a step back and see the bigger picture, be humble, learn quickly, sacrifice your ego and be ready to adapt.\u201d</div>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>About \u201cLet\u2019s Talk\u2026\u201d</strong></p>\n<p><em>\u201cLet\u2019s Talk\u2026\u201d is an exciting weekly initiative that provides entrepreneurs and industry experts with a forum to share rapid-fire views on a range of issues that matter to start-ups and SMEs.

For instance, if they have entered into a contract and financially committed to a particular course of action only to discover the terms and conditions weren\u2019t what the bank led them to believe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Carnell said the Royal Commission was also a forum for small businesses to report instances where, to their detriment, a bank changed the terms and conditions of a contract during the period of the loan.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor example, a bank might revalue an asset and \u2013 based on the revised valuation \u2013 either require the business to suddenly make significantly higher repayments or require repayment of the loan within a very short time frame, say two weeks,\u201d she explained.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen cases where a business made their loan payments on time only to have their loan moved into default and the interest rate doubled.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Carnell said the Royal Commission should also be made aware of instances where small businesses were &#8220;assured a loan would be given or rolled over only for the bank to change its mind at the last minute, perhaps even when they arrived to sign the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p>She advised small businesses not to miss out on an opportunity to \u201ctell their story\u201d to an independent entity.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, it would be a very bad mistake for a small business to take a bank to court,\u201d she said. \u201cBanks have long timelines and very deep pockets whereas small businesses don\u2019t. If you have any money when you take a bank to court, you won\u2019t for very long. That\u2019s why it\u2019s very important for businesses to put forward their case to the Royal Commission and highlight the consequences of banks using their power unfairly.\u201d</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/news/small-businesses-urged-to-air-grievances-with-the-royal-commission-into-the-banking-sector.html/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Do you apply the Veil of Ignorance in business?</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/expert/do-you-apply-the-veil-of-ignorance-in-business.html</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/expert/do-you-apply-the-veil-of-ignorance-in-business.html#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2018 02:34:33 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Stephen Barnes]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Expert]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[boardroom]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Byronvale Advisors]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[decision-making]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Leadership]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[political theory]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Rawls]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Stephen Barnes]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Veil of Ignorance]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/?p=82713</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Broadly speaking, leaderships teams bring to the decision-making table not only a collection of business skills but also a unique set of personal views, informed by each member\u2019s circumstances, including the tribes they belong to.\u00a0 Of course, each member has a range of legal and fiduciary duties to the business.

This includes the duty to act in its best interests and the duty exercise powers for proper purpose.</p>\n<p>In this context, it\u2019s possible that someone\u2019s personal views might put them in conflict with their duties to their company. This is where a decision-making method, known as the &#8216;Veil of Ignorance&#8217;, could prove useful.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the Veil of Ignorance method?</strong></p>\n<p>In\u00a0the 1970s,\u00a0American philosopher John Rawls developed what is now known as the Veil of Ignorance to help politicians make objective moral decisions by eliminating biases from the decision-making processes.</p>\n<p>The method requires people with the power to affect the distribution of benefits (rights, positions and resources) in society to imagine they know nothing about their own particular talents, abilities, tastes, class position or social status. In applying this Veil of Ignorance, a person is prevented from letting their personal considerations impede the just distribution of benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>How does the Veil of Ignorance work?</strong></p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take the example of a society in which 50% of the population\u00a0lives\u00a0below the poverty line. By applying the Veil of Ignorance, the decision-maker adopts the mindset that he or she \u2013 regardless of their real-life circumstances \u2013 is equally likely to be living below the poverty line as to not be. The idea is that the decision maker is putting themselves in a position to make decisions free of self-interest or class bias.</p>\n<p><strong>How could it work\u00a0in a business context</strong>?</p>\n<p>Recently, marriage equality has been a very topical issue in Australia, with several organisations coming out in support of it as well as those that have opposed it. This made me wonder whether any leadership teams, in determining their organisation\u2019s position on marriage equality, applied the Veil of Ignorance. If they had, this is the sort of question they might have asked themselves idividually and as a collective: \u201cRemoving my sexuality, religious beliefs, personal interests and group-interests from the equation, If I did not know whether my child, relative, friend or a staff member was straight or gay, would I support marriage equality?\u201d</p>\n<p>Easy to say but hard to implement, the Veil of Ignorance is a concept worth considering especially in situations where the decisions being considered are highly emotive or have personal ramifications.\u00a0 So, at your next leadership meeting when there is a highly emotive issue, explain the Veil of Ignorance to your team and, as a collective, try applying it. You might just find it reduces the tension as individuals can rationalise their decision better and feel more comfortable with their own decision and the decision of the collective, unified leadership group.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>About the\u00a0author</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Stephen Barnes is the principal of management consultancy Byronvale Advisors.\u00a0 He has over 20 years advising clients from new business start-ups to publicly listed companies and across a wide array of industries.\u00a0 He prides himself on quickly understanding the client\u2019s business and issues, and synthesising problems to develop pragmatic solutions.\u00a0 He is also the author of \u2018Run Your Business Better\u2019.\u00a0 To find out how Stephen can help you run your business better visit</em><em>\u00a0</em><em><a href=\"http://www.byronvaleadvisors.com\">www.byronvaleadvisors.com</a>.</em></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/expert/do-you-apply-the-veil-of-ignorance-in-business.html/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Cryptocurrencies: welcome to the investment market&#8217;s new &#8216;Wild West&#8217; where anything goes</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/featured/cryptocurrencies-welcome-to-the-investment-markets-new-wild-west-where-anything-goes.html</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/featured/cryptocurrencies-welcome-to-the-investment-markets-new-wild-west-where-anything-goes.html#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2018 01:59:05 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Darren Sommers]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Expert]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Featured]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[BetOnSports]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[crypto funds]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[cryptocurrencies]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[cryptocurrency]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Darren Sommers]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[ICOs]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[initial coin offering]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Investment]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Investor]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[KHQ lawyers]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Legal]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[regulation]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/?p=82731</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Cryptocurrencies, and specifically digital currency offerings, have literally become the modern, investment market equivalent of the Wild West.

It\u2019s almost lawless territory and you need to keep your wits about you to survive.</p>\n<p>This goes for both those offering currency and those investors buying it. As if to highlight the current high-risk high-stakes nature of the crypto world, almost US$660 million in digital coins were stolen during a recent hack of a <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-28/coincheck-worlds-biggest-cryptocurrency-hack/9368056\">Japanese crypto exchange</a>. It\u2019s the equivalent of an old-fashioned bank hold-up in the crypto world. Anything goes.</p>\n<p>The frenzy around digital currency has a lot to do with a lack of regulation. Many coin issuers, and too many investors, are seeing it as an incentive to get in quickly. Many are now panicking that regulation will end the party \u2013 however, my view is that regulation should be embraced. It\u2019ll create a more even playing field for all parties. And here\u2019s why.</p>\n<p>The number of global ICOs increased from 46 in 2016 to more than 200 in 2017, with over $US3 billion raised, demonstrating that the appetite is there. There is money to be made \u2013 but an age-old rule applies \u2013 short cuts are rarely a path to success.</p>\n<p>There are two clear sides to the crypto argument \u2013 the optimists say &#8216;run in and take your chances as this is the future of investing&#8217;. \u00a0Old school fund managers &#8216;say stay away&#8217; with some likening investing in digital currency with a trip to a casino.</p>\n<p>Currently, a lack of industry regulation in almost all jurisdictions makes compliance a tricky path to navigate. Couple that with a remarkably brazen, gung-ho attitude from a lot of traders and it\u2019s only a matter of time before someone gets in big trouble. And no doubt the authorities won\u2019t hesitate in making an example out of whomever that may be.</p>\n<p>Both France, Germany and Spain recently pledged to (at least attempt) <a href=\"http://www.bestforexclub24.com/2018/01/cryptocurrency-paris-and-berlin-want-to.html?m=1\">to regulate Bitcoin</a>, and other digital currencies, while fund managers around the world are steering well clear. \u00a0<a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/914669/China-Lloyds-bank-ban-cryptocurrency-why-cryptocurrency-is-falling-today\">China recently banned local cryptocurrency exchanges but is also restricting access to foreign exchanges</a>.\u00a0 However, one man\u2019s restriction is another\u2019s opportunity \u2013 bans by regulators are now helping the birth of crypto funds \u2013 that is diligently run investment funds whose primary investment asset is crypto.</p>\n<p>This provides hope that a sense of discipline and structure will now emerge in the sector.</p>\n<p>Like with gold rushes in the Wild West, it\u2019s the human-driven emotion, the sheer excitement and adrenalin rush that is in part fuelling the interest and indeed the value of digital currencies. At least gold had a clear tangible value however. The same cannot be said for cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>Some issuers will apportion a value to their coins, which may not be monetary \u2013 it might be a voucher for a right to a good or a service that the issuer can offer. Issuers need to ensure they are making the right disclosure, and it goes without saying, seek the right legal advice.</p>\n<p>For those creating and trading in digital currency, being aware of legal risks and the different rules that apply in different jurisdictions is critical.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are trading digital currency in Australia, and you are selling coins to, say, American investors, which laws do you need to comply with? What if you are an Australian company undertaking an ICO in Singapore? What happens if you offer those tokens to investors in Europe? Which jurisdictions\u2019 laws do you need to comply with? The answer \u2013 probably all of them.</p>\n<p>The lack of regulation can breed arrogance from businesses issuing ICOs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m located in Australia and I don\u2019t need to comply with US law!\u201d is a worryingly common attitude.</p>\n<p>But consider the cautionary tale of David Carruthers, the CEO of the UK based <em>BetOnSports</em> gaming site.</p>\n<p>In the early 2000s the US banned online gaming services to US citizens.\u00a0 Many businesses started offering online gaming to US citizens from overseas servers, assuming that the US had no jurisdiction over their activities.\u00a0 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/18/technology/18gamble.html\">Carruthers learnt the hard way when he was arrested during a stopover in Dallas. </a>\u00a0If it can happen in the gaming space 10 years ago, it will happen with crypto.</p>\n<p>For investors, the risks are many. The mad rush to \u201cget in\u201d the crypto wave has become intoxicating for some but the that should never cloud judgement when it comes to understanding exactly what you are buying.</p>\n<p>A mere few of the risks include a lack of legal protection and exposure, inability to participate in later capital raising rounds in the case of an ICO, coins that are worth nothing, a complete plummet in the value of the asset when the market has a panic attack, and of course the possibility that your crypto-exchange could be hacked. \u00a0The very simple message is that a lack of regulation should be a warning, not an incentive.</p>\n<p>And for the issuers \u2013 be compliant. Seek the right advice. Otherwise a knock at the door may not be too far away.</p>\n<p>Then, once law comes to crypto-town, you may just have whole new asset class to play with, with a dramatically reduced level of risk, but still enjoy those highly intoxicating returns.</p>\n<p><strong>About the author</strong></p>\n<p><em>Darren Sommers is a Principal Solicitor at Melbourne\u2019s KHQ Lawyers.

For one thing, it will give you greater credibility with your peers and potential clients, investors, and partners. It will also provide you with some good networking possibilities. The most important benefit, however, is what you can learn. An MBA isn&#8217;t a degree you get just for the letters after your name \u2013 it is a program of study that can turn you into a more well-rounded business person. You&#8217;ll get a chance to fill in any gaps in your knowledge about areas of business you have had to learn as an entrepreneur, for instance, marketing, HR or budget management, and learn how to apply what you learn to real-world scenarios.</strong></p>\n<p>Doing an MBA if you <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/mba-admissions-strictly-business/articles/2016-08-26/3-reasons-future-entrepreneurs-need-an-mba-and-1-exception\">want to become an entrepreneur </a>or are planning to launch a new startup in the future is, then, a great idea. However, is it still a good idea if you are already in business? Can you balance managing your company with studying?</p>\n<p><strong>Choose An Online MBA You Can Do Part Tim</strong>e</p>\n<p>If you are to get an MBA while running an existing business, the only way this can really be manageable (unless your business is either very small or is the kind of business that doesn&#8217;t require too much day to day hands-on management \u2013 such as some blog-type businesses) is to choose an online MBA. Some great universities offer this, such as <a href=\"http://onlinemba.wsu.edu/mba/\">Washington State University</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits of Online Study For Business Owners</strong></p>\n<p>It is kind of obvious why you&#8217;d only want to study part-time if you are spending most of your day running a business, but there are further advantages to doing your MBA with someone like Washington State University Online. For one thing, you won&#8217;t be wasting any time commuting to your campus, and for another, you don&#8217;t have to worry about the timing of your lectures interfering with your business. With WSU online, your materials are all accessible online, so you can choose where and when you watch lectures, talk to tutors, and study.</p>\n<p><strong>Is It The Right Time?</strong></p>\n<p>Even with part-time online degree courses, you still may find it hard to study for your MBA and run your business if your business is in a heavy activity phase. It may be best to wait until after a major expansion, for instance. Of course, you may not know what will come up in your business during the time you are studying, but choose a fairly stable period to start so you can at least get used to studying during a time when nothing too unusual is requiring your attention. You will then need to be flexible \u2013 you can slow down your study rate if your business needs you more at any time, as long as you resolve to get straight back into it when things are more settled.</p>\n<p>With some smart planning and the right type of degree course, it is not only possible but highly advantageous to start your MBA, even if you are already running your business.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/small-business-resources/education-and-training/is-it-a-good-idea-to-do-a-part-time-mba-while-running-your-business.html/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>3 ways politics impact business</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/industry/industry-human-resources/3-ways-politics-impact-business.html</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/industry/industry-human-resources/3-ways-politics-impact-business.html#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2018 00:30:40 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Guest Author]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Industry HR]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[George Washington University]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[politics in business]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/?p=82725</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[You may not personally want to be involved in modern politics but if you want to run a business you have to be aware how the laws of the land can affect your bottom line.

Tax laws, business treaties, tariffs, and commerce in general is impacted by politics. Graduates of <a href=\"http://politicalmanagementmasters.online.gwu.edu/\">George Washington University online</a> have insights into politics and the government that the average business professional is not exposed to. Having a degree in political management can be just as valuable as being an MBA holder. Check out the three main ways that politics and business go hand in hand.</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Politics and Business Taxes</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Individuals and businesses that have higher yearly earnings are typically taxed at a higher rate. Different political parties might campaign on a platform with promises of lowering taxes for big businesses, while the opposing party might be vying for middle-class voters. As a business owner, you need to discern the rhetoric and look at <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/28/young-entrepreneurs-wary-of-mixing-politics-and-business-in-trump-era.html\">political</a> track records. Remember that businesses have to pay state taxes, federal taxes, and sometimes local taxes if they are located in a city like New York. A small reduction in federal business taxes can be really good for a company while a major increase might lead to a business\u2019 ultimate downfall.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong> Employee Protections and Coverage</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Before Obamacare passed, business owners had a lot more freedom about the kind of healthcare coverage they were required to provide to full-time workers. States can individually vote to increase minimum wage, forcing business owners to pay workers higher wages for performing the same duties. All of these things have to do with politics. If you are expecting your business to do well in the coming years you have to know what changes the government can take, including various bills and laws that are being lobbied for.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong> International Business Impact</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Business is not done in a bubble. Sure, your company may be locally based and have mostly customers who live within the region, but most company owners dream of eventually having a global impact. When major elections take place and political atmospheres change, dealing with other business professionals can be enhanced or hampered. For example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/22/business-leaders-push-for-new-campaign-to-reverse-brexit\">the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union</a> has caused UK business owners to look at new ways to do business as the economy was negatively impacted. This is why major businesses usually back the specific political candidates that they believe have their best interests. If you have a degree from George Washington University, you will be able to better predict which candidates will be elected as well as what changes to anticipate.</p>\n<p>Business and politics are incredibly connected. Some business owners become influential and well known enough to go into politics, like Donald Trump. Sometimes the business world and politics collide when it comes to efforts to create more jobs and to stimulate the economy. Politicians can also go up against big business when companies are accused of polluting the environment or working against the interests of citizens. Know what is going on in politics if you want your business to keep running like a well-oiled machine.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/industry/industry-human-resources/3-ways-politics-impact-business.html/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>3

readers</p></div>\n<p><strong>Originally, you may have thought that dedicating an enormous number of hours in collegiate classrooms in the hopes of completing your business or finance degree would open up endless opportunities with no need for further re-education.\u00a0 Investing in yourself in this way would not only provide a nice diploma to hang on the wall but a committed career and your life in perfect order.\u00a0 You are set for life now&#8230;or so you think?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, hate to break this to you, but that mindset is a thing of the past.\u00a0 Learning can be fun, but whether you are early on in your professional financial skills or becoming a more mature expert, you must keep on top of new developments in the global trade industry so as to continue being considered the \u201cgo-to\u201d individual on such.\u00a0 The benefit of today\u2019s age is that we have online digital classes that can help you continue your education with convenience.\u00a0 Here are a couple of pluses for this realm of continued learning for those seeking a finance degree.</p>\n<p><strong>Being in Control</strong></p>\n<p>Isn\u2019t this a feeling that\u2019s rate on our days on the job?\u00a0 Well, when it comes to continuous learning, online finance courses provide a degree of control no traditional model can.\u00a0 Time is hard for us to set aside for MSF education, especially when we are already in our careers.\u00a0 The good thing about courses online from institutes such as Northeastern University is that you can fit them in when you are able to.</p>\n<p>Also, with <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-snyder/the-benefits-of-online-le_b_2573991.html\">online continuing education</a>, you can be much more selective of what specific courses you wish to take.\u00a0 Online programs can be chosen to gain specific leadership skills and expertise, such as studies toward a master of finance accredited degree.\u00a0 Not only do these options provide opportunities to keep pace with trade industry changes, but you can also gain ground in becoming an expert in financial matters as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Network Connections</strong></p>\n<p>Many online educational programs have a wide array of community forums and networking possibilities for participants.\u00a0 This can be an easily overlooked benefit, as you never know when that next LinkedIn connection can <a href=\"https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/5-tips-to-build-and-grow-your-linkedin-network/\">land you a connection</a> to someone in finance and trade you would not have thought of.\u00a0 Even with this opportunity being overlooked, being able to partner up with classmates and talk online about coursework is a great way to get into projects and assignments, as well as create relationships with fellow peers in the adaptable industry.</p>\n<p><strong>Personalized Guidance</strong></p>\n<p>Another underutilized benefit of continuing education online is the more personal approach of many professors and teachers with their students.\u00a0 When sitting in traditional settings of campus classes that frequently have hundreds of students attending, the last person to be able to get a question answered might be you until you show up to office hours.\u00a0 With online education, it is much more direct.\u00a0 Typically, instructors answer over e-mail or even have dedicated chat times where you speak with them directly about your learning material. For professionals working in demanding positions overseeing credit, analysis, and other financial matters, having an instructor who is aware of industry trends who can help you gain the most out of your master of finance can help you significantly in increasing your knowledge over financial trade areas where you feel your familiarity is lacking.</p>\n<p>These are just a small number of the less frequently thought of gains from taking your continued learning online.\u00a0 For those interested in getting further in their financial careers, <a href=\"https://onlinebusiness.northeastern.edu/neu-msf/\">consider the Northeastern University Online</a> MSF program for options that meet your needs.</p>\n<p>Although many online courses exist, making sure you find a reputable, affordable, and quality program is very important to ensure you have the best experience and that you get the knowledge and skills you are after.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/small-business-resources/education-and-training/3-credits-to-online-continuing-finance-education.html/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>4 things to think about if you want to be a project manager</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/small-business-resources/education-and-training/4-things-to-think-about-if-you-want-to-be-a-project-manager.html</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/small-business-resources/education-and-training/4-things-to-think-about-if-you-want-to-be-a-project-manager.html#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2018 00:07:32 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Guest Author]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Construction | Engineering]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Education | Training]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Earned Value Management Systems]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[project management courses]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/?p=82719</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Whether you are training to become a project manager, thinking about it, or are already one, there are certain skills and values that you should have to be the best project manager you can be.

Completing a masters in project management from Brandeis University can help you build on some of these skills and ideas, so here are the main ones to think about if you want to be at the top of your project management game.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Communication is Key</strong></p>\n<p>When taking on the role of project manager, the ability to get on with your colleagues at every level is vital to doing a good job and keeping good staff morale. You will learn what people prefer. Some team members may prefer to get straight down to business and others may like to make it a bit more personal and talk about family life too. Understanding your team&#8217;s needs and providing the right level of communication and detail will ensure you have a great project management team.</p>\n<p><strong>Get to Grips with Earned Value Management Systems (EVMS)</strong></p>\n<p>Being a project manager means reporting back to your project sponsors with schedule updates and whether you are still within budget. Although you may have a rough idea, this may not be enough for your sponsors. Using and being able to understand an <a href=\"https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/earned-value-management-explained.php\">EVMS</a> and explain what the data means to others will ensure you can give exact details, looking more professional and gaining credibility with team members and sponsors alike.</p>\n<p><strong>Hold Regular Team Meetings</strong></p>\n<p>The best way to know where everyone is at and ensure your project is a success is to hold regular team meetings. This shows your enthusiasm for the project and can boost staff morale. Team meetings can be great for setting deadlines and updating stakeholders and they only need to take a couple of minutes out of your day. The best way to ensure it goes on track is to have an agenda and someone <a href=\"https://www.wildapricot.com/articles/how-to-write-effective-meeting-minutes\">taking minutes</a>. This can show your staff and stakeholders you are interested in them and sometimes it is better to talk about things face to face than behind an email account.</p>\n<p><strong>Time Management</strong></p>\n<p>Another big skill you must have as a project manager is being able to manage your time effectively to meet deadlines. This includes being able to delegate effectively so you know the work will be done. Making a to-do list each day might help you identify priorities. Sometimes you may need to be the bad guy and get rid of a team member who is not doing what they should be within time limits.

Before that, he served as the CEO of Wotif.com for a seven-year period.</p>\n<p><strong>DB: What excites you about taking the reins of Tyro? </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Cooke:</strong> Tyro has established itself as a banking\u00a0champion for Australia\u2019s small and medium businesses. It has done that by\u00a0having a singular focus on \u2013 and commitment to the SME sector. Being part of that success\u00a0story and leading the energetic,\u00a0agile\u00a0and innovative team at\u00a0Tyro on the next stage of their journey is what attracted me to the role.</p>\n<p><strong>DB: What is your agenda for growing the company?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Cooke:</strong> It is early days as I have not yet got in\u00a0the chair at Tyro! That said, Tyro has been exceptional\u00a0at building a payments solution that is purpose built for the SME customer. As such, my key focus will be building on the 20,000 plus customers that have joined Tyro\u00a0and lifting the awareness of what Tyro\u00a0currently has on offer, including our\u00a0newer products in deposits and lending.\u00a0That focus will see us continue to innovate and improve, offering an experience for SMEs that is well\u00a0beyond that offered by the big banks. Due to the flexibility that Tyro\u2019s\u00a0large and\u00a0talented in-house engineering capability provides, the company is in a\u00a0fantastic position to drive innovation for the benefit of our SME customers.</p>\n<p><strong>DB: What is your assessment of the big banks?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Cooke:</strong> I think it is fair to say a lot of\u00a0consumers have been taken for granted by the traditional banks and Australia\u2019s\u00a0small and medium businesses have certainly not been an exception in this regard.\u00a0A lack of focus on the specific needs of SMEs,\u00a0coupled with a lack of product innovation\u00a0and a considerable technological deficit, has seen the SME sector remain underserviced\u00a0by the traditional banks. Unsurprisingly disruption occurs when these market\u00a0dynamics are evident.</p>\n<p>Tyro\u2019s focus since inception has been about\u00a0removing the\u00a0barriers\u00a0faced by SMEs in the payments\u00a0space, and has now expanded to include innovative new banking products purpose\u00a0built for the SME sector. Tyro has long\u00a0understood that Australia\u2019s SMEs are\u00a0the backbone of our economy and has focused in on their specific needs. At the\u00a0core is Tyro\u2019s seamless integration with hundreds of POS solutions, the absence\u00a0of lock-in contracts, real-time reporting,\u00a0fast processing speeds and superb\u00a024/7 local support. This focus has seen more than 20,000 customers come on\u00a0board and join Tyro. With the product suite now extending to lending and\u00a0deposits products, I believe Tyro as a business bank\u00a0providing fair,\u00a0transparent and smart banking solutions in a truly customer centric way, is\u00a0providing SMEs with simply a better alternative to the big banks.</p>\n<p><strong>DB: What learning will you apply from your past roles?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Cooke:</strong> Every business has its own unique\u00a0attributes, opportunities and culture. It is how you harness those elements\u00a0that is the critically important thing as an incoming CEO. That said, there are\u00a0some common themes from my time at\u00a0Wotif.com\u00a0and\u00a0Tatts that should be helpful\u00a0at Tyro. Both\u00a0Wotif.com\u00a0and Tatts were customer-focused businesses operating in\u00a0very competitive markets that were undergoing considerable structural change\u00a0and disruption. Both businesses had the advantage\u00a0of proprietary technology\u00a0platforms and had large teams of IT professionals to make the \u2018magic\u2019 happen. Brand,\u00a0marketing (online and traditional) and building consumer awareness are perhaps\u00a0the other areas where my experiences at\u00a0Wotif.com\u00a0and Tatts will be particularly\u00a0useful at Tyro. What I am looking forward to most is building on what has been\u00a0a very successful strategy of serving the Australian SME market with a market-leading\u00a0SME banking solution.</p>\n<p><em>Related article: <a href=\"http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/featured/lets-talk-fintech.html\">Let&#8217;s Talk&#8230; Fintech</a></em></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/featured/what-tyros-new-ceo-has-in-store-for-smes.html/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Committee endorses visa worker levy but Kate Carnell warns of angst for small businesses</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/news/committee-endorses-visa-worker-levy-but-kate-carnell-warns-of-angst-for-small-businesses.html</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/news/committee-endorses-visa-worker-levy-but-kate-carnell-warns-of-angst-for-small-businesses.html#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2018 00:36:27 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[James Harkness]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[ASBFEO]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[foreign worker]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Kate Carnell]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Migration]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[overseas worker]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Reform]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[skilled migrant visa scheme]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[skilling Australians Fund]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/?p=82687</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[A Senate committee has deemed it \u2018wholly appropriate\u2019 that employers pay a levy to access overseas workers; however, the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, Kate Carnell, considers this \u201canother blow\u201d for small businesses.

With the introduction of this levy in March 2018, the Federal Government is seeking to raise between\u00a0$1.2 billion and $1.5 billion, over a four-year period, for its Skilling Australians Fund. \u00a0It expects the Fund will support up to 300,000 apprentices, trainees, pre-apprentices and higher level skilled Australians.</p>\n<p>In its <a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Education_and_Employment/MigrationBills2017/Report\">report</a>\u00a0inquiring into both bills, the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee recommended the bills be passed by the senate on the basis that it was \u201cwholly appropriate that employers seeking access to overseas skilled workers should be required to contribute to the broader skills development of Australians\u201d.</p>\n<p>The Committee added, \u201cThe Skilling Australians Fund will support targeted investment in critical skill needs in key regions and industries across the Australian economy\u2026 While the committee acknowledges the concerns raised by submitters, on balance it considers the bills necessary to ensure that all Australians have access to adequate and high-quality skills and training opportunities.\u201d</p>\n<p>Commenting on the report, Carnell said increasing the cost to small businesses of engaging migrants on temporary visas will \u201cadd to the angst already involved in the complex and time-consuming process of securing a suitable worker\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe know that small businesses contribute significantly to the training of their own workforce and are more than happy to do this,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cHowever, in some businesses and some areas, particularly regional and rural, no amount of advertising or word of mouth is going to fill a vacancy.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is when employers look to what is probably the last resort for them, which is getting skilled workers from overseas.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are disappointed that this new legislation increases costs, timeframes and red tape.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnder the proposed legislation, business owners will have to pay an upfront training levy of up to $8,000, spend around 80 hours filling out paperwork and then wait between seven to nine months for this to be processed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWith cash flow and profit margins always a challenge, and no human resource or finance departments to support the process, like big business, small businesses might just walk away as it is too hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis legislation imposes a disproportionate burden on Australia\u2019s small businesses and limits their capacity to employ people to run or grow their business.&#8221;</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/news/committee-endorses-visa-worker-levy-but-kate-carnell-warns-of-angst-for-small-businesses.html/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n",
