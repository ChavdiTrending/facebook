Cue IOHK. Named after its CEO and Founder, Charles Hoskinson (@<span class=\"username u-dir\" dir=\"ltr\"><a class=\"ProfileHeaderCard-screennameLink u-linkComplex js-nav\" href=\"https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles\">IOHK_Charles</a>). This is his latest project on the resume, next to other impressive attributes like being the CEO of the 2nd most valuable coin, Ethereum back in 2013.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Input Output (aka IOHK) is a\u00a0research and development company how use peer-to-peer innovations of blockchain to build accessible financial services for all. While that&#8217;s a nice lofty ambition, its their visualisation of the blockchain that&#8217;s easily their most visually impressive piece of work to date. Don&#8217;t forget to check out their <a href=\"https://iohk.io/projects/cardano/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cardano project</a> while you&#8217;re on the site.</p>\n<p>When you visit\u00a0<a href=\"https://iohk.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://iohk.io</a>\u00a0you&#8217;ll be invited to view click the button &#8216;Explore the 3D Blockchain&#8217;.. you should click this button. This takes you to an amazing 3D representation of the blocks on the blockchain, complete with dynamic lighting effects that track your mouse movements, there&#8217;s crazy reflections, diffused light, highlights, translucency and interactivity. As you scroll your mouse wheel, you&#8217;ll move through the blockchain transactions, spiraling back through time. You have the ability to select any of the blocks and get additional details.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0PeO5uKYWKQ?ecver=1\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Each block is actually made up of batches of transactions. By selecting a block, you can discover data about that block, like their unique ID on the blockchain, the date/time of the transaction, input/output value, fees and the number of transactions that made up that block.</p>\n<p>Production Director, Rouska Lundin said,</p>\n<blockquote><p>As the technology becomes more pervasive and it impacts on everyday life more, it\u2019s important that we attempt to\u00a0<a title=\"The Next Web - Bitcoin as Art\" href=\"https://thenextweb.com/distract/2018/01/17/bitcoin-as-art-this-breath-taking-visualization-might-distract-you-from-the-dip/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">explain it in a meaningful way</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As if the visuals weren&#8217;t enough, the unique block hash is translated into a perfectly unique visualisation and sound clip. While dynamic sounds are impressive, they sound like midi files from the 90s. My buddy Clinton suggested a soundscape that closer aligned to the visuals users were seeing, like mechanical sounds of the future of the robots from Transformers. I have to say I agree wholeheartedly.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6PNgS2Dnz9o?start=78\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>If you have a block hash from a transaction you made, you can insert it by searching at the bottom of the screen and be taken directly to your block. Want to save it, just right-click and save an image, those who understand web content will know how awesome and difficult that feature is.</p>\n<p>So now to get to the detail on how and why this was created. The company that created it was Kuva, an award winning digital art and experience design studio, creating new forms of interaction and audiovisual aesthetic. Founder Mark Ludin gave a talk back in January on how the Symphony of Blockchains was constructed. It does run for 25 minutes but if you&#8217;re into web development at all, it is definitely worth your time.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f0Pzg50QnI4\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The whole thing comes together as an amazing was to visually understand the series of transactions that combine over a series of time, like elements of an Apple TimeMachine backup, or Microsoft&#8217;s Windows 10 Timeline feature, just way better than both.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also been other attempts to visualise cryptocurrency, by our own Data61 from CSIRO with <a href=\"http://www.ethviewer.live/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EthViewer,</a>\u00a0but that has nothing on the work from Kuva. Its not surprising they have worked with some of the biggest brands in the world, like Google, Twitter, Adidas, and Toyota.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"183472\" data-permalink=\"https://techau.com.au/this-visualisation-of-the-blockchain-is-nothing-short-of-incredible/blockchain1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlockChain1.jpg?fit=1676%2C937&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1676,937\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Jason Cartwright&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1518732283&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"BlockChain1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlockChain1.jpg?fit=900%2C503&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlockChain1.jpg?fit=893%2C499&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-183472\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlockChain1.jpg?resize=894%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"894\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlockChain1.jpg?w=1676&amp;ssl=1 1676w, https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlockChain1.jpg?resize=900%2C503&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlockChain1.jpg?resize=1024%2C572&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 893px) 100vw, 893px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://techau.com.au/this-visualisation-of-the-blockchain-is-nothing-short-of-incredible/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">183471</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Kogan is now worth more than Myer, online winning over retail</title>\n\t\t<link>https://techau.com.au/kogan-is-now-worth-more-than-myer-online-winning-over-retail/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://techau.com.au/kogan-is-now-worth-more-than-myer-online-winning-over-retail/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2018 20:33:04 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jason Cartwright]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Business]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Kogan]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Myer]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Online]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Retail]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://techau.com.au/?p=183466</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[In the battle between online and bricks and mortar retailers, its clear the direction the world is heading.

This afternoon CommBank customers received text messages announcing the change which actually lists the ban as applying to all virtual currency.

This afternoon CommBank customers received text messages announcing the change which actually lists the ban as applying to all virtual currency.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the brutal part, the ban is effectively immediately. If you had plans to purchase more crypto on credit, wait for the appreciation of the investment, then pay off your credit card, then think again. The company published a post on the announcement on their <a href=\"https://www.commbank.com.au/guidance/newsroom/virtual-currency-credit-card-block-201802.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">corporate blog</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Due to the unregulated and highly volatile nature of virtual currencies, customers will no longer be able to use their CommBank credit cards to buy virtual currencies. This will come into effect as of 14 February 2018.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ironically the same day CommBank announced the ban on crpto, Western Union confirmed they&#8217;re working with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com.au/ripple-xrp-western-union-payments-testing-2018-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ripple</a>.</p>\n<p>While the restriction on credit card usage for virtual currencies will also apply to Bankwest credit cards. Commonwealth Banks says\u00a0customers will still be able to buy and sell virtual currencies using other CommBank transaction accounts, and their debit cards.</p>\n<p>Virtual currency is a strange description, when is currency digital, when is it virtual, given the terms are often used interchangeably. Given this definition could cause some confusion, I reached out to CommBank on Twitter and they confirmed digital currency services &#8216;aka virtual currencies&#8217; like PayPal are not included.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hi techAU, using PayPal is using your own money, therefore no it is not a virtual currency. ^Lish</p>\n<p>&mdash; CommBank (@CommBank) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CommBank/status/963698629155348480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 14, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<p>With the first of Australia&#8217;s big 4 banks now banning the use of credit cards to buy crypto, it&#8217;ll be interesting to see if the other 3, and smaller banks follow suit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://techau.com.au/commonwealth-bank-of-australia-kills-crytpo-purchases-of-virtual-currencies-with-credit-cards/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">183461</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Supercars livery designers are killing it in 2018</title>\n\t\t<link>https://techau.com.au/supercars-livery-designers-are-killing-it-in-2018/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://techau.com.au/supercars-livery-designers-are-killing-it-in-2018/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2018 20:51:08 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jason Cartwright]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Sports]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Vehicle]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://techau.com.au/?p=183448</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The 2018 Supercars seasons starts early March.

Thankfully in 2018, the size limitations are fading fast with 1 and even 2TB SSD sizes readily available. The speeds and reliability of SSDs easily outperforming spinning drives, with the last remaining attribute that needs work, being price. Over the last few weeks, I&#8217;ve had the chance to have the the latest\u00a0MX500 1TB SSD from Crucial in my PC. Performance The manufacturer specs for the 2.5&#8243; drive lists sequential read speeds of up to 530 MB/s and write speeds of 510 MB/s. In testing, these numbers were pretty close to the mark with CrystalDiskMark 6 showing sequential read speeds of 549.9MB/s, actually faster [&#8230;]]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img data-attachment-id=\"183420\" data-permalink=\"https://techau.com.au/review-the-new-crucial-1tb-mx500-ssd/edf-217/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_20180118_184710.jpg?fit=1600%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;MHA-L29&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;edf&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1516301231&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;3.95&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.05&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;edf&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Crucial 1TB SSD\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_20180118_184710.jpg?fit=900%2C675&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_20180118_184710.jpg?fit=893%2C670&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-183420\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_20180118_184710.jpg?resize=894%2C671&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"894\" height=\"671\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_20180118_184710.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_20180118_184710.jpg?resize=900%2C675&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_20180118_184710.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_20180118_184710.jpg?resize=240%2C180&amp;ssl=1 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 893px) 100vw, 893px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>By now we all understand the benefits of SSD and want them in every device we own. Thankfully in 2018, the size limitations are fading fast with 1 and even 2TB SSD sizes readily available. The speeds and reliability of SSDs easily outperforming spinning drives, with the last remaining attribute that needs work, being price.</p>\n<p>Over the last few weeks, I&#8217;ve had the chance to have the the latest\u00a0MX500 1TB SSD from Crucial in my PC.</p>\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n<p>The manufacturer specs for the 2.5&#8243; drive lists sequential read speeds of up to 530 MB/s and write speeds of 510 MB/s. In testing, these numbers were pretty close to the mark with CrystalDiskMark 6 showing sequential read speeds of 549.9MB/s, actually faster than the listed spec, that almost never happens. When it comes to write speeds, I had a little less than the listed number with 483.8MB/s, but seriously these numbers are insane compared to drives from a couple of years ago.</p>\n<p>By way of comparison, I ran the same test against a secondary drive in the PC, a WD 10TB spinning disk drive. The read speed was a lowly 189.8MB/s and write speeds just 180.2MB/s. This shows the vast difference between an SSD drive that&#8217;s great as your boot drive, the drive you want to launch applications on and transact day-to-day data for the fastest experience possible. The large archive drive is a way to store large volumes of data, but is simply no match for the speed of the Crucial SSD.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"183444\" data-permalink=\"https://techau.com.au/review-the-new-crucial-1tb-mx500-ssd/speeds/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Speeds.jpg?fit=1212%2C687&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1212,687\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Jason Cartwright&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1518470999&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Speeds\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Speeds.jpg?fit=900%2C510&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Speeds.jpg?fit=893%2C506&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-183444\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Speeds.jpg?resize=894%2C507&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"894\" height=\"507\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Speeds.jpg?w=1212&amp;ssl=1 1212w, https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Speeds.jpg?resize=900%2C510&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Speeds.jpg?resize=1024%2C580&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 893px) 100vw, 893px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p>Crucial includes their second generation Micron 3D NAND technology and is 45x more energy efficient than a typical hard drive.

Kellermann felt online students were missing out on the full lecture experience, missing the critical use of visual aids and nonverbal communication and the ability for 2-way communication to raise questions and participate in class discussions.</p>\n<p>In training documentation to staff and students, UNSW provide stats to know about Teams.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can create up to 250 Teams</li>\n<li>UNSW can create up to 500,000 Teams</li>\n<li>A team can have up to 999 members</li>\n<li>A chat can have up to 20 members</li>\n<li>A meeting within Teams can have up to 80 members</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Kellermann wanted students accessing courses online to have the uncompromised experience of the lectures, in a framework that his colleagues could easily replicate. Before Teams, the lecuturer cobbled together a makeshift solution, using an LMS that included streaming video, downloadable notes, and a chat room for posting questions and comments, but scaling the system to other staff was too complex and lacked seamless integration between tools.</p>\n<p>Kellermann took his needs to the UNSW IT department, which gave birth to the Teams classroom pilot. As the business was already familiar with Office 365, in just 2 weeks they had a customised solution in Teams for a group of 370 students. Students could stream video lectures (with closed captions if desired), take and view live-synchronized notes, ask questions from their smartphones or PCs, and access class materials all from within the Teams environment. You know, the things modern learning providers should be offering in 2018.</p>\n<p>Beyond improving the communication experience for web students, the fluid, interactive nature of Teams has dramatically enhanced student engagement across the board.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"183438\" data-permalink=\"https://techau.com.au/unsw-pilot-microsoft-teams-exam-pass-rate-increased-from-65-to-85/a-new-vision-for-intelligent-communications-in-office-365-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/A-new-vision-for-intelligent-communications-in-Office-365-1.png?fit=900%2C506&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"900,506\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"A-new-vision-for-intelligent-communications-in-Office-365-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/A-new-vision-for-intelligent-communications-in-Office-365-1.png?fit=900%2C506&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/A-new-vision-for-intelligent-communications-in-Office-365-1.png?fit=893%2C502&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-183438\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/A-new-vision-for-intelligent-communications-in-Office-365-1.png?resize=894%2C503&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"894\" height=\"503\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Kellerman says,</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cEngagement is one of the most important things in teaching.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to get your students into it, just like a good movie or a good football match. Using Teams grabs the students\u2019 attention and makes learning part of their everyday lives\u2014<wbr />inside of the classroom and out.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The results of the trial have been incredible. Kellermann found an 800% increase in discussion posts since moving to Teams. At the conclusion of his course, 100% of the students who participated in the student experience survey agreed that they \u201cfelt part of the learning community.\u201d something traditionally difficult to achieve with remote learners. This increased engagement has also had a measurable impact on student success. Kellermann reported that the exam pass rate for the class using Teams increased from 65% to 85%.</p>\n<p>In addition, Kellermann\u2019s pilot demonstrates that using Teams can simplify class administration, thanks to its integration with other Office 365 apps. Lecturers can quickly push a meeting, assignment, or exam date out to students from their own Outlook calendars, a convenient and familiar experience. Lecture notes automatically synchronize in OneNote Class Notebooks, while videos are available through Microsoft Stream.</p>\n<p>Kellermann went on to say,</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI can\u2019t express to you how joyful it is to end a lecture and know that I don\u2019t have to spend another hour or more on these tasks.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the pilot program, UNSW have seen a very organic adoption process. Kellermann\u2019s students began to use the chat feature within minutes and now they\u2019re sharing their enthusiasm with peers and professors. In 2018, the trial will expand to a rollout across UNSW.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://techau.com.au/unsw-pilot-microsoft-teams-exam-pass-rate-increased-from-65-to-85/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">183435</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>2018 Mustang is coming to Australia mid-2018, packed with technology</title>\n\t\t<link>https://techau.com.au/2018-mustang-is-coming-to-australia-mid-2018-packed-with-technology/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://techau.com.au/2018-mustang-is-coming-to-australia-mid-2018-packed-with-technology/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2018 07:14:59 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jason Cartwright]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ford]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Vehicle]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[2018]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Mustang]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://techau.com.au/?p=183425</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Ford have confirmed their updated 2018 Mustang is heading to Australia.

This offers three separate views, Normal, Sport and Track modes which lets you make things like the RPM front and center to make sure you hit your shift points at the track. On Normal mode you may prefer info on fuel economy and current speed to be the prioritised display items. There&#8217;s also customisations to the colour and gauge layout.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">An all-new Mustang MyMode offers customers the ability to save their favourite drive settings, including suspension and steering preferences, for next time they get behind the wheel. This means an owner feels like its their car, the way they like it, not reset to generic factory settings everytime the key turns off.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNoSpacing\">One of the best features of the car has been its engine note, particularly from the big V8 5.0L model. Now Mustang is going further, allowing its engine note to be adjusted. This delivers an audible experience like never before, an all-new active valve exhaust system is standard on all GT models, with a fully variable soundtrack to match the entire acceleration range. It seems Ford love modes, to add to the Mustang&#8217;s drive and steering modes, there&#8217;s now 4 new exhaust modes: Normal, Quiet, Track and Sport, also known as Run to the shops, Baby&#8217;s sleeping, Weekend fun and Get your Smile on.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The all-new electronic control system includes unique tunes for different drive modes and features real-time adaptive shift scheduling to ensure the right gear at the right time. The steering wheel-mounted shift paddles are back to give you the maximum manual control, but this time you&#8217;ll be moving through a new 10-speed transmission in the Auto, on both the Mustang GT and the Mustang EcoBoost models. Thankfully Ford engineers have heard the feedback and have improved things with faster gear-changes and an optimised shift-pattern for performance and efficiency.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The suspension gets an upgrade on all models, with new shock absorbers set to deliver better ride control, while a new cross-axis joint in the rear suspension leads to increased lateral stiffness, and innovative stabiliser bars bring sharper response and handling.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"183432\" data-permalink=\"https://techau.com.au/2018-mustang-is-coming-to-australia-mid-2018-packed-with-technology/fordmustang008/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang008.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS-1D X Mark II&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1502211368&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Stuart G W Price\\rwww.S-P.tv&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;95&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;125&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.00625&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"fordmustang008\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang008.jpg?fit=900%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang008.jpg?fit=893%2C596&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-183432\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang008.jpg?resize=894%2C596&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"894\" height=\"596\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang008.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang008.jpg?resize=900%2C600&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang008.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang008.jpg?resize=272%2C182&amp;ssl=1 272w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 893px) 100vw, 893px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">For the first time, MagneRide damper technology is an option for Mustang, designed to optimise ride and handling in all situations. Previously exclusive to the Mustang Shelby GT350, the MagneRide damping system allows automatic adjustment of each corner \u2013 up to 1,000 times per second \u2013 enabling better responsiveness and lateral performance.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">When it comes to safety smarts, the 2018 Mustang gets a major overhaul over last year&#8217;s model. Under the banner of Ford Driver-Assist Technology (DAT), customers now have access to Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) with pedestrian detection as standard, Adaptive Cruise Control (On my must have list), Lane-Departure Warning and Lane-Keeping Assist. Mustang also benefits from Auto-levelling headlights, as well as automatic high beam, further reducing the driver\u2019s workload.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNoSpacing\">Ford SYNC3 is standard on 2018 Mustang, which includes Emergency Assist. Emergency Assist automatically calls emergency services for faster response times in the event of a road traffic collision. SYNC 3 also offers Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility at no extra cost, as well as an 8.0-inch full-colour reversing camera display.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"183429\" data-permalink=\"https://techau.com.au/2018-mustang-is-coming-to-australia-mid-2018-packed-with-technology/fordmustang042/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang042.jpg?fit=1600%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;GFX 50S&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1502224079&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;64&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;125&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.33333333333333&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"fordmustang042\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang042.jpg?fit=900%2C675&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang042.jpg?fit=893%2C670&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-183429\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang042.jpg?resize=894%2C671&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"894\" height=\"671\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang042.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang042.jpg?resize=900%2C675&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang042.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang042.jpg?resize=240%2C180&amp;ssl=1 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 893px) 100vw, 893px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h2>Design</h2>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">When it comes to the design of the new Mustang, you&#8217;ll notice the aerodynamic upgrades immediately with upper and lower front grilles, and a new position for the bonnet air-intakes. For the first time, the entire Mustang line up will feature all-LED front lights including signature tri-bar lighting \u2013 a first for Mustang in Australia.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The rear of the car gets revised LED tail lights for a more technical look, plus a new bumper, fascia and available performance spoiler. The V8-powered Mustang GT boasts a quad-tip exhaust as standard, along with a black rear diffuser.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Mustang EcoBoost now features a fresh alloy wheel design, while for a different look, the 19-inch Lustre Nickel alloy is available as a factory option. The GT carries over the mesh design from the current model, while also offering an optional five-spoked 19-inch forged alloy.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">There&#8217;s new colours for a new year with the all-new signature Orange Fury as well as Kona Blue and Royal Crimson \u2013 combined with Over the Top (OTT) stripe packages mean that enthusiasts can order a Mustang with the look they\u2019re after. In fact, the 2018 Mustang offers more factory-fit options than ever before, including a new single-wing rear spoiler (also part of the US-market Mustang Performance Pack).</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Increased personalisation extends to the 2018 Mustang\u2019s new cockpit, characterised by improved touch points and visual cues for a more premium look and feel. The centre console adds a new hand-stitched wrap with contrast stitching and padded knee bolsters while door handles, rings and bezels are finished in aluminium.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Restyled seating surfaces feature new patterns, while there\u2019s also six-way leather-upholstered Recaro sports seating as a factory-fitted option. All Mustangs feature an instrument panel with an updated Mustang badge, while there\u2019s a new key fob design.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"183428\" data-permalink=\"https://techau.com.au/2018-mustang-is-coming-to-australia-mid-2018-packed-with-technology/fordmustang039/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang039.jpg?fit=1600%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;14&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;GFX 50S&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1502050214&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;56.5&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;3&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"fordmustang039\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang039.jpg?fit=900%2C675&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang039.jpg?fit=893%2C670&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-183428\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang039.jpg?resize=894%2C671&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"894\" height=\"671\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang039.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang039.jpg?resize=900%2C675&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang039.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang039.jpg?resize=240%2C180&amp;ssl=1 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 893px) 100vw, 893px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h2 class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><b>Performance</b></h2>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Performance is at the core of Mustang DNA, offering drivers a unique thrill of acceleration and cornering for the ultimate fun-to-drive experience. Ford\u2019s legendary 5.0-litre V8 engine has been thoroughly reworked, with more power and the ability to rev higher than any Mustang GT before.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The 2018 Mustang GT has 33kW more power than its predecessor, delivering a peak of 339kW \u2013 around 450 horsepower \u2013 as standard. This power increase has been achieved with the first application for Mustang of Ford\u2019s new dual-fuel, high-pressure direct injection and low-pressure port fuel injection on a V8 engine \u2013 delivering robust low-end torque, high-rpm power, and improved fuel efficiency. The 5.0-litre Coyote V8 also packs 556Nm of torque, a jump of 26Nm, while the EcoBoost delivers 224kW with 9Nm more torque, now 441Nm.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">A new 10-speed SelectShift automatic transmission, available with both EcoBoost and V8 engines, is the best automatic Mustang has ever offered and boasts Ford-patented technology. With a wide-ratio span and optimised gear spacing, this all-new transmission helps deliver higher average power for acceleration \u2013 improving responsiveness and performance. Compared to the previous six-speed, the new 10-speed transmission has quicker shift times, better low-speed tip-in response and significantly reduced friction losses.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNoSpacing\">The manual transmission for both engine options has been upgraded for optimal torque. For the V8, the manual transmission has been totally redesigned to include a twin-disc clutch and dual-mass flywheel to increase torque capability and deliver more efficient clutch modulation.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"183431\" data-permalink=\"https://techau.com.au/2018-mustang-is-coming-to-australia-mid-2018-packed-with-technology/fordmustang045/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang045.jpg?fit=1600%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;11&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;GFX 50S&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1502047573&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;32&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.5&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"fordmustang045\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang045.jpg?fit=900%2C675&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang045.jpg?fit=893%2C670&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-183431\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang045.jpg?resize=894%2C671&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"894\" height=\"671\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang045.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang045.jpg?resize=900%2C675&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang045.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/techau.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fordmustang045.jpg?resize=240%2C180&amp;ssl=1 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 893px) 100vw, 893px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>2018 Ford Mustang Line-up</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ford Mustang EcoBoost Fastback (manual) $49,990 MLP</li>\n<li>Ford Mustang EcoBoost Fastback (automatic) $52,990 MLP</li>\n<li>Ford Mustang EcoBoost Convertible (automatic) $59,490 MLP</li>\n<li>Ford Mustang GT Fastback (manual) $62,990 MLP</li>\n<li>Ford Mustang GT Fastback (automatic) $66,259 MLP incl LCT</li>\n<li>Ford Mustang GT Convertible (automatic) $74,709 MLP incl LCT</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>2018 Ford Mustang \u2013 Key Factory Options</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>OTT Stripes \u2013 black $650</li>\n<li>OTT Stripes (Fastback only) \u2013 white $650</li>\n<li>Single-wing rear spoiler (Fastback only) $750</li>\n<li>Recaro leather seats (Fastback only) $3,000</li>\n<li>19-inch Lustre Nickel alloys (EcoBoost only) $500</li>\n<li>19-inch Forged alloys (GT Only) $2,500</li>\n<li>MagneRide<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />\u00a0Suspension $2,750</li>\n</ul>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://techau.com.au/2018-mustang-is-coming-to-australia-mid-2018-packed-with-technology/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">183425</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>VLC 3.0 Vetinari is out, 3 years in the making</title>\n\t\t<link>https://techau.com.au/vlc-3-0-vetinari-is-out-3-years-in-the-making/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://techau.com.au/vlc-3-0-vetinari-is-out-3-years-in-the-making/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 10 Feb 2018 10:30:55 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jason Cartwright]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Software]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[360]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[HDR]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Update]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Video]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[VLC]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://techau.com.au/?p=183410</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[If you want a cross-platform application that&#8217;s capable of playing basically any video format ever created, then you want VLC.
