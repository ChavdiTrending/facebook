The damage was to the wall before the bridge, the bridge itself wasn&amp;rsquo;t damaged,&amp;rdquo; Mr Lombard said.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class='imgFCap'&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://media.central.ie/media/images/m/MinaneBridgeTruckCrash160218c_large.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The damaged wall, which sectioned off a piece of land and was not a barrier between the road and river, was cordoned off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ietopstories/~4/8T5ezM8J13g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n      <category term=\"2.0.0.0\" />\r\n      <category term=\"Ireland\" />\r\n      <contributor>\r\n         <name>IrishExaminer.com</name>\r\n         <email>tcmtext@tcm.ie</email>\r\n         <uri>http://www.irishexaminer.com/</uri>\r\n      </contributor>\r\n      <published>2018-02-17T00:00:00+00:00</published>\r\n   <feedburner:origLink>http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/truck-drivers-lucky-escape-on-icy-road-467284.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n   <entry>\r\n      <id>467283</id>\r\n      <title>Juveniles committed 45% of sex offences in 2016</title>\r\n      <updated>2018-02-17</updated>\r\n      <author>\r\n         <name>        Se\u00e1n McC\u00e1rthaigh    </name>\r\n      </author>\r\n      <link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://feeds.examiner.ie/~r/ietopstories/~3/o4uD3PPVNDY/juveniles-committed-45-of-sex-offences-in-2016-467283.html\" />\r\n      <summary type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Juvenile offenders were responsible for almost half of all sexual offences recorded by garda&amp;iacute; in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>\r\n      <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juvenile offenders were responsible for almost half of all sexual offences recorded by garda&amp;iacute; in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shocking scale of involvement of children and teenagers, aged 18 or under, in rape and sexual assaults, is revealed in an annual report of the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Young offenders were linked to 45% of all sexual offences committed that year.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Sexual offences are one of the few crime categories where offending rates by young people are on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There were 334 sexual offences by juvenile offenders recorded in 2016, an annual increase of 39%.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;They include 114 cases of rape and 21 of child pornography, while the respective figures in 2015 were 47 and nine.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Assistant Garda Commissioner Pat Leahy, the chairman of the GJDP&amp;rsquo;s monitoring committee, said it had identified a risk attached to the current process for the management and supervision of child sexual offenders.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Training and policy development is required in this area, in order for this issue to be effectively addressed,&amp;rdquo; said Mr Leahy.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, there was a 10% reduction in crimes committed by juvenile offenders in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The GJDP report shows a total of 17,615 incidents were referred to it in 2016 &amp;mdash; a decrease of 1,898 crimes compared to the previous year. There were two murder cases.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There was a related reduction in the number of young offenders &amp;mdash; 9,451 in 2016 &amp;mdash; a decrease of 3.6%, and the lowest level in the programme&amp;rsquo;s 15-year history.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Garda&amp;iacute; identified 436 juveniles as being responsible for six or more crimes during the year, including seven who were aged 12.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;More than a quarter of all young offenders referred to the GJDP were aged 14 or under.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The juvenile diversion programme, which was established in 2003, is designed to allow young offenders to avoid having their crime processed through the courts system.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Theft was the most common crime recorded by juvenile offenders &amp;mdash; in 31% of cases, followed by public order (22%) and damage to property (10%).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Approximately three-quarters of all young offenders referred to the programme were males.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The report shows juvenile offenders were also linked to 30% of all robberies, 19% of assaults, 23% of thefts, and 26% of burglaries in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The number of children referred to the GJDP in 2016, from the garda southern region, which covers Cork, Kerry, and Limerick, fell by 2%, to 1,924, due to large reductions in numbers from the Cork West and Limerick area.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;However, there was an increase in the number referred from Cork City &amp;mdash; up 10%, to 628, and up 15% in Kerry, to 338.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ietopstories/~4/o4uD3PPVNDY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n      <category term=\"2.0.0.0\" />\r\n      <category term=\"Ireland\" />\r\n      <contributor>\r\n         <name>IrishExaminer.com</name>\r\n         <email>tcmtext@tcm.ie</email>\r\n         <uri>http://www.irishexaminer.com/</uri>\r\n      </contributor>\r\n      <published>2018-02-17T00:00:00+00:00</published>\r\n   <feedburner:origLink>http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/juveniles-committed-45-of-sex-offences-in-2016-467283.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n   <entry>\r\n      <id>467282</id>\r\n      <title>Ireland 2040: Government defend plan branded a \u2018marketing exercise\u2019</title>\r\n      <updated>2018-02-17</updated>\r\n      <author>\r\n         <name>By Elaine Loughlin, Fiachra \u00d3 Cionnaith, and Juno McEnroe    </name>\r\n      </author>\r\n      <link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://feeds.examiner.ie/~r/ietopstories/~3/2hpgjfUjDEc/ireland-2040-government-defend-plan-branded-a-marketing-exercise-467282.html\" />\r\n      <summary type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;The Government&amp;rsquo;s grand plan for the future of the country has been branded little more than a &amp;ldquo;marketing exercise&amp;rdquo; with most of its promises and a third of its funding previously announced.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>\r\n      <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government&amp;rsquo;s grand plan for the future of the country has been branded little more than a &amp;ldquo;marketing exercise&amp;rdquo; with most of its promises and a third of its funding previously announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Taoiseach is under fire over Project Ireland 2040 which the opposition has claimed contains 179 projects that have already been published. However, the Taoiseach and ministers quickly moved to defend the framework last night, strongly denying it is simply an election manifesto.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The plan contains significant transport, housing, health and education projects for the next generation as well as a blueprint to rebalance growth between rural and urban areas.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Key proposals include a second runway at Dublin Airport and regional airport investments as well as the Metro for Dublin and Luas lines, including in Cork.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Over &amp;euro;7bn will go on national and regional roads while rural and urban areas will get &amp;euro;3bn in funds.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In health, 2,600 acute hospital beds are also promised as are 10 new hospitals over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Some &amp;euro;22bn has also been allocated for climate change, while there are also promises to build 110,000 social houses over 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;euro;500m innovation fund for start-up companies and the new M20 between Limerick and Cork are among the promises. The Government also hopes to prioritise growth in towns, such as Sligo and Athlone.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class='imgFCap'&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://media.central.ie/media/images/p/Projectireland2040ConferenceSligoLeoVaradkar160218_large.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Responding to the Government&amp;rsquo;s &amp;euro;116bn two-decade plan, Fianna F&amp;aacute;il leader Miche&amp;aacute;l Martin said &amp;ldquo;this is a very cynical exercise&amp;rdquo; and that the project is effectively about the launch of the Government&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;next election manifesto&amp;rdquo; at the taxpayer&amp;rsquo;s expense.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Noting the fact his own party believes at least 179 of Project Ireland 2040&amp;rsquo;s initiatives have already been announced, including &amp;euro;40bn of the &amp;euro;116bn earmarked, Mr Martin said &amp;ldquo;there is the element of the political wheeze in this, so you&amp;rsquo;ll forgive me for being a bit cynical&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe defended the plan stating: &amp;ldquo;We already have a set of commitments that we have made to communities and citizens all over the country as a result of the last two budgets.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If I had stood up today and excluded those commitments, the same opposition would be lambasting us for breaking our word to our citizens, of course we are honouring the commitment that we already have but for many years beyond that we are honouring new commitments, outlining new things that we want to do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Asked to provide 10 tangible and costed projects that were announced for the first time under the project the Taoiseach said it was &amp;ldquo;a challenging question&amp;rdquo; to answer &amp;ldquo;off the top of my head&amp;rdquo;. However he cited:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul class=\"listbullet\"&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Bus connects for Dublin &amp;mdash; &amp;euro;2bn;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Bus connects for Cork and Galway;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The M20;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;euro;1.6bn investment in health IT;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The N4 from Collooney to Castlebaldwin;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The DCU project.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The strategy also looks at rebalancing growth. The project says three quarters of growth will be outside Dublin, with 50% of the projected population growth planned for our towns, villages and rural areas and 50% for cities.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class='imgFCap'&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://media.central.ie/media/images/p/Projectireland2040ConferenceSligoLeoVaradkarSimonCoveney160218_large.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;T&amp;aacute;naiste Simon Coveney said there was a need to change how Ireland was growing, particularly to tackle sprawl.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Sinn F&amp;eacute;in was equally critical of the apparent plan gaps, with Greens leader Eamon Ryan saying it poses more questions than answers and Labour leader Brendan Howlin and deputy leader Alan Kelly saying the plan was open to potential legal action.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Irish Planning Institute&amp;rsquo;s president Joe Corr said while a two-decade infrastructure strategy is a &amp;ldquo;mature step&amp;rdquo;, there are still serious gaps in the document which must be addressed and that the document is more about &amp;ldquo;politics following politics rather than politics following planning&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ietopstories/~4/2hpgjfUjDEc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n      <category term=\"2.0.0.0\" />\r\n      <category term=\"Ireland\" />\r\n      <contributor>\r\n         <name>IrishExaminer.com</name>\r\n         <email>tcmtext@tcm.ie</email>\r\n         <uri>http://www.irishexaminer.com/</uri>\r\n      </contributor>\r\n      <published>2018-02-17T00:00:00+00:00</published>\r\n   <feedburner:origLink>http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/ireland-2040-government-defend-plan-branded-a-marketing-exercise-467282.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n   <entry>\r\n      <id>467281</id>\r\n      <title>1916 medals awarded to Defence Forces sold on Ebay</title>\r\n      <updated>2018-02-17</updated>\r\n      <author>\r\n         <name>Sean O\u2019Riordan, Defence Correspondent</name>\r\n      </author>\r\n      <link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://feeds.examiner.ie/~r/ietopstories/~3/nWOKpbKZwvk/1916-medals-awarded-to-defence-forces-sold-on-ebay-467281.html\" />\r\n      <summary type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Special medals given to members of the Defence Forces to commemorate the 1916 centenary are being sold on&amp;nbsp;Ebay&amp;nbsp;and similar online auction sites.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>\r\n      <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Special medals given to members of the Defence Forces to commemorate the 1916 centenary are being sold on&amp;nbsp;Ebay&amp;nbsp;and similar online auction sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senator, who is a former soldier, said he is &amp;ldquo;very saddened&amp;rdquo; to discover this, but believes young soldiers are selling them to make ends meet because they are so poorly paid.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Senator Gerard Craughwell said he believes that older soldiers who have served on the border and in overseas UN postings would &amp;ldquo;be very unlikely to part company with them because they would value what they represent&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He said in his opinion, it is more likely that they would be sold by younger members of the Defence Forces who don&amp;rsquo;t yet value their meaning and are trying to make a few euro to pay for fuel and to feed their families.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;One 1916 Commemorative Medal, together with the box it was issued in, was on sale on Ebay yesterday with an asking price of &amp;pound;235 (&amp;euro;264.82).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Craughwell believes that the medals he&amp;rsquo;s seen for sale are genuine. However, it should be noted there have been cases in the past where close inspection of military medals from other countries have shown they were fake.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Slightly more than 9,000 commemorative medals were handed out to members of the Permanent Defence Forces and a further 4,000 were given to the Reserve Defence Forces.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Craughwell said the manner in which the medals were handed out also has to be questioned: &amp;ldquo;I know of one soldier with 44 years of service who retired in December 2015 who didn&amp;rsquo;t qualify for the medal.

The sentence was backdated to December 22, 2017, as Walton has been remanded in custody since that time.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Frank Buttimer, solicitor, said: &amp;ldquo;We have not been able to advance the position of accessing appropriate residential accommodation suitable to his circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The court had determined it was a medical and social problem as opposed to a legal one and a matter for the State to provide services for him commensurate with his need.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He (Gary Walton) does have an appreciation of his medical difficulties.

Credit card spending was largely similar to the same period in 2016, experiencing a minor increase of &amp;euro;19m.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Total e-commerce expenditure was &amp;euro;1.34bn in December, with &amp;euro;949m and &amp;euro;389m attributable to debit cards and credit cards respectively. The total expenditure on e-commerce in December value was 15% higher than the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;E-commerce accounted for 21% of new transactions on all cards during the month. It now forms 26% of debit card spending and 40% of credit card purchases.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Debit card PoS has spending had grown to over three times the value of credit card spending in December.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There were increases across all categories of spending, but social and services spending had the highest increases over the year - both at 17%.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Within services, debit card payments for professional services have increased by 21% since December 2016, while a similar trend is evident for restaurants/dining, which recorded a 20% rise.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Credit cards also experienced increases in total spending.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The total expenditure in social, retail and services grew by 2%, 1% and 3% respectively. Professional services experienced the largest growth of any category, increasing by 8%. In contrast, spending on entertainment (1%), health (2%) and clothing (2%) experienced minor decreases.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Just under 75% of all credit card expenditure in December 2017 was split between the retail (47%) and services (26%) sectors. In comparison, retail was predominant for debit cards, accounting for 56% of new spending and triple the expenditure on services.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A significant seasonal effect can be seen in the data, particularly for debit cards, with higher expenditures outside Ireland recorded in the summer months compared to the winter months.

Superintendent Gerry Delmar, who is leading the investigation, urged anyone who was in touch with her during that time to get in contact.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://landmark.bbvms.com/p/ie_default_ads/c/2906169.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Joanne had access to a car, a silver Nissan Micra, registration number 08 MH 16073. The car was located at this address here, but we do not know where it was since February 5. Anyone who may have seen the car, or Joanne, in that time, we&amp;rsquo;d like to hear from,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Garda&amp;iacute; were waiting the results of a post-mortem examination, before formally declaring Ms Lee&amp;rsquo;s death a murder, but confirmed a murder investigation was underway, late yesterday afternoon. Supt Delmar said officers were awaiting the release of Mr Lee from hospital, before formally questioning him.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;They had no indication of when he would be released. Supt Delmar said his injuries, while not life-threatening, were serious and were consistent with a fall from a height. Garda&amp;iacute; found him lying in agony on the ground, at the rear of property, directly beneath the flat they were searching.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Only for the swift actions of a garda from Mountjoy, who stemmed his injures, well, that certainly saved him,&amp;rdquo; Supt Delmar said.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class='imgFCap'&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://media.central.ie/media/images/r/RanelaghRoadBodyScene15Feb18a_large.jpg\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class='imgFCap'&gt;&lt;span&gt;A member of the garda&amp;iacute; at the scene.

Early indications were that she might have been dead for a number of days, Supt Delmar said.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Tenants of other flats in the property were moved to hotels, while a forensics team examined the building.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Ms Lee&amp;rsquo;s uncle, John Curry, who visited the scene, spoke tearfully of her family&amp;rsquo;s anguish. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m just devastated;

for 179 &amp;ldquo;repackaged&amp;rdquo; projects that&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;simply designed to bulletproof the coalition from any general election backlash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fianna F&amp;aacute;il, Sinn F&amp;eacute;in, Labour and other opposition parties hit out at the plan after it was published in Sligo yesterday, saying the document is long on promises but short on detail.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Responding to the Government&amp;rsquo;s &amp;euro;116bn two-decade plan, Fianna F&amp;aacute;il leader Miche&amp;aacute;l Martin said &amp;ldquo;this is a very cynical exercise from what I can see&amp;rdquo;, and that the project is effectively about the launch of the Government&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;next election manifesto&amp;rdquo; at the taxpayer&amp;rsquo;s expense.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Noting that his own party believes at least 179 of the Ireland Project 2040 initiatives have already been announced, including &amp;euro;40bn of the &amp;euro;116bn, Mr Martin said &amp;ldquo;there is the element of the political wheeze in this, so you&amp;rsquo;ll forgive me for being a bit cynical&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Martin&amp;rsquo;s view was supported by his party&amp;rsquo;s public expenditure spokesman Dara Calleary, who said high-profile promises such as a second Dublin airport runway and the Metro Link &amp;ldquo;were already included in the previous capital plan&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Finance spokesman Michael McGrath said the promises &amp;ldquo;may be overtaken&amp;rdquo; by economic events over the next two decades.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;While all parties accept there is merit in planning for the future, Sinn F&amp;eacute;in was critical of apparent plan gaps, the party&amp;rsquo;s housing spokesman Eoin &amp;Oacute; Broin and health spokeswoman Louise O&amp;rsquo;Reilly questioning if promises will be delivered on.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Labour leader Brendan Howlin and deputy leader Alan Kelly said the plan is open to potential legal action because the Government&amp;rsquo;s attempt to put it on a statutory footing is taking place before the relevant law is passed by the Oireachtas.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Similarly, party colleague and housing spokeswoman Jan O&amp;rsquo;Sullivan said despite the plan being &amp;ldquo;three years in the making with two sets of public consultation and numerous submissions&amp;rdquo;, the reality is that &amp;ldquo;instead of a coherent plan for the future, we get another cock-up&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said &amp;ldquo;a lot of old projects have been re-hashed and brought forward&amp;rdquo; again by Government for political reasons, noting that controversial changes have been made. &amp;ldquo;The earlier drafts were on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;However, the loosening of restrictions on one-off housing will see up to 60% of future housing development outside villages, towns, and cities. This, without real, tangible plans for public transport, is a recipe for further sprawl and traffic chaos. The last-minute watering-down of proposals to concentrate development could undermine the whole plan.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy expressed doubt over whether the plan involves any real &amp;ldquo;joined-up thinking&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ietopstories/~4/KO13RcnMb5k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n      <category term=\"2.0.0.0\" />\r\n      <category term=\"Ireland\" />\r\n      <contributor>\r\n         <name>IrishExaminer.com</name>\r\n         <email>tcmtext@tcm.ie</email>\r\n         <uri>http://www.irishexaminer.com/</uri>\r\n      </contributor>\r\n      <published>2018-02-17T00:00:00+00:00</published>\r\n   <feedburner:origLink>http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/ireland-2040-repackaging-of-179-projects-a-marketing-ploy-467270.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n   <entry>\r\n      <id>467269</id>\r\n      <title>ESRI warns plan could overheat the economy</title>\r\n      <updated>2018-02-17</updated>\r\n      <author>\r\n         <name>By Eamon Quinn, Business Editor</name>\r\n      </author>\r\n      <link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://feeds.examiner.ie/~r/ietopstories/~3/iElUu6lRZ60/esri-warns-plan-could-overheat-the-economy-467269.html\" />\r\n      <summary type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;A leading think-tank has warned the Government&amp;rsquo;s plans could potentially add too much fuel to the economy and lead to another bust.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>\r\n      <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A leading think-tank has warned the Government&amp;rsquo;s plans could potentially add too much fuel to the economy and lead to another bust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kieran McQuinn, research professor at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), said the additional public funds amounting to &amp;euro;116bn over 10 years come at a time when the economy is already booming.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The ESRI &amp;mdash; whose staff played a significant role in framing the draft of the National Development Plan &amp;mdash; and other watchdogs, including the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the Central Bank, have long warned about the risks of the Government pumping too much into the economy. They say, however, that the economy is not overheating at this time.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Mr McQuinn told the &lt;strong&gt;Irish Examiner&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;that the plan represented a significant amount of money going into the economy which would require economic growth of 3.5% over the next 10 years for it to work. However, he believed the dangers lay more with the potential for overheating that could lead to another crash.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Mr McQuinn said activity was picking up strongly in the home-building and office construction industries.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Edgar Morgenroth, a professor at Dublin City University who helped advise on the framework of the draft while at the ESRI, said the plan relied on boosting large urban centres, including Cork and Dublin, without encouraging sprawl.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cork and Limerick (cities) have the potential to double their size. In other countries, they would be bigger,&amp;rdquo; Mr Morgenroth said, citing the large size of secondary urban centres in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Boosting growth in centres was important but there was evidence that building motorways such as the proposed upgrade of the Cork to Limerick motorway would only encourage sprawl and work against concentrating growth in those cities.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;On the &amp;euro;116bn investment, Mr Morgenroth said that politicians in the past had worked hard on the presentation of development plans.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The aim of the exercise is to make the number look big enough,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Chris van Egeraat, who lectures in economic geography at Maynooth University and was part of an advisory group on the draft of the plan, said &amp;ldquo;the real political game&amp;rdquo; now begins, as regions outside of the big cities pitch to tap some of the resources.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He said he believed in the long-established principle of &amp;ldquo;concentrating&amp;rdquo; growth in a small number of urban centres but had argued for the inclusion of Sligo due to the underperformance of the north-west of the State in terms of economic and population growth.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Dr van Egeraat said the potential of including centres outside of the big centres would mean that the IDA would be encouraged to fight for foreign direct investment (FDI) on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;FDI is important. It will not go to rural areas, only to centres,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ietopstories/~4/iElUu6lRZ60\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n      <category term=\"2.0.0.0\" />\r\n      <category term=\"Ireland\" />\r\n      <contributor>\r\n         <name>IrishExaminer.com</name>\r\n         <email>tcmtext@tcm.ie</email>\r\n         <uri>http://www.irishexaminer.com/</uri>\r\n      </contributor>\r\n      <published>2018-02-17T00:00:00+00:00</published>\r\n   <feedburner:origLink>http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/esri-warns-plan-could-overheat-the-economy-467269.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n   <entry>\r\n      <id>467268</id>\r\n      <title>Ireland 2040: Planners criticise \u2018focus on politics rather than reforms\u2019</title>\r\n      <updated>2018-02-17</updated>\r\n      <author>\r\n         <name>By Fiachra &amp;Oacute; Cionnaith, Irish Examiner Political Correspondent</name>\r\n      </author>\r\n      <link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://feeds.examiner.ie/~r/ietopstories/~3/i8HG7rw2Qy0/ireland-2040-planners-criticise-focus-on-politics-rather-than-reforms-467268.html\" />\r\n      <summary type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Planners have questioned the validity of the Government&amp;rsquo;s Project Ireland 2040 plan, saying while its promises are welcome, it appears to be focussed on politics instead of focussed on reforms.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>\r\n      <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planners have questioned the validity of the Government&amp;rsquo;s Project Ireland 2040 plan, saying while its promises are welcome, it appears to be focussed on politics instead of focussed on reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brendan McCormack, IT Sligo president, and Una Parsons, head of engineering school, IT Sligo, present Leo Varadkar with an Annie West caricature of the Cabinet, as junior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;education minister Mary Michell O&amp;rsquo;Connor, and Sligo-Leitrim TD Tony McLoughlin look on. Picture: James Connolly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Irish Planning Institute made the claim after the publication of the report by Leo Varadkar yesterday, saying the document raises as many questions as it answers.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In a statement responding to the plan alongside more positive responses from Engineers Ireland and regional organisations, the Irish Planning Institute&amp;rsquo;s president Joe Corr said while a two-decade infrastructure strategy was a &amp;ldquo;mature step&amp;rdquo;, there are still serious gaps in the document which must be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Warning the framework is about &amp;ldquo;politics following politics rather than politics following planning&amp;rdquo;, he said for planners, it remains unclear whether the lofty promises will ever be acted upon.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;While the Government&amp;rsquo;s decision to put a framework in place side-by-side with investment is a positive and mature step for our nation, today&amp;rsquo;s announcement raises more questions than gives answers about our ability to learn from our past.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We recognise fully the imperative, and indeed responsibility of public representatives to address citizens concerns.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;From a professional planning perspective, however, Ireland 2040 is not following the evidence as we hoped it would in order to become a robust enabling tool to shape and enable future investment in the growth of our society and its economy.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It presents as a framework for politics following politics rather than politics following planning,&amp;rdquo; Mr Corr said.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Engineers Ireland was more positive saying the plan &amp;ldquo;provides confidence for the engineering sector&amp;rdquo; and is &amp;ldquo;central to enabling prosperity, well-being and long-term growth&amp;rdquo; in all parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A new national regeneration and development agency will be the centre of expertise in strategic land development, and the construction sector working group will ensure dialogue between Government the construction sector,&amp;rdquo; the group&amp;rsquo;s director general Caroline Spillane said.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Both Cork and Dublin&amp;rsquo;s chambers of commerce also welcomed the Government plans, with Cork Chamber&amp;rsquo;s president Bill O&amp;rsquo;Connell particularly hopeful of the changes that have been promised.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Today, we have a historic vote of confidence in Cork&amp;rsquo;s future economic and social significance to Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We have repeatedly emphasised that Cork has the ambition and capacity to develop into a real complementary centre of growth to Dublin.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Today, Government has bought into this vision, with the focus on Cork also aligned in the &amp;euro;116bn national development plan,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;However, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association criticised the document, with its president Pat McCormack saying ultimately the report will be judged by how many of its promises ever come to pass.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The &amp;euro;1bn rural regeneration fund is a real step in the right direction but looked at over a 10-year period, will that sum be sufficient given the massive need for investment in rural areas?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We note too that only half of the fund is specifically dedicated to rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In relation to funding for climate change initiatives, there is a very real opportunity for the Government not only to reduce carbon emissions through renewables but also to develop a vibrant rural-based renewable energy sector based on a family farm and community enterprises that would really boost rural economies rather than the industrial model which will have little if any benefit for rural areas,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is important the plan has at least acknowledged that investment in rural areas has fallen behind and did outline a number of positive initiatives, but judgement will await actual implementation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ietopstories/~4/i8HG7rw2Qy0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n      <category term=\"2.0.0.0\" />\r\n      <category term=\"Ireland\" />\r\n      <contributor>\r\n         <name>IrishExaminer.com</name>\r\n         <email>tcmtext@tcm.ie</email>\r\n         <uri>http://www.irishexaminer.com/</uri>\r\n      </contributor>\r\n      <published>2018-02-17T00:00:00+00:00</published>\r\n   <feedburner:origLink>http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/ireland-2040-planners-criticise-focus-on-politics-rather-than-reforms-467268.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n   <entry>\r\n      <id>467266</id>\r\n      <title>Ireland 2040: Significant developments on the cards for Co Cork</title>\r\n      <updated>2018-02-17</updated>\r\n      <author>\r\n         <name>        Sean O\u2019Riordan    </name>\r\n      </author>\r\n      <link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://feeds.examiner.ie/~r/ietopstories/~3/EfiWOfRUyPM/ireland-2040-significant-developments-on-the-cards-for-co-cork-467266.html\" />\r\n      <summary type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;The gulf in planned development between Cork and Kerry is highlighted by the number of mentions each county gets in both the national development plan (NDP) and the longer term Project Ireland 2040.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>\r\n      <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gulf in planned development between Cork and Kerry is highlighted by the number of mentions each county gets in both the national development plan (NDP) and the longer term Project Ireland 2040.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cork gets 73 mentions in the NDP and 84 in the 2040 plan, while Kerry received 13 and nine respectively.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A planned &amp;euro;200m is to be set aside by the Government to provide new bus corridors, more efficient and reliable bus services and a network of park-and-ride sites in Cork City and its suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The NDP also mentions a new hospital and ambulances bases for Cork but does not provide further specific details.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;euro;900m Cork to Limerick motorway (M20) which was first mooted in 2005, is included in the plan, along with a planned but vital &amp;euro;100m upgrade of the Jack Lynch Tunnel/Dunkettle interchange and the building of the Macroom bypass.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, a plan will be put in place to construct a new road which will link the Jack Lynch Tunnel with the M20, although no timescale was put on that project.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;New relief roads are to be built in Dingle, Co Kerry, and to the west of Carrigaline.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;On the education front, UCC is to get a new business school, additional student accommodation, Innovation Park, ICT services and a new dental school.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Government has also signalled the Tyndall National Institute will be upgraded and expanded to keep it to the &amp;ldquo;forefront of new technologies and build on its successful industry engagement model in sectors such as health and life sciences, ICT, energy and agri-tech&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Part of the &amp;euro;2bn national urban regeneration and development fund, contained in the NDP, will be spent to regenerate the Cork Docklands and Tivoli.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The NDP commits to the development of the Sl&amp;iacute;

and prepare for the future following a special Cabinet meeting at the Institute of Technology in Sligo.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Project Ireland 2040 will invest in infrastructure, housing, health and the environment over the next two decades.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It includes a &amp;euro;2bn urban regeneration and development fund, &amp;euro;1bn rural development fund, and &amp;euro;500m climate action fund.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Taoiseach Leo Varadkar described the framework as a &amp;ldquo;significant milestone in our country&amp;rsquo;s development&amp;rdquo; adding that it marks &amp;ldquo;the point at which we put a lost decade behind us and move forward into a new decade of expansion&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We have the plan, we have the money, now we need to move to implement it. This is a plan for all our citizens &amp;mdash; the old, the young, and the yet to be born, living in towns, in cities and in the countryside,&amp;rdquo; he noted.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Elective only-hospitals will be built in Cork, Dublin and Galway while Government has also committed to 2,600 extra acute hospital beds under the Project Ireland 2040 framework.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;House building will increase to 25,000 homes a year by 2020, rising to up to 35,000 by 2027. Social housing will be provided for 112,000 families in the next decade in a bid to address the housing crisis.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A total of &amp;euro;7.3bn has been earmarked for regional road accessibility investing in national roads across Ireland, plus &amp;euro;4.5bn for regional and local, improving links to the north-west and across the country.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A new runway will be built at Dublin Airport, and there will be investment in Cork and Shannon airports.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A significant number of measures around protecting the environment form part of the plan with &amp;euro;22bn allocated to deliver on climate action investment.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;From 2021, some 45,000 homes will be retrofitted per year to become more energy efficient &amp;mdash; up from 30,000 per year.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;All public buildings will be energy efficient by 2030 while no more diesel-only buses will be bought for public transport services after mid-2019.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;However, the Taoiseach said that the plan on its own won&amp;rsquo;t allow the country to meet the EU&amp;rsquo;s 2030 climate and energy targets: &amp;ldquo;It will get us a good chunk of the way, we estimate that this plan will get us between 30% and 40% of the way. Other measures are needed too, so you will see some of them already in national mitigation plan, but we will have to look at other things as well, for example, carbon taxation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Taoiseach strongly refuted a claim made by Fianna F&amp;aacute;il leader Miche&amp;aacute;l Martin who said the plan amounts to an election manifesto: &amp;ldquo;I imagine over the next 10 or 20 years there will be many elections, so this is a long-term plan, not an election manifesto.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He said there had been &amp;ldquo;detailed consultation&amp;rdquo; in the lead-up to the planning framework which has been worked on for three years: &amp;ldquo;I encourage the political parties to come behind it and to say that they support it and they endorse it and if they can&amp;rsquo;t I encourage them to say in detail what they would do differently.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So if there is a new project they would like to add I would like to know which one would like to remove. If there is a project they wish to accelerate, I would like to know which one they are going to slow down, but I do encourage them in the first instance to support it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Transport infrastructure: More than &amp;euro;10bn to be spent on road network&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conall &amp;Oacute; F&amp;aacute;tharta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=\"520\" src=\"https://media.central.ie/media/images/c/CarsOnABusyMotorway010118_large.jpg?s=\"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Government hopes to spend &amp;euro;5.7bn on national road schemes and &amp;euro;4.5bn on improving regional and local roads in the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The details are contained in the national development plan (NDP), which intends to improve the road linkages between Dublin and most of the other urban areas and regions, particularly in the North-West.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The NDP claims &amp;ldquo;substantial progress&amp;rdquo; has been made, since 2000, in improving road linkages, but it is hoped that &amp;ldquo;every region, and all the major urban areas, particularly those in the North-West, which have been comparatively neglected until recently, are linked to Dublin by a high-quality road network&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Another key priority is the Atlantic Corridor and a high-quality road network linking Cork, Limerick, Galway, and Sligo.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The NDP also provides investment for development of the border region, including: the N2/A5 road serving Meath, Monaghan and Donegal; the N14 Manorcunningham to Lifford; the N52 Ardee Bypass; the N2 Slane Bypass; the N4 Collooney to Castlebaldwin; the N5 Westport to Turlough, and Ballaghdereen to Scramogue; the N56 Dungloe to Glenties and Mountcharles to Inver.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Government is also &amp;ldquo;committed to participation in the further development&amp;rdquo; of the A5.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The following sections of the national road network should undergo early planning this year:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;N2 Clontibret to the border; N2 Rath roundabout to Kilmoon Cross; N2 Ardee to south of Castleblaney; N3 Virginia bypass; M4 Maynooth to Leixlip; N4 Mullingar to Longford; N4 Carrick on Shannon; M11 from Jn 4 M50 to Kilmacanogue; N11 Oilgate to Rosslare; N13 Ballybofey Stranorlar bypass; N13/N14/N56 Letterkenny bypass and dual carriageway to Manorcunningham; N14 Manorcunningham to Lifford; N17 Knock to Collooney; N21 Newcastle West bypass; N21 Abbeyfeale; N24 Cahir to Limerick Junction; N24 Waterford to Cahir; N25 Waterford to Glenmore; N25 Carrigtwohill to Midleton; N52 Tullamore to Kilbeggan; N3 Clonee to M50; M50 Dublin Port south access.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The following regional and local roads will be improved by the national development plan:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;the Sallins bypass; Adamstown and Nangor road improvements; Portlaoise southern distributor road; Shannon Crossing; Laytown to Bettystown link road; Garavogue bridge scheme; Dingle relief road; Athy southern distributor road; Sligo western distributor road; Coonagh to Knockalisheen main contract; Realignment of R498 Nenagh/Thurles road at Latteragh; Killaloe bypass/R494 upgrade and Carrigaline western distributor road.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Routes to Ireland&amp;rsquo;s ports will be upgraded, such as the M11, improving connectivity to Rosslare; the N28 Cork to Ringaskiddy Road, improving access to the Port of Cork; N21/N69 Limerick to Adare to Foynes Road, improving access to Shannon Foynes Port.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A study of high-speed rail between Dublin-Belfast, Dublin-Limerick Junction/Cork and an evaluation of its economic benefits, against improvements to existing-line speeds, will be carried out within the year. A total of &amp;euro;2bn is to be provided to Irish Rail for the expansion of the Dart services while &amp;euro;2.4bn is to be put into the Bus Connects programme.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Climate change: &amp;euro;22bn plan prioritises greener homes, transport&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caroline O&amp;rsquo;Doherty &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class='imgFCap'&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://media.central.ie/media/images/c/CastlepookWindFarm_large.jpg\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class='imgFCap'&gt;Wind energy is a priority but funding will be available to pursue projects in wave, solar, biomass and hydrogen.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Some &amp;euro;22bn worth of investment in technology and other initiatives is aimed at reducing carbon emissions even while population growth increases carbon- producing activities through extra demand on energy, transport, and industrial output.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Exchequer spending will run to &amp;euro;7.6bn while private investment is expected to account for &amp;euro;14.2bn. A &amp;euro;500m climate action fund is to be set up to kickstart investment, financed by an existing 2c per litre levy on petrol.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Other expenditure will include &amp;euro;4bn in funding to upgrading 40,000 homes per year from 2021 to achieve a minimum B BER. A B rating will also be targeted for all public buildings and a third of commercial premises, and supports are to be put in place to switch 170,000 homes from oil-fired boilers to heat pumps and rooftop solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Much of what is mentioned is already in the national mitigation plan, such as the aim for 500,000 electric vehicles to be on the road by 2030 with a parallel expansion of the public charging network.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After 2030, all new cars will have to be zero emission and, after 2045, no NCT cert will be issued for non-zero emission cars. A ban on buying diesel buses will come into effect next year.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Major investment in public transport infrastructure such as extra bus routes and expansion of the Luas, Dart and Metrolink &amp;mdash; costed elsewhere in the plan &amp;mdash; is also included.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Power for homes and industry is also in focus with the use of coal at ESB&amp;rsquo;s Moneypoint station to end by 2025 at a potential cost of &amp;euro;1bn. Peat-powered stations are to be phased out by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Investments in the electricity and gas networks will boost their capacity to serve a bigger population, enable them carry renewable and strengthen connections with France and the UK. Wind energy is a priority but funding will be available to pursue projects in wave, solar, biomass and hydrogen.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;District heating schemes will be supported as will pilot projects in a number of rural towns where food and agricultural waste will be converted to gas for local use. Increased investment in forestry is planned.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure is to be strengthened to handle the effects of climate change with improved road drainage, stronger bridges and the raising of some roads. There is also restated commitment to the &amp;euro;940m in flood risk management plans already set out for 29 riverside and coastal communities.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Housing: New agency could claim land through CPOs&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joe Leogue &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class='imgFCap'&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://media.central.ie/media/images/h/housebuildingconstructiongeneric17_large.jpg\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class='imgFCap'&gt;More than 500,000 new homes are needed to meet the expected population growth between now and 2040.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Project Ireland 2040 proposes the establishment of an urban regeneration agency that will have the power to claim land through compulsory purchase orders if it feels the sites in question &amp;ldquo;are not being utilised to their full potential&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The establishment of the body - called the National Regeneration and Development Agency forms part of the Government&amp;rsquo;s &amp;euro;2bn urban regeneration fund. A &amp;euro;1bn fund for rural development also forms part of the plan.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;More than 500,000 new homes are needed to meet the expected population growth between now and 2040, according to the plan, and it indicates the Government&amp;rsquo;s intention to focus housing development in concentrated areas, &amp;ldquo;at locations that can support sustainable development&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Some 45,000 homes are needed in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, and Waterford in the next two years, and up to 35,000 homes per year are needed nationwide between now and 2027.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The plan says the Government will adopt a major new policy emphasis on renewing and developing existing settlements, rather than seeing a continuation of a development sprawl of cities and towns out into the countryside.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The target is for at least 40% of all new housing to be delivered within the existing built-up areas of cities, towns and villages on infill and/or brownfield sites. The rest of our homes will continue to be delivered at the edge of settlements and in rural areas,&amp;rdquo; it says.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It will do this, it claims, by increasing residential density &amp;ldquo;through a range of measures including reductions in vacancy, re-use of existing buildings, infill development schemes, area or site-based regeneration and increased building heights&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It says the existing pattern of development is unsustainable because it forces people to commute greater distances between their places of work and services. The plan aims to tackle this by concentrating development within existing urban areas, with &amp;ldquo;a particular focus on brownfield development, targeting derelict and vacant sites that may have been developed before but have fallen into disuse&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As part of this, the National Regeneration and Development Agency will work with public bodies &amp;ldquo;to co-ordinate and secure the best use of public lands, investment required within the capital envelopes provided in the National Development Plan and to drive the renewal of strategic areas not being utilised to their full potential&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Government will consider how best to make State lands available to such a body to kick-start its development role and to legislate for enhanced compulsory purchase powers to ensure that the necessary transformation of the places most in need of regeneration can take place more swiftly and effectively,&amp;rdquo; the plan states.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There will also be greater emphasis on the development of apartments, building &amp;ldquo;inwards and upwards, rather than outwards&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Education: Capital spending to top &amp;euro;1bn a year&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Niall Murray &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class='imgFCap'&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://media.central.ie/media/images/r/RichardBrutonPresser100716_large.jpg\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class='imgFCap'&gt;Education Minister Richard Bruton&amp;rsquo;s department has a &amp;euro;4.7bn capital budget up to 2022&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Building and other capital spending on education will exceed &amp;euro;1bn a year by 2021 under the National Development Plan.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Many elements of the education plans included in the 2018-2027 plan have previously been announced and some building elements will just barely exceed current delivery rates.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;From a &amp;euro;745m allocation this year, the Department of Education&amp;rsquo;s capital budget will jump to over &amp;euro;940m in each of the next two years. It will then rise to &amp;euro;1.06bn and &amp;euro;1.1bn in 2021 and 2022, respectively, bringing total investment over the plan&amp;rsquo;s first five years to over &amp;euro;4.7bn.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The plan is to deliver 20,0000 permanent school places a year through the department&amp;rsquo;s school building programme, which will be just 1,000 more per year than were delivered in 2017. They will be a mix of additional places for existing schools and the construction of new schools in areas of significant population growth, with up to 50 large-scale projects a year expected to be completed, around the same as last year.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The focus of school building will move from primary to second-level, where enrolments are not expected to peak until 2025.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;euro;100m annual allocation by the early 2020s is planned for maintenance and minor works grants, which should be welcomed by schools given the lack of certainty around these schemes in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Over the longer 10-year term of the NDP, &amp;euro;2.2bn from taxpayers is being committed in support of infrastructure priorities in universities, institutes of technology and other publicly-funded colleges.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As previously announced by Mr Bruton and Minister of State for Higher Education Mary Mitchell O&amp;rsquo;Connor last October, this will include 11 public-private partnership projects to develop facilities at institutes of technology.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Irish Universities&amp;rsquo; Association said the extra capital funding opens the way for urgent upgrades to many outdated facilities, and to expand buildings needed to cater for an anticipated growth by 40,000 students up to 2030. But, it said, the investment needs to be matched with a &amp;lsquo;long-overdue&amp;rdquo; overhaul of the operational funding model for higher education to provide human capital, referring to the lack of political progress on the 2016 Cassells report recommending the sector needs an extra &amp;euro;600m of non-capital funding a year by 2020 and &amp;euro;1bn more annually by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Healthcare: 2,600 extra hospital beds promised&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catherine Shanahan &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class='imgFCap'&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://media.central.ie/media/images/h/HospitalTrolleyBeingPushedInCorridor130117_large.jpg\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class='imgFCap'&gt;A new acute hospital is planned for Cork, along with elective hospitals in Cork, Galway, and Dublin.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Almost &amp;euro;11bn has been earmarked for developments in the health service over the next decade including 2,600 extra hospital beds, 4,500 additional public nursing home beds and two new hospitals for Cork.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Money will also be provided for development of the paediatric unit at Cork University Hospital. Phase 1 was completed last year at a cost of &amp;euro;13m. The second phase is estimated to cost &amp;euro;17m. Cork has also been earmarked for a new ambulance base, in addition to Limerick and Galway.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The national development plan contains no timeline or location is given for the proposed acute hospital in Cork. In relation to the elective hospitals &amp;mdash; one each for Cork, Galway and Dublin &amp;mdash; the plan says they will provide &amp;ldquo;high volume, low complexity procedures on a day and outpatient basis&amp;rdquo;, adjacent to general hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Several projects, previously announced, are in the plan including the National Children&amp;rsquo;s Hospital, the New Forensic Mental Health Service Hospital in Dublin, and phase 1 redevelopment of the National Rehabilitation Hospital at D&amp;uacute;n Laoghaire. However phase 2 is also in the plan which would see the refurbishment of the existing hospital building, in addition to the new 120-bed adjacent hospital under construction as part of phase 1.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The national programme for radiation oncology will receive funding for replacement and additional facilities and equipment at public hospitals in Dublin, Cork and Galway.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Construction is already under way in Cork to provide replacement and additional radiation oncology facilities which will be commissioned in 2020. There are also plans for the construction of a &amp;ldquo;comprehensive cancer centre&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Fianna F&amp;aacute;il health spokesman Billy Kelleher said the Government &amp;ldquo;can promise the sun, the moon and the stars in terms of extra spending and extra capital projects, but unless patients see actual, real time reductions in terms of their waits for accessing basic yet important treatments, it will be a failure&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Irish Hospital Consultants&amp;rsquo; Association said it welcomed the commitment to invest, but IHCA president Tom Ryan said it was &amp;ldquo;vitally important that an annual commissioning plan is agreed to put the additional 2,600 acute beds in place much earlier than the 10-year period proposed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Irish Cancer Society said development of a comprehensive cancer centre &amp;ldquo;needs to happen to move Ireland towards world-class cancer services&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Regional balance: Rural allocation done on a 2:1 ratio&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Noel Baker &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class='imgFCap'&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://media.central.ie/media/images/w/WalkingFarmlandNov15_large.jpg\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class='imgFCap'&gt;The framework&amp;rsquo;s definition of &amp;lsquo;rural&amp;rsquo; includes settlements with populations between 1,500 and 10,000.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new NDP points out that 37% of the population currently live in rural areas, which might suggest a 3:1 urban/rural spend.

The national broadband plan is also mentioned &amp;mdash; estimated cost &amp;ldquo;confidential&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Road projects include the Carrigaline Western Distributor Road with local authorities also pushing for a Carlow Southern Relief Road and Tralee Northern Relief Road. There is capital investment for public transport in rural areas, but the &amp;ldquo;main emphasis&amp;rdquo; is on public service obligation routes and the Local Link Programme. &amp;ldquo;Subject to availability of operational funding&amp;rdquo; new town bus services will be provided in certain large towns, and ultimately to Carlow, Kilkenny, Mullingar, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Securing regional balance is the fundamental purpose of the NPF&amp;rdquo;, to be underpinned by the &amp;euro;1bn rural regeneration and development fund that includes rural brownfield development, with initial funding of &amp;euro;315m from 2019 to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Funding sources such as the LEADER Programme will continue, while the rural regeneration and development fund will integrate some existing schemes.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;New Technology and Innovation Poles (TIPs) will also be developed through EI and the Industrial Development Authority (IDA) to drive regional and rural development.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The NDP refers to &amp;ldquo;town-scale pilots of food and agricultural waste to gas in agricultural catchments for local gas networks supply and biogas production&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;piloting of &amp;lsquo;climate-smart countryside&amp;rsquo; projects to establish the feasibility of the home and farm becoming net exporters of electricity&amp;rdquo;, citing solar, heat-pumps and wind.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Technologies: &amp;euro;9.4bn for business and innovation&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P&amp;aacute;draig Hoare &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class='imgFCap'&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://media.central.ie/media/images/l/LargeHadronColliderExam040615_large.jpg\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class='imgFCap'&gt;Part of the Large Hadron Collider at Cern.

he said.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The IDA regional assistance comes as rural towns around the country say they have been left out when it comes to foreign direct investment in favour of cities like Dublin and Cork.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The plan was criticised for simply reiterating projects that have already been committed to, such as the &amp;euro;300m Brexit loan scheme for businesses announced in the budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ietopstories/~4/mdzWzV-KsD0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n      <category term=\"2.0.0.0\" />\r\n      <category term=\"Ireland\" />\r\n      <contributor>\r\n         <name>IrishExaminer.com</name>\r\n         <email>tcmtext@tcm.ie</email>\r\n         <uri>http://www.irishexaminer.com/</uri>\r\n      </contributor>\r\n      <published>2018-02-17T00:00:00+00:00</published>\r\n   <feedburner:origLink>http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/ireland-2040-promise-to-restart-projects-stalled-in-downturn-467264.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n   <entry>\r\n      <id>467262</id>\r\n      <title>WATCH: Waiting for Sheeran as video star Joe celebrates in style</title>\r\n      <updated>2018-02-17</updated>\r\n      <author>\r\n         <name>        Pet O\u2019Connell    </name>\r\n      </author>\r\n      <link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://feeds.examiner.ie/~r/ietopstories/~3/8Q1McHBXNcU/watch-waiting-for-sheeran-as-video-star-joe-celebrates-in-style-467262.html\" />\r\n      <summary type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s still waiting for his birthday card from Ed Sheeran to arrive, but sheep farmer-turned-internet sensation Joe Kelly did not let that stop the party as he marked his 80th in style with a community celebration.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>\r\n      <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s still waiting for his birthday card from Ed Sheeran to arrive, but sheep farmer-turned-internet sensation Joe Kelly did not let that stop the party as he marked his 80th in style with a community celebration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe found international fame as one of three men captured on video by &lt;strong&gt;Irish Examiner&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;photographer Dan Linehan as they celebrated the reopening of their local pub the Top of Coom, between Kilgarvan and C&amp;uacute;il Aodha, following its destruction in a 2012 fire.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Nearly 700,000 people have watched the YouTube video of Joe in the bar feeding a lamb from a bottle as he, Dan Kelleher, and Johnny McCarthy raised a glass to the end of a two-year drought without a pub in the mountainous area on the Cork-Kerry border.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://landmark.bbvms.com/p/ie_default_ads/c/2516485.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The video, which had viewers around the world trying to decipher the trio&amp;rsquo;s dialect, also caught the eye of superstar Ed Sheeran, who described it as &amp;ldquo;amazing&amp;rdquo; during an interview with Ryan Tubridy on RT&amp;Eacute;&amp;rsquo;s Late Late Show.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;An invitation was duly issued by owners Tim and Eileen Creedon for Sheeran to visit the Top of Coom.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;And if the singer-songwriter should decide to drop in for a quiet pint when he&amp;rsquo;s in Cork for his sell-out P&amp;aacute;irc U&amp;iacute;

We used to have to cross the mountain. C&amp;uacute;il Aodha&amp;rsquo;s on the other side of the mountain from us in Doire &amp;rsquo;n Chuilinn,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There were no cars that time.

It was a reunion more than anything,&amp;rdquo; said Joe, &amp;ldquo;Some of the kids are 50 and 60 now though,&amp;rdquo; he laughed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It was his marriage to Joan, daughter of &amp;lsquo;An Poc ar Buile&amp;rsquo; composer D&amp;oacute;nal &amp;Oacute; Mull&amp;aacute;in, that brought Joe home from a stint working in England. A poet herself, Joan composed among other works the prayer &amp;lsquo;Gobnait &amp;Aacute;rsa&amp;rsquo;, set to music by Peadar &amp;Oacute; Riada and sung regularly in C&amp;uacute;il Aodha church.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The couple lived on the family farm, where Joe still helps out with the keeping of around 300 sheep, but always ensures there&amp;rsquo;s time for a song or a dance.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I was dancing jigs at the party,&amp;rdquo; he said &amp;ldquo;and I&amp;rsquo;m going to the Top of Coom now in a fortnight&amp;rsquo;s time, dancing a jig with the Luceys Screathan, and they&amp;rsquo;re recording it for the television, for TG4.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ietopstories/~4/8Q1McHBXNcU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n      <category term=\"2.0.0.0\" />\r\n      <category term=\"Ireland\" />\r\n      <contributor>\r\n         <name>IrishExaminer.com</name>\r\n         <email>tcmtext@tcm.ie</email>\r\n         <uri>http://www.irishexaminer.com/</uri>\r\n      </contributor>\r\n      <published>2018-02-17T00:00:00+00:00</published>\r\n   <feedburner:origLink>http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/watch-waiting-for-sheeran-as-video-star-joe-celebrates-in-style-467262.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n   <entry>\r\n      <id>467260</id>\r\n      <title>Moth thought extinct found by amateur lepidopterist</title>\r\n      <updated>2018-02-17</updated>\r\n      <author>\r\n         <name>By Evelyn Ring, Irish Examiner Reporter</name>\r\n      </author>\r\n      <link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://feeds.examiner.ie/~r/ietopstories/~3/Kj1wmTfti0s/moth-thought-extinct-found-by-amateur-lepidopterist-467260.html\" />\r\n      <summary type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Moths might not look spectacular, but amateur lepidopterist, Philip Strickland, knew it was a rare find.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>\r\n      <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moths might not look spectacular, but amateur lepidopterist, Philip Strickland, knew it was a rare find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Called The Suspected &lt;strong&gt;&amp;mdash; Parastichtis suspecta&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;it was thought to be extinct in Ireland. It was last spotted in 1962.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Strickland found eight of the brown moths in Lullymore Heritage and Discovery Park, in Rathangan Co Kildare, last July, indicating that they were very happy there.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The species inhabits woodland and heathland, and the larvae feed on birch and willow. They are on the wing in late July and August.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It is not known why the moth almost became extinct, but it is believed deforestation and peat-extraction destroyed their natural habitat.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The manager of Lullymore Heritage and Discovery Park, Ray Stapleton, said the park had been used by Bord na M&amp;oacute;na for decades to extract peat and once resembled a black desert.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Since 2011, we have been trying to prove that these cutaways are not wastelands, but, potentially, very biodiverse habitats that will also attract tourism to an area that traditionally never had it,&amp;rdquo; said Mr Stapleton.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The potential for numerous species to thrive in such a diverse habitat is great, as we have seen through Philip&amp;rsquo;s work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As well as moths, the park is now home to red squirrels, pine martens, hares, lapwings, buzzards, newts, frogs, and butterflies.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Stapleton said a former &lt;strong&gt;Irish Examiner&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;columnist, the late Dick Warner, spent many years helping the park to develop the peatland biodiversity area.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It may take a while to happen, but I firmly believe that this is a win-win situation, as our peatlands biodiversity area is really beneficial to the environment and is key to us attracting tourism from all over the world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Strickland said there were about five records of The Suspected from five different sites in Ireland, but the last time it was seen was 56 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He uses a moth trap that has an ultraviolet light and empty egg cartons. The moths are attracted to the light, make contact with the plastic veins, and drop down into the trap.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The moths sit happily in the egg cartons, until I release them unharmed, the next morning, into the vegetation nearby,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have been studying moths for more than 20 years, but I do have a desk job.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I would describe myself as an amateur lepidopterist.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The name &amp;lsquo;lepidopterist&amp;rsquo; is derived from the name of the order of butterflies and moths, Lepidoptera.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Strickland is a member of Moths Ireland, a group of amateurs and professionals.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;They collect and collate records for the National Biodiversity Data Centre in Carriganore, Co Waterford.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The data centre is funded by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Heritage Council.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Strickland is planning to continue examining moth species in Lullymore Heritage and Discovery Park this year.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He recorded 201 species there last year.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The site is proving to be of national significance, with the recording of a considerable number of rare and scarce species,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The site is really doing well, as it has a great mix of habitat. The Scots pine and birch woodland, with the undergrowth of bilberry, is a really important native habitat and is producing great records.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ietopstories/~4/Kj1wmTfti0s\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n      <category term=\"2.0.0.0\" />\r\n      <category term=\"Ireland\" />\r\n      <contributor>\r\n         <name>IrishExaminer.com</name>\r\n         <email>tcmtext@tcm.ie</email>\r\n         <uri>http://www.irishexaminer.com/</uri>\r\n      </contributor>\r\n      <published>2018-02-17T00:00:00+00:00</published>\r\n   <feedburner:origLink>http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/moth-thought-extinct-found-by-amateur-lepidopterist-467260.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n   <entry>\r\n      <id>467259</id>\r\n      <title>Man who tried to flee court is sent forward for trial</title>\r\n      <updated>2018-02-17</updated>\r\n      <author>\r\n         <name />\r\n      </author>\r\n      <link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://feeds.examiner.ie/~r/ietopstories/~3/vyvp_AQKuHQ/man-who-tried-to-flee-court-is-sent-forward-for-trial-467259.html\" />\r\n      <summary type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;A man has been sent forward for trial, on a plea of guilty, for trying to escape garda custody in a courthouse, and on a charge of assault, relating to the same incident.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>\r\n      <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man has been sent forward for trial, on a plea of guilty, for trying to escape garda custody in a courthouse, and on a charge of assault, relating to the same incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James McCarney, 40, had previously appeared in the district court on February 7, in relation to charges of dangerous driving and of having no insurance at a garda checkpoint the previous day.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;At that court appearance, he was refused bail and then appeared to try and flee the courtroom. He was tackled by a number of garda&amp;iacute;, one of whom was injured.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;That led to a subsequent court appearance, a week ago, in Bandon District Court. There, Mr McCarney, who has given an address at Balmore, Torrance, in Glasgow, and also at Rossmore, Clonakilty, in Co Cork, was charged with assault and resisting a garda in the execution of his duty, at Macroom District Court, on February 7, and with attempting to escape from garda custody, at the court on the same date.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Insp Pat Meany said, yesterday, that the Director of Public Prosecutions had directed the charges of dangerous driving and no insurance be dealt with at district court level, but that the two charges arising out of the incident at Macroom, on February 7, be sent forward to the Cork Circuit Criminal Court.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The previous court sitting involving Mr McCarney, a businessman, had heard that he had apologised for his actions and would be pleading guilty to the charges.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Bandon District Court heard, yesterday, that the DPP also consented to Mr McCarney being sent forward to the Cork Circuit Criminal Court on a signed plea &amp;mdash; something which would speed up the trial process, as it would not require a book of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Mr McCarney&amp;rsquo;s solicitor, Eamonn Fleming, said his client had already indicated a plea of guilty in relation to the dangerous-driving charge from the checkpoint at Tooreen, Ballinhassig, on February 6.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;However, he said he was not in a position to advise as to the no-insurance charge faced by his client, as he had not seen an insurance policy, and documents had not been forthcoming.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He also applied, again, for his client to be released on bail, but Judge Mary Dorgan said she had already dealt with this. &amp;ldquo;I am going to recuse myself from dealing with this matter,&amp;rdquo; she said, and that the alleged incident on February 7 had happened in her court and that it was &amp;ldquo;important for justice to be done and for justice to be seen to be done&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;She said she had organised for another judge to hear the district court matters, next Thursday, but Mr Fleming said he could not say whether he would have received all the information he required, so as to enter a plea, by then. Those matters will be mentioned on March 2, while Mr McCarney will be sent forward for trial, possibly as early as next week, in the Circuit Criminal Court, regarding the February 7 incident.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Fleming said this would happen on a signed plea of guilty and added: &amp;ldquo;The matter can be dealt with more promptly in the circuit court.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ietopstories/~4/vyvp_AQKuHQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n      <category term=\"2.0.0.0\" />\r\n      <category term=\"Ireland\" />\r\n      <contributor>\r\n         <name>IrishExaminer.com</name>\r\n         <email>tcmtext@tcm.ie</email>\r\n         <uri>http://www.irishexaminer.com/</uri>\r\n      </contributor>\r\n      <published>2018-02-17T00:00:00+00:00</published>\r\n   <feedburner:origLink>http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/man-who-tried-to-flee-court-is-sent-forward-for-trial-467259.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n   <entry>\r\n      <id>467253</id>\r\n      <title>G-section: How a Cork-born doctor delivered a baby gorilla by caesarean</title>\r\n      <updated>2018-02-17</updated>\r\n      <author>\r\n         <name>By Catherine Shanahan, Health Correspondent</name>\r\n      </author>\r\n      <link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://feeds.examiner.ie/~r/ietopstories/~3/mcVC1kzfApg/g-section-how-a-cork-born-doctor-delivered-a-baby-gorilla-by-caesarean-467253.html\" />\r\n      <summary type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Not many men can claim to have helped impregnate a gorilla or to have delivered a primate by caesarean section, but David Cahill&amp;rsquo;s CV is fairly unique, even in the radical world of fertility medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>\r\n      <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not many men can claim to have helped impregnate a gorilla or to have delivered a primate by caesarean section, but David Cahill&amp;rsquo;s CV is fairly unique, even in the radical world of fertility medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, so bizarre, particularly as David&amp;rsquo;s background is one of delivering human babies and treating human couples for fertility problems.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A consultant obstetrician/gynaecologist, originally from Donoughmore, Co Cork, David&amp;rsquo;s involvement with the largest living primates goes back over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He studied medicine in University College Cork (UCC) and subsequently worked in the National Maternity Hospital in Dublin where he developed an interest in reproductive medicine, prompted by contact with Colm O&amp;rsquo;Herlihy, now Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at University College Dublin (UCD) School of Medicine and Medical Science.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;David subsequently went to Bristol in the 1990s to study and &amp;ldquo;never left&amp;rdquo;. He is now Professor in Reproductive Medicine and Medical Education at Bristol University. His day job takes him to St Michael&amp;rsquo;s University Hospital where his focus is on gynaecology, specifically fertility treatment.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;His day job has also taken him to Bristol Zoo where he was centrally involved in an event which caught the public imagination: the delivery by C-section of a baby gorilla on account of concerns that its mother had pre-eclampsia. On February 10, that baby, named Afia, celebrated her second birthday.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So how does a doctor segue from babies to great apes?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Vets don&amp;rsquo;t do IVF,&amp;rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;David&amp;rsquo;s involvement with Bristol Zoo goes back to 2004/2005 when the zoo&amp;rsquo;s efforts to get a gorilla pregnant were unsuccessful. Thinking outside the box, the zoo made contact with David because of his background in reproductive medicine.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They knew I knew how to get people pregnant so they asked if I could help,&amp;rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It was a bit of a challenge.&amp;rdquo; It was &amp;ldquo;practically impossible&amp;rdquo; to do blood tests to measure the gorilla&amp;rsquo;s hormones, (try approaching a moody gorilla with a syringe) so they had to depend on urine samples. David still has deep sympathy for the zookeeper whose task it was to retrieve urine samples every day for three months.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The enclosure was well-designed so that everything flowed into a hole in the middle and he was able to retrieve urine from that point,&amp;rdquo; David says. The samples were sent to a German laboratory for analysis. It emerged the gorilla, Salome, was not ovulating.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So we gave her tablets to get her to ovulate, mixed in with her food, and she got pregnant,&amp;rdquo; David says. She gave birth to a son, Komale.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class='imgFCap'&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://media.central.ie/media/images/s/SurgeryForGorillaInBristolZoo160218a_large.jpg\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class='imgFCap'&gt;Afia enjoying her birthday celebrations, with surrogate mother Romina. It is expected Afia will remain with her until she is five.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Having proved his usefulness, David was recalled two years ago when Kera the gorilla showed signs of pre-eclampsia while carrying Komale&amp;rsquo;s child. David estimates she was &amp;ldquo;38-39 weeks pregnant, but I can&amp;rsquo;t be certain, apes don&amp;rsquo;t have a last period and you can&amp;rsquo;t ask them&amp;rdquo;. He says the zoo was concerned about Kera and they got in touch with him on a Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We planned to go and scan the mother on the Friday. There was a chance we might end up delivering the baby. But when I scanned her, it looked like the baby was really in trouble,&amp;rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The vets subsequently gave David the go-ahead to deliver, and Kera was taken by stretcher to a van and then to the vets&amp;rsquo; working area. She was shaved, David put iodine on her tummy and donned sterile drapes.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So how different was it to delivering a human child?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The whole thing was very strange and very weird. It was a very different environment and the smells were different. Kera vomited before the operation, a smelly green mess. And there were so many photographs being taken.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It felt like it went on forever but my junior colleague (another doctor from St Michael&amp;rsquo;s) said it only took three-quarters of an hour.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Was there a fear Kera would wake up during the operation?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I was anxious. The zoo-keepers were holding her arms and feet and occasionally one would say &amp;lsquo;she&amp;rsquo;s twitching&amp;rsquo;. She&amp;rsquo;d clobber me if she woke up and saw the knife,&amp;rdquo; he says, laughing.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The surgery was trickier than a human delivery because of the different shape of the pelvis and uterus, but he managed it with minimal damage. The upshot was the birth of baby Afia, Ugandan for &amp;ldquo;born on a Friday&amp;rdquo;, and membership of an exclusive club of consultant obstetricians/gynaecologists to perform c-sections on gorillas.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There are reports of 12-15 c-sections worldwide,&amp;rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He is thankful he didn&amp;rsquo;t have to remove Kera&amp;rsquo;s stitches: &amp;ldquo;We thought about that &amp;mdash; and put in subcuticular stitches &amp;mdash; ones that are under the skin, and dissolve by themselves.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He did undertake follow-up visits, but Kera was in a &amp;lsquo;bad place&amp;rsquo; for nine months after the birth. In retrospect, David and the vets believe she may have been suffering from kidney disease, not pre-eclampsia. She was subsequently treated with steroids and recovered.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He did visit Afia once a week for a couple of weeks after the birth, and she was doing well. And he has since taken his two-year-old granddaughter to see Afia but hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet told her of his role in her existence.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class='imgFCap'&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://media.central.ie/media/images/s/SurgeryForGorillaInBristolZoo160218b_large.jpg\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class='imgFCap'&gt;The baby western lowland gorilla Afia, who celebrated her second birthday last Monday.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, his brothers at home in Ireland, Paul, Declan and Kieran, and his Dad, Pat, are dining out on David&amp;rsquo;s walk into the gorilla hall of fame.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As for David?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I really didn&amp;rsquo;t realise at the time that it was going to be such a big fuss, I was just doing the thing that I do. But in hindsight, it&amp;rsquo;s brought me into contact with a fairly small and fairly unique, global community of people dedicated to conservation of gorillas. It makes me feel part of that community. There are only 300 gorillas or so in captivity worldwide, so in that sense, what we did was a very big deal.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ietopstories/~4/mcVC1kzfApg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>\r\n      <category term=\"2.0.0.0\" />\r\n      <category term=\"Ireland\" />\r\n      <contributor>\r\n         <name>IrishExaminer.com</name>\r\n         <email>tcmtext@tcm.ie</email>\r\n         <uri>http://www.irishexaminer.com/</uri>\r\n      </contributor>\r\n      <published>2018-02-17T00:00:00+00:00</published>\r\n   <feedburner:origLink>http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/g-section-how-a-cork-born-doctor-delivered-a-baby-gorilla-by-caesarean-467253.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>\r\n</feed>\r\n",
