This year, live casinos really bumped up on the popularity scale, and thanks to improvements in internet connections, display devices, and high-def cameras, developers can create games where you get to interact with croupiers and dealers in real time.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2325\" src=\"https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/event_technology.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"524\" srcset=\"https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/event_technology.jpg 800w, https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/event_technology-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/event_technology-768x503.jpg 768w, https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/event_technology-641x420.jpg 641w, https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/event_technology-640x419.jpg 640w, https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/event_technology-681x446.jpg 681w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>With the speed at which technology improves, game developers are enjoying more and more freedom to turn their inspirations into thrilling and immersive games.</p>\n<p>In 2018, we are set to see online casino software developers focusing more on virtual reality. You\u2019ve probably heard of VR already but now; three-dimensional environments will allow online casino gamers to pull the lever on their slot machines and watch in awe as the reels spring to life.</p>\n<h2>Advancements in Security</h2>\n<p>We\u2019re also likely to see great enhancements to security within the industry. Fairness of games and the safety of your hard-earned cash is always a worry if you love playing for real money, but the industry continues to update security measure, which means more and more gamers are sure to jump on the virtual gaming wagon in the coming year.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2324\" src=\"https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/499979-ransomware-feature__zoom.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/499979-ransomware-feature__zoom.jpg 800w, https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/499979-ransomware-feature__zoom-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/499979-ransomware-feature__zoom-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/499979-ransomware-feature__zoom-747x420.jpg 747w, https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/499979-ransomware-feature__zoom-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/499979-ransomware-feature__zoom-681x383.jpg 681w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Data collection and storage are also earmarked for advancements. The more data an online casino can collect and analyse, the more game developers can tailor their casino games to new audiences, the likelihood of games growing in popularity.</p>\n<h2>2018 Themes and Titles</h2>\n<p>The increase in casino players and in general the public\u2019s interest in online casino games is leading to more and more themed casino games being released, with no signs of slowing down in 2018.</p>\n<p>As new trends crop up during the year, having access to data that shows upcoming trends is sure to prove invaluable to gaming developers and designers that want to jump onboard by bringing out relevant and popular games, be it based on the latest musical artists, movie characters, or even the 2018 foodie fads. What we can expect, is online casinos to really leverage pop trends this coming year and show them off within the games.</p>\n<p>Game developers are also likely to be drawn towards the popular social games, with hopes of converting an audience that is already interested in real money online casino players. That, coupled with the chance to win real money, is sure to provide a good incentive for online casinos and players alike.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2326\" src=\"https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/d6c18d23ea31d7ccaf3974fdf049770a.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"240\" srcset=\"https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/d6c18d23ea31d7ccaf3974fdf049770a.jpg 360w, https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/d6c18d23ea31d7ccaf3974fdf049770a-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" /></p>\n<p>Whether you are an avid online casino player, or you fancy dabbling in the year to come, there are enough great improvements, additions, and enhancements to look forward to.

A few days ago Michael Pedersen and Stefan Lind released the details on their new casino venture LetsBet.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWe believe the new frontier in online real-money casino is a mash-up of live streaming, social features and gamification\u201d \u00a0CEO &amp; Co-founder of Letsbet.com Michael Pedersen.</p></blockquote>\n<p>LetsBet will launch in early 2018 and offer players something fresh, interactive and exciting. \u00a0The pair spent a year researching the online casino industry and strongly believe they have found the missing piece and can fill the gap in this ever-changing market. Their new casino venture revolves around three core elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Live streaming</li>\n<li>Social</li>\n<li>Gamification</li>\n</ul>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BsxeT41D6OE?rel=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>This new way of casino gaming offers players a more interactive and sociable experience than ever before.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWhen you visit a land-based casino, do you sit down at the empty Blackjack table or the one with one seat left and people having fun? Casino players might not always want to directly speak to other players, but it\u2019s clear that they often like to interact with the casino staff and enjoy the indirect presence of other players; that\u2019s what we are trying to replicate using the latest technology.\u201d\u00a0 Stefan Lind.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The casino is based on a secret agent theme all players that sign up will be considered as new recruits. As they complete their missions and objectives they will be able to move up the ranks. Another great feature will be the social integration allowing players to connect with friends via instant chat conversations while playing.</p>\n<p>The casino will hold an MGA license and is launching via the Together Gaming Platform. The gaming software will be from NetEnt, Microgaming, Yggdrasil and Quickspin. This is definitely a casino we will be testing out once it launches.

The world&#8217;s most popular camera, now even better. The smartest, most powerful chip ever in a smartphone. Wireless charging that\u2019s truly effortless. And augmented reality experiences never before possible. iPhone 8. A new generation of iPhone.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Apple website</em></p>\n<p>The iPhone 8 is entirely formed from glass, front and back. Crazy idea considering how many of us have experienced a smashed screen and then paid the extortionate price for a repair? But, alas this is the most durable glass ever in a smart phone say Apple. Yeah, we will have to see it to believe it. Another benefit of this glass phone is that it is water and dust resistant. The phone comes as a 4.7inch and 5.5-inch with retina HD display.</p>\n<p>Moving onto the camera which for some people is probably the most used feature of their phone, Apple claims their camera is the world\u2019s most popular camera and to be honest they are probably right but, is it the best camera? The new iPhone 8 features a more advanced 12 mega pixel camera, a new colour filter and optical image stabilization. The CPU is powered by the most powerful chip yet an A11 Bionic that makes use of four efficiency cores that are 70% faster than the A10 Fusion plus two performance cores that are up to 25% faster. The iPhone 8 also makes use of wireless charging meaning not having to replace your charging cable every six months.</p>\n<h2>Then we get the iPhone X</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2278\" src=\"https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gsmarena_002.jpg\" alt=\"Apple iPhone X\" width=\"728\" height=\"272\" srcset=\"https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gsmarena_002.jpg 728w, https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gsmarena_002-300x112.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /></p>\n<p>What is the main feature of this new smart phone? The fact that it is entirely a screen\u2026 Mmmmm okay, Apple you really pushed boundaries with this on (in case you didn\u2019t know that was dripping in sarcasm).</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our vision has always been to create an iPhone that is entirely screen. One so immersive the device itself disappears into the experience. And so intelligent it can respond to a tap, your voice and even a glance. With iPhone X, that vision is now a reality. Say hello to the future.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Apple Website</em></p>\n<p>The iPhone X is an all-new 5.8-inch super retina screen that works all the way to the rounded corners thanks to new techniques and technology. The screen is OLED and uses a 1,000,000 to 1 contrast ratio. Like the iPhone 8 the X is also entirely glass \u2013 yip that same durable glass (notice how they don\u2019t say unbreakable) that is water and dust resistance (pity not crack resistant). This phone also differs from the standard iPhone as it does not have a home button but rather, a feature called intuitive gestures.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Familiar gestures make navigation natural and intuitive. Instead of pressing a button, a single swipe takes you home from anywhere.</p></blockquote>\n<p>What also makes this phone unique is the face ID feature housed at the top of the phone alongside the camera. You can now use your face as your password for unlocking your phone and authenticating payments. Moving across to Animoji something that we are sure will be popular with teens and hipsters. The true depth camera can analyze over 50 facial muscles that you can mirror your expressions into emoji meaning now you can turn the pig, panda or cat into yourself. The Camera features are pretty similar to the iPhone 8 and the X also makes use of A11 Bionic technology. In terms of power efficiency, the iPhone X is expected to last 2 hours longer than the iPhone7.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WYYvHb03Eog?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h3>Dates and prices</h3>\n<p>The iPhone 8 will be on offer for pre-order from 15 September and should be released on September 22 in Canada. The cost for a 65GB iPhone X is expected to be around $930 CAD. While an iPhone X will set you back around $1,320 CAD \u2013 the official release dates have not been released yet but you should be able to get an iPhone X from around October.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.gamingpost.ca/canadian-gaming-news/apple-iphone-8-announced-alongside-highly-anticipated-iphone-x/\">Apple iPhone 8 announced alongside highly anticipated iPhone X</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.gamingpost.ca\">GamingPost.ca - Your source for Canadian Gaming News</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Microgaming announce Halloween release for October</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.gamingpost.ca/canadian-casino-news/microgaming-announce-halloween-release-october/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 08 Sep 2017 12:40:57 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[admin]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Casino News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Online Casino News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.gamingpost.ca/?p=2272</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Microgaming has announced that their next BIG Blockbuster video slot will be released in October.

We could have guessed as much seeing as the game is none other than Halloween\u00ae</p>\n<p>From the looks of things the slot game has stayed true to the original movie and features characters and scenes that will have you longing for a late night scream session. The game has very old school look to it but, I personally like that as I feel it goes hand in hand with the sound effects and of course the original movie soundtrack by John Carpenter. I was never a fan of the more modern Halloween movies I have always preferred the original cult classic!</p>\n<p>Microgaming has added some great bonus features like the bonus wheel with guaranteed multiplier wins, a scratch pick to escape game and free spins with four different character features. We really can&#8217;t wait to get our fingers spinning the reels of this game so we can test out all these bonuses.</p>\n<p>Watch the preview video below for more:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OpbwP4HJsf8?rel=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.gamingpost.ca/canadian-casino-news/microgaming-announce-halloween-release-october/\">Microgaming announce Halloween release for October</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.gamingpost.ca\">GamingPost.ca - Your source for Canadian Gaming News</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Gnome Wood Casino Game to launch</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.gamingpost.ca/canadian-gaming-news/gnome-wood-casino-game-launch/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2017 07:35:26 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[admin]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Casino News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Gaming News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.gamingpost.ca/?p=2266</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>This September Microgaming Casinos will be launching the latest Rabcat casino game Gnome Wood.

Gnome Wood is a slot game that will take you on an adventure to an enchanted forest with a cute little magical Gnome who wants to award you jackpots and bonuses. This slot game is a 3&#215;5 reel slot game with 25 fixed paylines and some great bonus features. First, up the two standard bonus features, we are used to, free spins bonus and a gamble option. The other bonus feature is wandering wilds, these wilds have the power to move across the reels after each spin.

This is because gaming enthusiasts like myself cannot accept taking a perfectly functioning and entertaining video game and creating a mediocre game, rather don\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />t bother. But having said that some video games were actually born to be board games, the logistics, tact and skill required to play were probably inspired by the humble board game. So if you want to test out some of the best board games inspired by video games then read on.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00c2\u00a0According to <a href=\"https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/07/the-7-best-boardgames-based-on-videogames.html\">Paste Magazine</a> these are the games you should be playing. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>This War of Mine</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>If you haven\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />t had quite enough of watching innocent people die in the ruins of a bombed-out city on screen, now you can do it on a board. This is a cooperative affair that mimics the mechanics of the original quite closely. By day you\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />re working on your shelter. By night you\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />re venturing out into the ravaged buildings to scavenge for supplies.</p>\n<p>What makes the whole thing come together is the included book of stories. It\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />s a little like a choose your own adventure affair that garnishes play with a rich level of narrative. The result is a unique experience, but not always a happy one.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>XCOM: The Board Game</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>Just as the original heralded a rebirth of popular strategy on screen, so this launched a whole new genre of board games driven by mobile apps. While the players work together training soldiers and managing resources, an AI in the app dictates alien plans and movement.</p>\n<p>What turns the game into a thrilling pressure cooker, though, is that the app also puts a timer on all your activities. So instead of carefully measured planning, everyone ends up screaming at each other to make decisions before the clock runs down. In a neat twist the player controlling the app can waste precious seconds to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scan\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for alien activity and get clues as to what\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />s coming next.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gears of War: The Board Game</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>At this point, we\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />d forgive you for thinking there was a theme going on in the way publishers title these games. And there\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />s another, too: videogame licenses are expensive and board game publishers are poor. So when the license expires, the game is no longer in print and prices skyrocket. Such is the case for this Gears of War game, which now fetches three figure sums.</p>\n<p>You might think that\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />s surprising, given that the slow pace of board gaming is anathema to an action game like Gears. Yet this is a startling and brilliant re-creation which focuses on the tactical use of equipment and cover. In yet another common theme, it\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />s a co-operative game with players controlling individual Gears against the Locust horde.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>StarCraft: The Board Game</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>Real-time strategy is a much closer fit to the board game strategy and this 2007 adaptation didn\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />t disappoint. In addition to innovative combat and resource management, it framed everything in a high-level campaign. Players competed with their factions for control of a modular map of interconnected planets.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately it\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />s been out of print for some years and now sells for eye-watering sums. Fortunately you can still experience much of its brilliance with a different theme. The publisher re-used a lot of its ideas in the Forbidden Stars game, set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. That is now also out of license and out of print so if you like the sound of it, grab it now before prices go\u00c2\u00a0interstellar.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Mechs VS Minions</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>Strangely, this\u00c2\u00a0League of Legends\u00c2\u00a0board game didn\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />t come from an independent publisher but direct from Riot Games. And it\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />s a labor of love, arriving in a colossal box full of gleefully overproduced components. There are metal coins, plastic gems, painted Yardles and exactly one hundred minion miniatures.</p>\n<p>It\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />s another co-op affair, but with a twist. Players don\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />t move their pieces directly but instead assign them a program of orders before a timer runs out. Then it\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />s general hilarity as the unexpected consequences of mistakes play out like a line of dominoes toppling over. Print runs are limited, so invest now if you fancy it.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>DOOM: The Board Game</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>As if the rules to tabletop games weren\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />t confusing enough, publishers like to confuse you with editions, too. There\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />s a 2004 board game version of this, which is okay. There\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />s also a 2016 reboot to go with the reboot of the digital version, which is a whole lot better.</p>\n<p>One player controls the demons while all the others work together as marines against the hellish horde. Combat is fast, fun and tactical all at once. And a variety of objectives for all the different players ensures replay value with no two games playing out the same.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Dark Souls: The Board Game</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>The source game presents designers with a problem: how to re-create the learning experience that characterizes the series? Well, this game went with the grind. It\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />s a tough challenge. But players can gain an edge by practicing against repeated waves of underlings before trying it on against the boss.</p>\n<p>When they do, they\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />re in for a treat. Although the characters and enemies are all drawn from the original game, boss fights literally take it up a notch. Half way through the fight, they get a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153heat up\u00e2\u20ac\u009d card giving them a whole new slew of abilities. It\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />s down to players to handle the sudden change as best they can, otherwise it\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />s the dreaded \u00e2\u20ac\u0153YOU DIED\u00e2\u20ac\u009d text all over again.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So what are your thoughts do you agree, better yet what video game would you like to see immortalized into a board game.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.gamingpost.ca/canadian-gaming-news/2261/\">The best board games from video games.</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.gamingpost.ca\">GamingPost.ca - Your source for Canadian Gaming News</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The best free games on iPhone this week</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.gamingpost.ca/canadian-gaming-news/best-free-games-iphone-week/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 07 Aug 2017 12:39:25 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[admin]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Gaming News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Mobile Games]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.gamingpost.ca/?p=2252</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>If you are already bored waiting for the next episode of Game of Thrones to air\u00c2\u00a0next you are in luck.

This news follows the recent launch of Jurassic World and the earlier announcement of a Phantom of the Opera game.</p>\n<h2>Halloween Online Slot Game</h2>\n<p>At present, all that has been mentioned regarding the new Halloween slot game is that the license has been agreed and that the game is already in production. I am going to give an educated guess that the game will probably launch in October in time for Halloween celebrations.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Halloween is a true classic and set the standard for modern horror films. It was immeasurably influential in the slasher genre of movies, so it is great to be working with such an iconic and respected brand. Embracing all the elements of what made the movie such a success, our games team are busy developing a slot for release later in the year.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d</p></blockquote>\n<p>David Reynolds, Games Publisher at Microgaming<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2238 alignright\" src=\"https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/jurassic-world-game.jpg\" alt=\"jurassic-world-game\" width=\"650\" height=\"365\" srcset=\"https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/jurassic-world-game.jpg 650w, https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/jurassic-world-game-300x168.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /></p>\n<h2>Jurassic World Online Slot</h2>\n<p>Jurassic World was not only the sequel to the hit movie Jurassic Park but also the sequel to the award winning slot game Jurassic Park. When Microgaming created this slot they created a winner, the original slot was full of high-quality graphics, special features and bonus rounds. We expected a lot when we heard that Jurassic World was launching and we were not disappointed. This new slot game immerses the player 100% into the dino world thanks to high-quality graphics and animations. The game launched last month and has been a popular choice for most players at Microgaming casinos.</p>\n<h2>Phantom of the Opera Online Slot\u00c2\u00a0<img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2237\" src=\"https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The-Phantom-of-the-Opera-microgaming.jpg\" alt=\"The-Phantom-of-the-Opera-microgaming\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The-Phantom-of-the-Opera-microgaming.jpg 800w, https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The-Phantom-of-the-Opera-microgaming-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The-Phantom-of-the-Opera-microgaming-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The-Phantom-of-the-Opera-microgaming-350x175.jpg 350w, https://www.gamingpost.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The-Phantom-of-the-Opera-microgaming-400x200.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></h2>\n<p>Earlier in the year, Microgaming announced a Phantom of the Opera game in the making. One thing we can say is this did not thrill us to the max or excite us. But, maybe that is because we are not huge fans of singing stage productions, it\u00e2\u20ac<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />s just not our thing. But we are sure fans of the franchise will be excited to play this game when it launches later this year.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.gamingpost.ca/canadian-casino-news/new-blockbuster-slot-games-microgaming/\">New blockbuster slot games from Microgaming</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.gamingpost.ca\">GamingPost.ca - Your source for Canadian Gaming News</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n",
