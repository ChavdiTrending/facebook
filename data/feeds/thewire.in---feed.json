However, how did it all come about? For example, when did we start wearing clothes?</p>\n<p>The trouble with this kind of investigation is the lack of hard evidence. Clothes, unlike bones, do not fossilise and, unlike stone and metal, perish quickly. So except under special environmental conditions in which some palaeo-humans (such as the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/26/world/europe/bolzano-italy-iceman-south-tyrol-museum-of-archaeology.html\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"iceman \u00d6tzi\" >iceman \u00d6tzi</a>) have been unearthed, direct evidence of prehistoric clothing has remained scant and the origins of clothes have been lost in the mists of time.</p>\n<p>But scientists were able to find a workaround in the form of a small insect.</p>\n<p><strong>The pest family</strong></p>\n<p>Almost all mammalian and avian species are host to various species of lice. But humans are among the few species that are host to three (or subspecies). The human head louse (<em>Pediculus humanus capitis</em>), the body louse (<em>P. humanus corporis</em>, also considered\u00a0<em>P. humanus humanus</em>) and the pubic louse (<em>Pthirus pubis</em>) are obligate ectoparasites to the human body and can&#8217;t survive on other species, including pets.</p>\n<p>Head louse are slightly smaller in size than body louse and usually have a darker pigmentation. There are subtle differences in the lengths and widths of their antennae and front legs. But not surprisingly, the head louse and body louse have considerable morphological similarities. The principle difference lies in their choice of habitat.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_219688\" style=\"max-width: 670px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/31165624/rtyu.jpg?ssl=1\"  ><img data-attachment-id=\"219688\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/219667/tiny-insect-used-trace-origins-human-clothing/rtyu/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/31165624/rtyu.jpg?fit=660%2C263\" data-orig-size=\"660,263\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Lenovo&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1517416396&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"rtyu\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/31165624/rtyu.jpg?fit=300%2C120\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/31165624/rtyu.jpg?fit=660%2C263\" class=\"size-full wp-image-219688\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/31165624/rtyu.jpg?resize=660%2C263&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"263\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lice that paracitise humans: (L-R) head louse, body louse and pubic louse. Credit: Wikimedia Commons</p></div>\n<p>The head louse is a bloodsucking insect that lives\u00a0only on the scalp\u00a0and lays eggs only on scalp hair. The body louse, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t venture towards the head. It feeds off of the human skin. But perhaps more notably, it lives and lays eggs in human clothing.</p>\n<p>The head louse and the body louse are fastidious about their habitats: neither encroaches into the other\u2019s territory (in fact, the head louse can&#8217;t live on clothes). Neither species can survive away from a human host for long: the head louse perishes within 24 hours, while the body louse. Mark Stoneking, now a scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, took interest in the migration of these obligate parasites across the globe, hoping they would lead him to clues about human migrations themselves.</p>\n<p>He hypothesised that the head louse was an ancestral species and that the body louse evolved from the head louse\u00a0when a new ecological niche got available: the folds and creases of human clothes. When could this have happened? The likeliest answer is when humans started wearing clothes regularly.</p>\n<p>This leads to the intriguing possibility that zeroing in on the time when the body louse evolved from the head louse would by inference correspond to the beginning of extensive use of clothing by ancestral human populations. To get at this, Stoneking and his peers use a molecular clock.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_219687\" style=\"max-width: 653px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/31165623/jhjgfgdfghj.jpg?ssl=1\"  ><img data-attachment-id=\"219687\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/219667/tiny-insect-used-trace-origins-human-clothing/jhjgfgdfghj/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/31165623/jhjgfgdfghj.jpg?fit=643%2C425\" data-orig-size=\"643,425\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Lenovo&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1517417039&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"jhjgfgdfghj\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/31165623/jhjgfgdfghj.jpg?fit=300%2C198\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/31165623/jhjgfgdfghj.jpg?fit=643%2C425\" class=\"size-full wp-image-219687\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/31165623/jhjgfgdfghj.jpg?resize=643%2C425&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"643\" height=\"425\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mark Stoneking, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.

It is based on the principle that, as time passes, random errors and/or substitutions creep into the species&#8217;s DNA when it replicates during reproduction; these &#8216;errors&#8217; get transmitted down generations. So the longer it has been since two sequences diverged, the more the number of differences between their DNAs.</p>\n<p>This problem is further simplified if the value of a single parameter can be computed:\u00a0the number of substitutions per million years. This can be calculated using the number of substitutions that have accumulated in two DNA sequences whose divergence-time is actually well-known from other lines of evidence (e.g., from the fossil record). Assuming the error rate stays constant across time and in different species, this allows scientists to calculate the unknown time points.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_219684\" style=\"max-width: 645px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/31165620/efg.jpg?ssl=1\"  ><img data-attachment-id=\"219684\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/219667/tiny-insect-used-trace-origins-human-clothing/efg/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/31165620/efg.jpg?fit=635%2C507\" data-orig-size=\"635,507\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Lenovo&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1517417070&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"efg\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/31165620/efg.jpg?fit=300%2C240\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/31165620/efg.jpg?fit=635%2C507\" class=\"wp-image-219684 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/31165620/efg.jpg?resize=635%2C507&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Calibrating the human molecular clock.

Credit: Anirban Mitra</p></div>\n<p><strong>Truth and lice</strong></p>\n<p>The molecular clock for dating lice evolution was built using two mitochondrial DNA and two nuclear DNA segments. To avoid any bias in their investigation, the scientists collected lice from 12 geographical regions \u2013 Ethiopia, Panama, Germany, Philippines, Iran, Ecuador, Laos, Papua New Guinea, the US, Taiwan, Nepal and the UK \u2013 and extracted their nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. They also collected DNA from chimpanzee head louse.</p>\n<p>Since it is well known that hosts and their parasites often coevolve, it was assumed that the chimpanzee louse (<em>Pediculus schaeffi</em>) and\u00a0<em>P. humanus\u00a0</em>must have co-speciated with their respective hosts and that this must have happened around 5.5 million years ago \u2013 the time when humans and chimps also diverged. Thus, the differences between DNA sequences of chimp louse and human head louse must have accumulated over 5.5 million years. Using this duration, the time when the head louse and the body louse diverged was estimated.</p>\n<p>Stoneking and his team analysed DNA from both the nucleus as well as the mitochondria of lice. First, they analysed the DNA sequence of two genes \u2013 ND4 and CYTB \u2013 present only in mitochondrial DNA. Next, they studied the sequence of two important nuclear genes \u2013 EF-1\u03b1 and RPII. It was not necessary to sequence them completely; a few fragments of 400-600 base pairs each sufficed.</p>\n<p>The first <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12932325\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"result\" >result</a> clearly showed that the African louse (collected from Ethiopia) was genetically more diverse than the non-African lice. The finding mirrored the greater genetic diversity of humans seen in Africa compared to those in other continents. Since greater genetic diversity almost invariably occurs at the source, the results indicate the African origin of the human louse.</p>\n<p>Similarly, they found that the human head louse was more genetically diverse than its cousin, the body louse \u2013 proving that the head louse was the ancestral species.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_219683\" style=\"max-width: 674px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/31165618/cdvfbghjn.jpg?ssl=1\"  ><img data-attachment-id=\"219683\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/219667/tiny-insect-used-trace-origins-human-clothing/cdvfbghjn/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/31165618/cdvfbghjn.jpg?fit=664%2C522\" data-orig-size=\"664,522\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Lenovo&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1517417231&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"cdvfbghjn\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/31165618/cdvfbghjn.jpg?fit=300%2C236\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/31165618/cdvfbghjn.jpg?fit=664%2C522\" class=\"size-full wp-image-219683\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/31165618/cdvfbghjn.jpg?resize=664%2C522&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"664\" height=\"522\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Phylogenetic tree showing the divergence of of the apes and their evolutionary relationship</p></div>\n<p>Next, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using all the mitochondrial sequences of human lice. This is a tree-like diagrammatic representation that describes the evolutionary relationships between the organisms being studied. It showed the presence of a number of clades; a clade is a group of all sequences used in a study that have descended from the same ancestral sequence. The deepest clades contained only head louse sequences, confirming that the body louse had originated from the head louse.</p>\n<p>One clade in particular contained all the body lice and 16 head lice sequences, and included samples from all over the world. The molecular clock showed that this clade was 32,000-112,000 years old. Since it contained all the body lice sequences, the estimated age of this clade had to form the upper limit for the time since the body louse first evolved.

In other words, it was starting to look as if anatomically modern humans started wearing clothes around 70,000 years ago.</p>\n<p>In a subsequent test, David Reed and his colleagues from the University of Florida, Gainesville, performed a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002236/\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"more robust analysis\" >more robust analysis</a> and concluded that the body louse had diverged around 170,000 years ago and certainly not after 83,000 years ago. The difference between the two sets of data is not surprising given the different methodologies used. However, they are in broad agreement. Both conclude that the body louse evolved in the presence of anatomically modern humans in Africa because of the availability of a new ecological niche: clothes.</p>\n<p>What if clothing originated much earlier and if the louse had colonised this ecological niche later? This possibility can&#8217;t be entirely discounted. Stoneking believes that, since a new ecological niche is colonised fairly rapidly, it is unlikely that clothing could have existed for thousands of years before the body louse marched upon it. The genetic data also corresponds well with the archaeological finding that the earliest eyed needles \u2013 the only prehistoric tools that can be definitely associated with clothing \u2013 are about 40,000 years old, and they have been found only in settlements of modern humans, not among archaic humans like the Neanderthals.</p>\n<p>In sum, the genetic and archaeological data both converge on the conclusion that the chimp louse and the human head louse are close cousins that must have originated from a common ancestor. The human head louse was confined to one relatively smaller habitat (the scalp), when ancestral humans lost a significant amount of body hair about 1.2 million years ago. Then, sometime between 70,000 and 170,000 years ago, anatomically modern humans started stitching and wearing clothes and the lice could now colonise them.

Source: YouTube</p></div>\n<p>A black panther, like a white tiger, is almost a chimaera. Usually, panthers are tawny yellow with dark spots; the entirely black ones are a rarity in their melanism and occurrence. The new Marvel film\u00a0<em>Black Panther</em>\u00a0has been acclaimed for putting forward a black superhero. This celebration of blackness has been described as being part of\u00a0<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/15/entertainment/black-panther-movie-movement/index.html\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"a cultural movement\" >a cultural movement</a> for starting long-overdue conversations on race. The movie succeeds in creating a vibrant, empowering space for black representation, and also portrays valuable ideas on wildlife and environmental sustainability.</p>\n<p>You could search forests for black panthers \u2013 used as an acceptable term for the melanistic black jaguars found in Central and Southern America and the melanistic black leopards found in Asia (often in Kabini, Karnataka) \u2013 and never be able to actually see one. The fact that the film refers to a panther who is \u2018black\u2019 is not just a corporeal allusion to the protagonist, Prince T\u2019Challa (played by Chadwick Boseman), and his skin colour. In the movie\u2019s mythology, this is more a symbol of uncommonness as found in the wild black panther. This is significant because the movie consistently inverts the very meaning of what it means to be black. Being black is about being empowered rather than being the victim.</p>\n<p>Most of the film is set in the fictitious African country of Wakanda. Unsurprisingly, the world thinks the country is poor and backward, perpetuating the usual stereotype that homogenises all countries in the entire African continent as impoverished intellectually and financially. In reality, Wakanda is a wondrous country with technology far exceeding that of the rest of the world because it contains exclusive reserves of the mineral called vibranium.</p>\n<p>It is also interesting to see how <em>Black Panther</em> deals with notions of African bestiality. Colonialists called Africa the \u2018dark continent\u2019 for its thick forest cover and unfamiliarity; it was characterised as a place with savage people and uncontrollable wild beasts. Modern-day politics reveals similarly tired stereotypes. The African Union has asked US President Donald Trump <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42670715\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"to apologise\" >to apologise</a> after he reportedly called all of Africa a \u2018shithole\u2019. Wakanda, on the other hand, embraces the idea of beasts in the creation of a modern, high-tech country. People in Wakanda wear their natural and cultural heritage on their sleeves, fiercely, with fantastic jewellery, rituals and dances.</p>\n<p>A particular mountainous tribe derives its identity from wild mountain gorillas and is led by M\u2019Baku (Winston Duke), an unforgettable character. The tribals are hulking, brave and make whooping calls but, despite their seemingly menacing visage, are vegetarian like the gorillas. Then, there are gigantic rhinos, characterised as dangerous but endearing beasts \u2013 both wild yet familiar, a homage perhaps to how contemporary safari-lovers and conservationists feel about African rhinos. This narrative is a sharp rejection of bestiality, and the sole white man witnessing all this is like the token black man in other Hollywood fare. He is agape at the world around him, often tongue-tied, becoming the butt of more than one joke.</p>\n<p>The central conceit of the movie is resource use \u2013 specifically, what kind of power Wakanda should wield and how it should utilise its resources when the country is forced to consider addressing race-based crime in other parts of the world. Wakanda has historically decided to seal itself off to keep vibranium a secret and to prosper, albeit in isolation. The central dilemma between T\u2019Challa and the antagonist, his cousin Erik (Michael B. Jordan), is on the use of this resource. T\u2019Challa\u2019s method of resource management is geared towards a robust laboratory culture and science and technology while Erik wants to press vibranium into the service of violence.</p>\n<p>Described as a \u201cradicalised\u201d black male who has grown up in a rough American neighbourhood, Erik wants to overthrow White Rule in other countries by equipping \u2018wardogs\u2019 with vibranium. He\u2019d easily be called a terrorist in most countries, a fact he seems to be aware of \u2013 and the movie asks you to take pause on how a revolution should be fought on the possession of great minerals that can also become awesome weapons.</p>\n<p>All-powerful resources and the fight for them has been screenplay gold for many fantasy franchises. James Cameron\u2019s <em>Avatar</em>\u00a0(2009) had a brutal, colonising effort to oust tribals for reserves of unobtainium on an alien planet. The <em>X-Men</em> and Wolverine franchises had the unbreakable metal alloy adamantium being used to create soldiers with indestructible body parts.</p>\n<p>Some characters choose the path of sustainability and preserving traditional, ecological knowledge, such as the careful use of cultivated herbs that grant power. Yet others, like a parallel to politicians who may use nuclear physics irresponsibly, have no use for tradition or sustainability.</p>\n<p>Technology transfers, housing refugees and the thoughtful use of resources, not just to live in the present but also to address historic wrongs, are all consequent debates in <em>Black Panther</em>. These are also important aspects of climate change negotiations ongoing around the world. The movie\u2019s valorisation of a blend of science and nature, and sovereignty through a particular cultural and natural heritage, will appeal to many.</p>\n<p><em>Black Panther</em>\u00a0triumphs in characterising blackness as a stunning and powerful quality, comparable to how a wilderness enthusiast may feel when she stumbles upon a wild black panther, a creature so dream-like it could almost be mythical. And that rare quality \u2013 of a panther that is black \u2013 could also be a stand-in for a movie such as this one, as uncommon as they come.</p>\n<p><em>Neha Sinha\u00a0is a Delhi-based conservationist.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/225290/black-panther-deadly-rapturous-blend-tech-polity-nativity/\">\u2018Black Panther\u2019 Is Deadly for Its Rapturous Blend of Tech, Polity and Nativity</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://thewire.in/225290/black-panther-deadly-rapturous-blend-tech-polity-nativity/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">225290</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>In Southeast Asia, Internet Freedom Is Rapidly Declining</title>\n\t\t<link>https://thewire.in/225252/southeast-asia-internet-freedom-rapidly-declining/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://thewire.in/225252/southeast-asia-internet-freedom-rapidly-declining/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 12:30:58 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Pascal Laureyn]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Digital]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[External Affairs]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Fake News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[World]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[censorship]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[fake news]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Freedom of Internet]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Internet]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[media freedom]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[no-donate-link]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[social media]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Southeast Asia]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://thewire.in/?p=225252</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Apart from censorship being an issue in the region, fake news is also being used to eliminate opponents or to manipulate public opinion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/225252/southeast-asia-internet-freedom-rapidly-declining/\">In Southeast Asia, Internet Freedom Is Rapidly Declining</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Apart from censorship being an issue in the region, fake news is also being used to eliminate opponents or to manipulate public opinion.</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_225260\" style=\"max-width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-attachment-id=\"225260\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/225252/southeast-asia-internet-freedom-rapidly-declining/36706724615_c2bb8a31be_b/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18145004/36706724615_c2bb8a31be_b.jpg?fit=1024%2C683\" data-orig-size=\"1024,683\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"36706724615_c2bb8a31be_b\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18145004/36706724615_c2bb8a31be_b.jpg?fit=300%2C200\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18145004/36706724615_c2bb8a31be_b.jpg?fit=1024%2C683\" class=\"size-full wp-image-225260\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18145004/36706724615_c2bb8a31be_b.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students of Araura College during their computer class in Aitutaki, Cook Islands.

Half of them experienced a decline of internet freedom. China, Syria and Ethiopia are the least free. Estonia, Iceland and Canada enjoy the most freedom online.<span id=\"more-154339\"></span></p>\n<p>The most remarkable evolution comes from Southeast Asia. A few years ago, this was a promising region. The economy was growing, democracy was on the rise. Malaysia had free elections, Indonesia started an anti-corruption campaign and the social rights of Cambodian garment workers were improving.</p>\n<p>\u201cInternet helped these movements grow,\u201d says Madeline Earp, Asia research analyst with Freedom House. \u201cAll kinds of organisations and media started using internet more and more. That was hopeful.\u201d</p>\n<p>Today, democratisation has faltered. A military coup in Thailand and the dissolution of an opposition party in Cambodia are just two examples of autocratic governments resisting change.</p>\n<p><strong>Censorship, arrests and violence</strong></p>\n<p>According to the report, seven of the eight Southeast Asian countries researched have become less free in the last year.</p>\n<p>\u201cCensorship is on the rise and internet freedom is declining,\u201d Earp says. \u201cMyanmar and Cambodia were the biggest disappointments.\u201d</p>\n<p>Recently, journalists were arrested in Myanmar. Fake news spreads hate speech and incites violence against Muslims. Today, Myanmar has more journalists in prison then in the last years of the military regime.</p>\n<p>In Cambodia, an independent newspaper was shut down. Activists who denounce illegal activities of companies are being arrested. In Thailand the strict lese-majeste law is used to silence opponents. The Philippines has a growing number of \u2018opinion shapers\u2019 to push pro-government propaganda.</p>\n<p>The only country that has improved its score is Malaysia. But Freedom House says that is mostly because of increasing internet use. Repression is not keeping up with the rapid growth. This shows that Malaysia is following a trend in Southeast Asia. The restriction on freedom of speech starts when internet use goes up.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Malaysian government has censored news websites. At least one Malaysian has been sentenced for a post on Facebook,\u201d Earp adds.</p>\n<p><strong>The Chinese example</strong></p>\n<p>Part of the cause is to be found in China. The influential country has the world\u2019s least free internet for three years, according to the Freedom House report. It uses a sophisticated surveillance system, known as the \u2018Great Firewall\u2019. An army of supervisors check on the internet use of the Chinese, from messaging apps to traffic cameras.</p>\n<p>Undesirable messages are being deleted by Chinese censors. Sometimes that can lead to absurd situations. A newly discovered beetle was named after President Xi Jinping. But messages about this event were deleted because the predatory nature of the beetle could be insulting to the leader.</p>\n<p>These practices play an important role in the decline of democracy in Southeast Asia. \u201cVietnam is copying the techniques of China,\u201d says researcher Madeline Earp. \u201cMore bloggers and activists are being arrested because of their social media use.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Fake news</strong></p>\n<p>Not only censorship is an issue. In Southeast Asia, fake news is being used to eliminate opponents or to manipulate public opinion. This is what Ed Legaspi, director of the Southeast Asian Press Alliance, explains in<em> The Bulletin</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWorryingly, many governments have taken advantage of existing mechanisms in social media to spread rumours and combat critical voices,\u201d says Legaspi. \u201cThailand\u2019s lese majeste law, Malaysian\u2019s sedition act and Indonesia\u2019s blasphemy law have all been used to curtail online speech.\u201d</p>\n<p>In Myanmar, inflammatory and racist language against Muslims provokes violent outbreaks regularly. Fake news sites spread rumours about a Buddhist woman who supposedly was raped by a Muslim. This contributed to the violence towards the Rohingya, a Muslim minority. And it helps the army to get support from a large part of the public.</p>\n<p>The role of social media cannot be underestimated. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Line, WhatsApp and WeChat are the most popular in Southeast Asia, but their initial power to spread free speech is declining.</p>\n<p>\u201cA few years ago, social media were safe havens for activists. But today these media companies are too cooperative with the autocratic regimes,\u201d says Legaspi. \u201cThey do nothing to protect their users.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Manipulated elections</strong></p>\n<p>Various countries are organising elections this year. How these governments will deal with these moments of tension will determine the evolution of internet freedom.</p>\n<p>Cambodia has elections with no opposition, Malaysia\u2019s polls are heavily manipulated. Not much positive news is expected there. In Indonesia, the regional elections in June will be the first test since a fake news campaign against Jakarta\u2019s once popular governor, Basuki \u2018Ahok\u2019 Tjahaja Purnama.

Credit: Wikimedia Commons</p></div>\n<p>It was around 2010 that I started my search for Sufism in my part of the world. Initially, the idea was to get away from the excessive heat generated after publication of my second book, <em>Military Inc</em>. But more importantly, working on the military had trained my mind to think about power from a people\u2019s perspective \u2013 what it meant for the ordinary folk, how was it applied on them and the varied relationships that stakeholders carved out to control the public.</p>\n<p>Someone from the family of the sufi-poet Khwaja Farid suggested that I should go back to my Sufi roots. My ancestor Khwaja Mohkam din Sairani was from the Owais-Qadri silsila. He was known to travel, thus the title Sairani or the one who travels, to call people towards Islam and engage them in a spiritual conversation. It was during one of his sojourns through Thar onto the marshy lands of Kutch that he died in Kathiawar, Gujarat in 1776 AD. But like most members of Sufi families, I had grown up conscious of, yet oblivious to my heritage.</p>\n<p>My real learning came through my mother and her work on Sufism. I had watched her work on her novelette <em>Chahra Bachehra Rubaru </em>about the inner journey of the Bahai poetess and Sufi, Quratulain Tahira, and later, her last novel <em>Dasht-e Soos </em>on Hussain bin Mansoor Hallaj\u2019s inner journey. I remember helping my mother chart it on an old map retrieved from Khana-e-farhang Iran, the path that Mansoor took on his journey to find his love:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Khana bakhana dar badar, kocha bakicha ko bako </em></p>\n<p>(From house to house, from door to door, and from corner to corner)</p></blockquote>\n<p>I remember when <em>Dashte Soos</em> came out and many discussions were held on the book; numerous writers, whom we would today assign to the category, for lack of a better word, \u2018liberal\u2019, expressed disappointment.</p>\n<p>Why hadn\u2019t Hallaj been presented as the saviour of the poor and a revolutionary character? It fell on deaf ears that the novel was not about what was happening around him but what mattered to him within. It was about discovering the vast mystery of \u2018<em>ana l\u2019haq</em>\u2019. What was it that made him so restless not to be able to contain his great secret? He was brutalised and tortured by the Caliph, al-Muqtadir, not for standing up for a worldly cause or being an ancient Marxist or Leninist, but for the fear that it would completely destroy the neat order of religion and religious teaching. He may have inadvertently challenged the orthodoxy but was that even his purpose? He was out on a journey not to discover but to lose himself. Sufism is a journey on which not everyone can embark but those who do are driven through an amazing maze of introspection, self-consciousness, self-denial and from one love to other.</p>\n<p>But in 1985, Sufism wasn\u2019t really fashionable as it is today. The decade of the 1980s was a watershed period in which a popular intellectual wave of dialectic materialism during the 1970s gently merged into a kind of liberalism that was the antithesis of the leftist-socialist ideology of the past. Later, religious discourse of the capitalist type took center stage. On the intellectual scene then, the Sufi instincts of Sindh, South Punjab and other parts of the country, or even the rest of South Asia, did not matter. The dominant narrative that was discussed in hotel rooms or coffee shops had nothing to do with what happened in the territorial backwaters. Sufism was taken at best as something that represented anti-modernity, which it was to a certain extent, but more on that later.</p>\n<p>It was difficult for writers in the mainstream to understand what Jamila Hashmi said in explaining the journey of her book \u2013 she had learnt a lot from being part of the Sufi family that she was married into.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding that we focus mostly on the socio-politics of Sufism, it has its own world comprising norms and a very hierarchical universe that can only be imagined through a deep interest in it or through experience. Sufi practice is not just about dance, music or an imagined freedom of expression, but it is about meditation, knowledge, control and surrendering your will and the self in pursuance of <em>tawhid </em>and <em>tawwakul</em>. There is, in fact, so much order in this seeming world of disorder that every experience counts.</p>\n<p>Jamila Hashmi studied Islamic history, the politics of Baghdad, even its weather patterns, but more importantly, the inner fire of Mansoor Hallaj that made him surrender his own life.</p>\n<p>\u201cHussain have you gone mad? Don\u2019t you care about losing your life?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not? I care about life because it is this life that stood in my way. Now I am free. Now Him and I are together like wine and water.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Ishq Mazrai Gulab hey,</em></p>\n<p><em>Ishq mazrai zindagi hey.</em></p>\n<p>Love is a bouquet of roses.</p>\n<p>Love is a bouquet of life.</p>\n<p>Indeed, it is fate that Love becomes a bouquet of flowers for some, and surrendering life for others.</p>\n<p>But in 1985, there were hardly any people among the urban intellectuals who were keen to engage with <em>Dasht-e Soos</em> or had interest in what the Andalusian Sufi Muhyi \u2018d Din Ibn Arabi\u2019s prayer meant: \u201cEnter me, O Lord, into the deep of the ocean of thine infinite oneness\u201d. In 629 AD, when the Holy Ka\u2019aba was cleaned out of approximately 360 deities, it was turned into a place to worship only one God, the omnipotent from whom we have come and to whom we will return.</p>\n<p>According to Martin Lings, the Holy Qur\u2019an was both a book meant for the entire community but also a message to the select. For instance, Surah Fateha that guides towards the straight path is also a message for the Sufi to explore how to embark upon it to attain the ultimate objective. To many, the message of the Holy Qur\u2019an is simple, and to some, it is highly intricate and is worth the life and self to swim through its many layers to reach its utmost depths. While in Islam Sufism is traced to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), Islam did not have a monopoly over it as all religious civilisations have it.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_36726\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<div id=\"attachment_225230\" style=\"max-width: 970px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18121403/1482762_130608887109872_218450380_n.jpg?ssl=1\"  ><img data-attachment-id=\"225230\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/225216/changing-face-sufism-south-asia/1482762_130608887109872_218450380_n/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18121403/1482762_130608887109872_218450380_n.jpg?fit=960%2C630\" data-orig-size=\"960,630\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"1482762_130608887109872_218450380_n\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18121403/1482762_130608887109872_218450380_n.jpg?fit=300%2C197\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18121403/1482762_130608887109872_218450380_n.jpg?fit=960%2C630\" class=\"size-full wp-image-225230\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18121403/1482762_130608887109872_218450380_n.jpg?resize=960%2C630&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"630\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Data Durbar. Credit: Facebook</p></div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Sufism in South Asia</strong></p>\n<p>But let me get back to what my mother experienced during the 1980s, and I indirectly through her. The dominant socio-political narrative in those days did not really engage with Sufism. This was not just because it was General Zia-ul-Haq\u2019s Pakistan where modern religious forms were dominated by the Jamaat-e-Islami, ahl-e Hadith, Deobandi and Barelvi ulema. And while Zia would visit the shrine of Ali Hajveri in Lahore, popularly known as Data Sahib, like rulers before him, the imagination of Sufism and the business of shrines was relegated to under-developed, primarily rural areas meant for seemingly superstitious and illiterate or less educated people.</p>\n<p>In fact, Sufism lost its luster after Partition in the urban centers as the state tried to de-empower shrines. Although General Ayub Khan was a follower of the pir of Dewal Sharif, he introduced the Auqaf department to bring all shrines under state control. According to Jamal Malik, the government-paid <em>mujawar </em>posted to the shrines turned indirectly into a kind of counter-weight to the shrine family.</p>\n<p>The liberal intellectuals, on the one hand, made their own contribution to minimising the influence of the shrines. To the urban intellectual, <em>piri-mureedi </em>denoted a form of exploitation. During the mid- or late 1970s, filmmaker Mushtaq Gazdar even made a documentary <em>They are killing the horse</em> (1979) highlighting the authoritarianism of the pirs. The right-wing intellectuals, on the other hand, were busy nurturing competitive but more modern religious discourses. The post-1947 discourse in a newly formed Islamic state had little patience for a pre-modern form of religion as it related to development of an Islamic state and society.</p>\n<p>As demonstrated by Dr Farzana Sheikh, Allama Muhammad Iqbal, who, on the one hand, was mesmerised by Jalaluddin Rumi, on the other hand, considered Sufism redundant in the process of creating a nation-state. Not that the pirs were politically redundant in a post-partition scenario. In his research on Punjab, American political scientist David Gilmartin has expanded on the role that pirs played in Pakistan\u2019s creation and insisted that the new state be \u2018Islamic\u2019.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the socio-politics of the shrines and their belief system was far too complex and diverse to turn it into a centerpiece of state ideology. The four major silsilas \u2013 Chishtiya, Qadriya, Suharwardiya and Naqshbandiya \u2013 had a religious ethos that was determined by a more hierarchical and centralised form which was dominated by the clergy and was better suited for the purpose. The fact is that nowhere in the subcontinent did Sufism play a dominant role in the formation of modern state structure. The fact that hundreds and thousands of people visit shrines is not necessarily a reflection of Sufism\u2019s political power.</p>\n<p><strong>Evolution of Sufi institutions</strong></p>\n<p>Sufism might have drifted further away from the primary intellectual imagination had 9/11 not taken place and the world not started its search for \u2018alternative\u2019 Muslim institutions that could bring peace to the world.</p>\n<p>It was then that foreign think tanks and policy centers began talking about Sufism and the local elite remembered shrines to be places where music, unconventional traits and ecstasy were found. The <em>dhammal </em>at Sehwan and other places began to look important without people even thinking about what it truly demonstrated. Peace was the new context of Sufism.</p>\n<p>What Islamic societies need is a review of how to engage and co-exist with other civilisations but the question remains whether Sufi Islam has the potential to do the needful? Recently, Prof Dr Mohammad Mahmoud Abu Hashim, vice president of Egypt\u2019s Al-Azhar University, <a href=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/1385289\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"spoke in Karachi about\" >spoke in Karachi about</a> Sufism\u2019s role in countering extremist tendencies.</p>\n<p>Notionally, this may be correct but it does not take into consideration the evolution of Sufi institutions and the process of Islamic revivalism in the world, especially South Asia. Let me be provocative and argue that Sufi syncretic culture today in South Asia is overstated. While tolerance may have been an inherent trait, the Sufi institution has evolved in a manner that it may not be able to deliver on this count. And while Sufi shrines will continue to be populated, their capacity to generate tolerance has serious limits which can be attributed to three factors: (a) the evolution of Sufi institutions and their relationship with power, (b) increasing socio-political and socio-economic modernity has little space for Sufism and (c) the lack of capacity of Sufi institutions to produce a counter narrative.</p>\n<p>Like in early Islam, Sufism had a great role to play in propagating Islamic ideology and culture in South Asia. The religion was brought to the region through traders and invaders from three routes: (a) sea, (b) from Persia through Sindh and (c) from Central Asia through Sindh and the Khyber Pass. While there is evidence of Arab interest in expanding into the Subcontinent dating back to 635 AD, any mention of an interaction with it is even earlier. Reportedly, a Hindu sufi by the name of Baba Ratan visited Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) twice and converted to Islam on his second visit. He is mentioned in Arab monographs. Interestingly, he is a figure who is owned by both Muslims and Hindus.</p>\n<p>Sufis bridged the communal divide as is evidenced by the reverence the Subcontinent\u2019s non-Muslim population exhibited for Sufi saints. The ordinary people considered these holy men a major source of intervention between some power out there that could fulfill wishes and cure pain and ailments. After all, God is indeed a human need.</p>\n<p>Sufism around the world and in the Subcontinent had the depth to connect beyond caste, creed and gender. While we remember the Sufi saint Rabiya Basri in South Asia there were others such as Bibi Tanur (the saint for bakers), Bibi Pak Daman, Bibi Ruqqaya.</p>\n<p>But such a wide space does not mean that Sufism has little care for religious norms. It is non-conformist in its ability to experiment with method of praying but not in terms of reverence to God and his Prophet. All Sufis were mindful of Sharia. For instance, Baba Farid, a Chishti saint, was of the view that \u201c<em>tilawat</em> of the Qur\u2019an is the best form of devotion. To read the Qur\u2019an is to converse with God\u201d. Bahauddin Zikriya advocated following the Sharia. In the case of music or <em>Samaa</em>, it was both part of the local culture and was a form of prayer. Even though music was introduced by some Sufi orders such as the Chisti and Qadri, the Naqshbandi prohibit it. In any case, as Ali Hajveri states, in music \u201cthe sufi desires not permissibility as the vulgar do, but spiritual advantage\u201d. The Tableeghi Jamaat in Malaysia play guitar in modern-day Malaysia to attract youth towards religion.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that Sufis could mediate with the general public so even if they were not a major source of conversion to Islam, as historian Mubarak Ali argues, they were capable of conversing with the ordinary public in a rural economy more than the rulers could. This gave the impression, as indicated in the detailed history of Sufism in Punjab by Surinder Singh and Ishwar Dayal Gaur, Sufis interacted well with local culture.</p>\n<p>This popularity of the Sufis was both its strength and weakness. It turned into weakness when it became institutionalised and sought after by the rulers and the ruling elite. The shrines turned into centers of both spiritual and political power with whom alliance was sought by Muslim and even non-Muslim rulers, not to mention the competition among followers vying for superiority of their saint. With growing interaction between the power centers and Sufi families, the shrines became the power centers rather than the message. Love and passion cannot be inherited.</p>\n<p><strong>The shrines</strong></p>\n<p>The patronage of Sufi shrines by power centers \u2013 starting from the Mughals and leading up to the British \u2013 weakened the institution. Dr Sarah Ansari\u2019s seminal work on pirs in Sindh lays out a picture of how the British gave hundreds and thousands of acres of land to the pirs and included them as part of the agriculturist class defined through the Alienation of Land Act 1901. The same happened in other parts of the subcontinent. To quote historian K. K. Aziz: \u201cThe British noticed this, as had the Mughals before them and the Afghans before the Mughals, and used the zamindars and the land-pir to keep the imperial harness in place\u201d.</p>\n<p>Post 1947, shrines competed for greater share and attention of their respective states. In India, shrines won the autonomy to dominate and operate in their sphere. In Pakistan and later Bangladesh, Sufi families were absorbed in power politics instead of Sufism, transforming the face of the institution into what I would call shrine-mafia. It was a class of people that were part of the elite and, in fact, represented, local power hegemony, political, economic and intellectual. They were agents of the state that interceded on behalf of both the state and the people. The more conscientious pir gave more to the masses but an inward looking one was just the opposite. If not directly in power, these \u2018spiritual landowners\u2019, that Ansari calls them, became power brokers. Shrines were where powerful people gathered and added to their patronage power or negotiated with other power centers. Thus, from Ayub Khan to Imran Khan shrines and those touting as representing the Sufi tradition have a role.</p>\n<p>But as Mian Muhammad Baksh said in Saiful Malook:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Jis yari wich lalach howay, kadey o tour naheen chardee,</em></p>\n<p><em>Chaddar leer-o-leer Muhammad, kundiyan naal jo ardi.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sufism and modernity</strong></p>\n<p>This brings me to my second point about modernity challenging the influence of the Sufi institution. This pertains to competitive ideologies emerging in the subcontinent. While the various sufi orders anchored from 12th to 18th centuries, revivalists movements also emerged from their midst represented by Sufi scholars such as Ahmed Shah Sirhindi and Shah Waliullah. Belonging to the Naqshbandi Sufi order, they not only questioned the concept of <em>wahdatul wajud</em>, but also had influence in the Arab world.</p>\n<p>Shah Waliullah, who is considered as inspiration for the Ahl-e Hadith movement, was himself trained and mentored by a Sindhi sufi scholar from the Naqshbandi order, Hayat al-Sindhi from Adilpur, Sindh. This is a critical relationship in the evolution of Sufi thought in the subcontinent as Hayat Sindhi himself was trained, initially in Thatta, but later in Medina under the tutelage of Ibrahim al-Kurani.</p>\n<p>Almost all Medinian scholars of the time were influenced by Naqshbandi-Ashari thought compounded with the desire to revive Ahmed bin Hanbal and Ibn Taimiyya. Al-Sindhi also taught Muhammad ibn abdl Wahab how the concept of shrines was antithetical to Islam. The emphasis, hence, was on both the Holy Qur\u2019an and Hadith. Sindhi was indeed a known and established <em>muhadith</em>.</p>\n<p>In the subcontinent at that time there was reaction to Akber\u2019s Din-e-Elahi, an effort to merge faiths. This was a deviation not syncretism. The resultant revivalism naturally questioned Sufi traditions that had morphed into newer forms. Ideologically, Sufism in the subcontinent, like the rest of the Muslim world had shifted from its emphasis on asceticism to pantheism and neo-Platonic influences.</p>\n<p>This influence toed and froed between the subcontinent and the Arabian peninsula to inspire the more modern ulema moments in the beginning of the 20th century. The Deobandi, Ahl-e Hadith, Barelvi and even Ahmadi movements were revivalist in nature and were embraced by a generally embattled Muslim population. While preaching greater conformism to set rules, these above-mentioned movements also catered to growing socio-economic modernity and the need to draw distinctive lines between communal cultures.</p>\n<p>Although the process of centralisation and streamlining of communal identities was started during the British, it was carried over into the new post-colonial states which needed centralisation much more. Under the circumstances, Sufism as an institution was forced to merge itself into a ulema-based Barelvi movement. What we see today is a Sufi-Barelvi hybrid.</p>\n<p>However, even this combination could not sufficiently cater to the needs of socio-economic modernity. While Pakistani sociologist Hamza Alavi was of the view that this hybrid form represented \u2018peasant\u2019s religion\u2019, he believed that this would change in terms of greater space for other identities even with changes in agricultural implements. What he meant was that a more literate middle class would seek other religious formulas. Over years, this proved true.</p>\n<p>The Sufi message was increasingly confined to rural areas where it still has traction for numerous reasons not connected with either the desire for Ishq nor an understanding of the Sufi message. This is not to argue that literate and urban people do not go to shrines but that Sufism currently lacks the narrative which socio-economic modernity demands.</p>\n<p>The new religious forms are based much more on an identifiable narrative and textual evidence. Modern Islam is also not individualistic but builds a community and a firmer identity. It is also much more egalitarian than the Sufi institution \u2013 to an ordinary mind, piri-mureedi is a struggle through an individual who is surrounded by layers of minions and khalifas, but the soldier of God and the act of martyrdom does not require intercession or negotiating patronage. A crown of jewels, 70 hooris and forgiveness for 70 pious people.</p>\n<p><strong>Modern-day Sufism</strong></p>\n<p>Let me now present my final point about the lack of narrative in South Asian Sufism. But first let me take you back to my own story that I started from regarding my research on Sufism. What I find intriguing was that wherever I went into the Sufi landscape I found faces of radicalism and terror. My question was that how could it happen in Sufi lands. It is the same question that till today baffles many of my Sindhi friends. Most won\u2019t imagine that the syncretic landscape is no more. They view extremism as an implant which is certainly the case but implants do not take time to take root if there is a demand for it. The educated Sindhi middle class, who does not get answers from shrines, now looks elsewhere. Furthermore, the political accommodation of the JUI in Sindh has contributed tremendously in shifting the goalpost.</p>\n<p>As I looked closely I realised that the Saint had merged with the Sinner and the self-styled Soldier of God. The pir had lost his capacity to bring peace to society because of his inability to introduce his own narrative.</p>\n<p>While the politics of the state has a large part to play, the fact remains that the Sufi institution in South Asia is quite moth-eaten. The state of moral and ethical degradation and internal power struggles have not only divided the shrines but also diverted attention towards other issues not related to the spirit of Sufism. Some research that I started to do but have not concluded yet, involved looking at the economic power around three shrines in South Punjab. The result was that now these centers are no longer controlled by Sufi-lovers or even Barelvis. The weaker a shrine family, the greater likelihood of Deobandi and Ahl-e Hadith control. While in other parts of South Asia such as India and Sri Lanka, the monopoly of religion by communal leaders allowed for greater exploitation of the follower, in the Islamic states of the region there was a total moral abandonment of the message by the Sufi leadership. In any case, there is moral deprivation and degradation in the shrine families which has not been captured in our literature.</p>\n<p>Politically, the pirs do not offer a counter-point. In fact, they have succumbed to the forces of religious modernity. When Lal Masjid\u2019s Maulvi Abdul Rasheed died it was the pirs of the area who were falling over backwards to lead his funeral prayers. The pirs of Khwaja Farid seek appointment from Hafiz Saeed and invite Maulana Fazlur Rehman to the Farid mela. The pir of Golra has used Deobandi militants for years to control contested land ownership. And mind you, these are not just stories from Punjab. The scene is the same wherever you go.</p>\n<p>Even in Turkey, political modernity knocked down the Sufi institution but in South Asia, particularly the Islamic states there has been a huge gap in revising the Sufi narrative to a point where there is none remaining. There are no centers of learning around shrines to ponder and educate. The modern pir did not even have the capacity to stand apart from Maulvi Khadim Rizvi, who has now, in fact, dominated the Sufi message. But let\u2019s be clear that he is not a lover and his message is not love.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I would challenge the professor from al-Azhar regarding his conclusion that Sufism can draw us back towards peace. This is a theoretical notion that is deprived of any reality. We no longer have the capacity to differentiate between the exploitative madness of the religious clerics and Sufi love. In fact, when we speak about Sufism in South Asia we are talking about shrine and shrine families. Ishq is not arrogance and what we have around us is arrogance not submission. We have no one to tell us that the idea of Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is not destruction but peace. A new narrative is needed, a new direction is needed where we could go back to understand that:</p>\n<p><em>Alif Allah, ratta dil medda, menoun bey di khabar na kaye,</em></p>\n<p><em>Bey parhiyan kujh samajh na avaay, lazzat alif de aye.\u00a0\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Ayesha Siddiqa\u00a0is a research associate at SOAS, University of London South Asia Institute and tweets as @iamthedrifter.</em></p>\n<p><em>This article <a href=\"http://www.thefridaytimes.com/tft/sinners-saints-soldiers-of-god-has-sufism-failed-to-counter-radicalism/\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"originally appeared\" >originally appeared</a> on </em>The Friday Times<em>.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/225216/changing-face-sufism-south-asia/\">The Changing Face of Sufism in South Asia</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://thewire.in/225216/changing-face-sufism-south-asia/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">225216</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>A Rare Peek Into the Revolt of 1857, the First War to Be Caught on Camera in India</title>\n\t\t<link>https://thewire.in/225060/rare-peek-revolt-1857-first-war-caught-camera-india/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://thewire.in/225060/rare-peek-revolt-1857-first-war-caught-camera-india/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 07:30:20 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Soumitra Das]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Books]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Featured]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[History]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Photography]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Abraham Alkazi]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Bahadur Shah Jafar]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Black watch]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[British India]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Cawnpore massacres]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Diwani-Khas]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Dr Tressider]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[East India Company]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[kanpur massacre]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Rosie Llewellyn Jones]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Sepoy revolt]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[The Alkazi Collection of Photography: The Uprising of 1857]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://thewire.in/?p=225060</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>'The Alkazi Collection of Photography: The Uprising of 1857', edited by London-based historian Rosie Llewellyn Jones, examines the infamous revolt, which was among the first fully photographed wars in the history of India.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/225060/rare-peek-revolt-1857-first-war-caught-camera-india/\">A Rare Peek Into the Revolt of 1857, the First War to Be Caught on Camera in India</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><em>The Alkazi Collection of Photography: The Uprising of 1857</em>, edited by London-based historian Rosie Llewellyn Jones, examines the infamous revolt, which was among the first fully photographed wars in the history of India.</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_225063\" style=\"max-width: 725px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-attachment-id=\"225063\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/225060/rare-peek-revolt-1857-first-war-caught-camera-india/5-30/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17153421/5.jpg?fit=715%2C551\" data-orig-size=\"715,551\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"5\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17153421/5.jpg?fit=300%2C231\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17153421/5.jpg?fit=715%2C551\" class=\"size-full wp-image-225063\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17153421/5.jpg?resize=715%2C551&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"715\" height=\"551\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Felice Beato took this photograph of\u00a0Humayun\u2019s Tomb in Delhi in 1858.

It examines examines the upheaval from multiple perspectives.</p>\n<p>In an interview conducted via email, the historian talks about the fascinating images:</p>\n<p><strong>Great book and great images, but why did you choose to work with the Alkazi collection of photographs alone? The book, titled 1<em>857: A Pictorial Presentation</em> published by the Indian government in 1957 to mark the centenary of the Uprising has a wider range of images culled from diverse sources. There are paintings of the Rani of Jhansi in the battlefield and of the arrest of Bahadur Shah Jafar and of the death of his sons. Of course, the 1957 book was poorly produced&#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>I was commissioned by Ebrahim Alkazi to edit the book, the last in a series showcasing various aspects of his large collection (over 90,000 images). Previous books have included the work of Raja Deen Dayal, the Delhi Coronation Durbars, and my earlier book <em>Lucknow, City of Illusion</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>How far did the lithographs and British accounts circulated in the UK deviate from the truth? To what extent were the Indians portrayed as villains and the British as knights in shining armour? Who were the consumers?</strong></p>\n<p>Many of the lithographs published in Britain, particularly those in the <em>Illustrated London News</em>, a weekly magazine, were accurate because they were engraved from photographs. It wasn\u2019t possible at the time to print magazines with photographs, so they were copied by lithographers.</p>\n<p>But two books published in England in 1858 used a mixture of lithographed photographs and some wildly imaginative sketches, in particular of the Cawnpore (now Kanpur)massacres, which have often been reproduced as genuine pictures of what actually happened. Of course no-one was sitting on the bank of the Ganges with a sketchbook, but these pictures seeped into the British subconscious. Indians were not shown as particularly villainous, but as well-armed men killing British men and women.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_225113\" style=\"max-width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18093946/16.jpg?ssl=1\"  ><img data-attachment-id=\"225113\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/225060/rare-peek-revolt-1857-first-war-caught-camera-india/16-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18093946/16.jpg?fit=1000%2C674\" data-orig-size=\"1000,674\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 5D Mark III&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1463757051&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;320&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.01&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"16\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18093946/16.jpg?fit=300%2C202\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18093946/16.jpg?fit=1000%2C674\" class=\"wp-image-225113 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18093946/16.jpg?resize=1000%2C674&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\u2018Capture of a Gun at Banda\u2019 from the book The History of the Indian Mutiny by Charles Ball, 1857.

If so, why?</strong></p>\n<p>Photographs of the Uprising were exhibited in London in 1858 to a limited audience and later published in expensive albums. The lithographs had more popular appeal. The literacy rate among British men was about 60% in the 1850s, less among women, so pictures did have a greater appeal than the written word among the lower classes.</p>\n<p><strong>There were only 100,000 British people, against a population of 250 million in the mid-1850s. What percentage of Indians collaborated with the British to quell the Uprising? How deep were the divisions of caste, religion and class among Indians?</strong></p>\n<p>Obviously if the majority of Indians had opposed the British, then the East India Company would have been finished immediately. The fact that they didn\u2019t means that a greater proportion of Indians were prepared to tolerate, and in some cases to welcome, British rule. Baniyas in particular supported the British because they had provided stable conditions for trade. The Bombay and Madras Presidency armies did not mutiny because the army provided them with a decent profession and a pension when they retired. Divisions among Indians were deep, not so much religious, as tribal, particularly in the villages. The sepoys who rebelled had no overall plan or concerted leadership \u2013 if they had marched on Kolkata (Calcutta then) and stormed Government House, the seat of British power, they would have won. But they didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p><strong>More than the destruction of Indian monuments, John Robertson Turnbull\u2019s asymmetric drawing of the majestic Diwani-Khas turned into an officers\u2019 mess represents a greater symbolic desecration of all that Indians uphold as sacred. Do you feel the same way?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, it\u2019s a pretty shocking picture, and so is the looting of the Qaisarbagh palace in Lucknow when the British and Gurkhas recaptured the city.</p>\n<p><strong>How did Felice Beato \u201cdramatise\u201d his famous photographs of the aftermath of the Uprising?</strong></p>\n<p>A lot of research has gone into this particular image. We know the corpses weren\u2019t there in November 1857 because they had been cleared away after the fighting in Sikanderbagh. But then they reappear in March 1858 when Beato photographs them. I think they were simply walled up in a room in Sikanderbagh during the winter and Beato had them brought out for his photographs, before they were finally buried in a trench in front of the Sikanderbagh gateway. We know Beato later had corpses \u2018arranged\u2019 for some of his Chinese photographs.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_225117\" style=\"max-width: 710px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18094434/4.jpg?ssl=1\"  ><img data-attachment-id=\"225117\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/225060/rare-peek-revolt-1857-first-war-caught-camera-india/4-35/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18094434/4.jpg?fit=700%2C581\" data-orig-size=\"700,581\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 5D Mark III&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1464197495&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;320&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.01&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18094434/4.jpg?fit=300%2C249\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18094434/4.jpg?fit=700%2C581\" class=\"size-full wp-image-225117\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18094434/4.jpg?resize=700%2C581&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Felice Beato's \u2018Mosque Picket\u2019 [Chauburja Mosque], Delhi from the album Mutiny Sites and Europe.

Material is turning up all the time, a lot of it still in private hands in Britain. Very little in India though.</p>\n<p><strong>Kolkata, or Calcutta, was the capital of India then, and one of the triggers of the upheaval was the execution of Mangal Pandey in Barrackpore. How did Calcutta remain unscathed?</strong></p>\n<p>Mangal Pandey was tried by a jury consisting mainly of Indian officers who found him guilty and hanged him. It was done quickly and there were no repercussions in Calcutta \u2013 it was considered an army, not a civilian matter.</p>\n<p><strong>Did peasants and Dalits join the Uprising?</strong></p>\n<p>The term Dalit wasn\u2019t known then, but certainly all kinds of people supported the soldiers fighting the British. Some had old scores to settle over land rights, and in some cases, villagers fought their neighbours, instead of joining together and fighting the British.</p>\n<p><strong>Did much of the precious booty from pillaged cities find its way to the museums of the UK?</strong></p>\n<p>Not a huge amount. The British and Gurkha looters generally preferred cash, so they sold their loot. Certainly in Britain it was said that a number of retired officers were able to pay off their mortgages with cash that they got from selling stolen booty.</p>\n<p><strong>How many professional and amateur photographers recorded the aftermath of the Uprising in India?</strong></p>\n<p>The only \u2018professional\u2019 photographer was Felice Beato, but there were a number of amateurs, including Dr Tressider of Cawnpore. A number of Europeans and Indians took up photography as a hobby, not a profession.</p>\n<p><strong>Who were the bearded Highlanders who struck the fear of god after British women and children were butchered in Kanpur?</strong></p>\n<p>They are called the Black Watch, a Highland Regiment, and they were photographed by Dr Tressider in Cawnpore. Pretty scary, aren\u2019t they?</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_225115\" style=\"max-width: 479px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18094359/2.jpg?ssl=1\"  ><img data-attachment-id=\"225115\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/225060/rare-peek-revolt-1857-first-war-caught-camera-india/2-51/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18094359/2.jpg?fit=1000%2C1078\" data-orig-size=\"1000,1078\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 5D Mark III&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1464286903&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;320&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.01&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18094359/2.jpg?fit=278%2C300\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18094359/2.jpg?fit=950%2C1024\" class=\"wp-image-225115\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18094359/2.jpg?resize=469%2C505&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\u2018Black Watch\u2019 from the Tresidder Album.

William Russell had already covered the Crimean War, as one of the first war correspondents, so it made sense to send him to India.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is so little seen of the paintings of Egron Lundgren who was sent to India by Queen Victoria to document the Uprising?</strong></p>\n<p>Most of Lundgren\u2019s paintings have been dispersed \u2013 in England to the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle, the British Library, London, the V&amp;A Museum London, the Royal Academy, Copenhagen, and other museums in Sweden. He is a master artist and it is high time someone did a major exhibition on him.</p>\n<p><strong>What roles did maps play in helping the British to plan their strategies against the Indians up in arms?</strong></p>\n<p>Obviously a huge part. The East India Company was very keen on mapping and surveying, for the simple reason that they needed to know where they were going, particularly on military expeditions. Susan Gole, the best-known authority on Indian maps, has written an excellent chapter with many previously unknown, but very relevant maps, particularly of Cawnpore and Lucknow.</p>\n<p><strong>How did the British whitewash the savage retribution that followed the upheaval?</strong></p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t. Retribution was considered quite just in the face of the Indian uprising. It was Queen Victoria who called a stop to the killings in her Proclamation of November 1858, which marks the formal end of the Uprising. She proclaimed that only Indians who were known to have murdered Britons would be punished. The rest were pardoned, the East India Company was abolished, and the British government in India then pursued a much more liberal agenda for the next 90 years until Independence.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://thewire.in/author/soumitra-das/\"  title=\"Soumitra Das\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Soumitra Das</a>,\u00a0a Kolkata-based journalist, writes on culture and the city\u2019s built heritage.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/225060/rare-peek-revolt-1857-first-war-caught-camera-india/\">A Rare Peek Into the Revolt of 1857, the First War to Be Caught on Camera in India</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://thewire.in/225060/rare-peek-revolt-1857-first-war-caught-camera-india/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">225060</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Tripura Assembly Elections: Polling Begins Amid High Security</title>\n\t\t<link>https://thewire.in/225160/tripura-assembly-elections-polling-begins-amid-high-security/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://thewire.in/225160/tripura-assembly-elections-polling-begins-amid-high-security/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 06:06:05 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[PTI]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[BJP]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[CPI(M)]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Indigenous People\u2019s Front of Tripura]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[no-donate-link]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ramendra Narayan Deb Barma]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tripura assembly elections]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tripura elections]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://thewire.in/?p=225160</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Voting is being held in 59 of the total 60 seats due to the death of the CPI(M) candidate for the Charilam constituency six days ago. </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/225160/tripura-assembly-elections-polling-begins-amid-high-security/\">Tripura Assembly Elections: Polling Begins Amid High Security</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_225183\" style=\"max-width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18113402/tripura-election-pti.jpg?ssl=1\"  ><img data-attachment-id=\"225183\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/225160/tripura-assembly-elections-polling-begins-amid-high-security/tripura-election-pti/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18113402/tripura-election-pti.jpg?fit=650%2C400\" data-orig-size=\"650,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"tripura-election-pti\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18113402/tripura-election-pti.jpg?fit=300%2C185\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18113402/tripura-election-pti.jpg?fit=650%2C400\" class=\"size-full wp-image-225183\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18113402/tripura-election-pti.jpg?resize=650%2C400&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Representative image.

In this respect, his story is different from that of Vajpayee\u2019s.

Ordinarily, losing by-elections is not the end of the world, although ruling parties frequently coast to easy victories in them. However, the BJP lost every one of the 16 Assembly segments that make up the Lok Sabha constituencies of Alwar and Ajmer.</p>\n<p>That is a lot of territory to lose in one go and should be a distinct worry for the saffron party. Rajasthan has an old and active RSS network, which in recent times was lubricated through political and social actions of the Hindutva variety, most notably cow vigilante actions. But none of this counted with the voter.</p>\n<p>The \u201csecular\u201d realm \u2013 jobs, prices, the economy, living conditions \u2013 trumped the world of perverse ideas delivered slickly through clever propaganda disseminated not just by fanatical Hindutva outfits but also a section of the fawning media.</p>\n<p>Assembly elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhatisgarh are due in December this year and the Lok Sabha poll should in the normal course be held in April-May, 2019. However, when the prognosis for the BJP in these states is none too bright \u2013 and remember the bad news began to pour in from Modi\u2019s the home state Gujarat, where BJP\u2019s win was so tenuous that the party cannot even celebrate it \u2013 and the Rajasthan results hammered home a bitter truth, can the prime minister risk holding the Lok Sabha election after a potentially weak showing in three BJP-ruled states?</p>\n<p>This will be the singular consideration guiding the prime minister if he decides to go to the country early, not some high-intentioned thinking on the presumed benefits to the country of holding parliament and state polls simultaneously.</p>\n<p>The year 2017 began brilliantly for Modi and Amit Shah with a staggering win in Uttar Pradesh. But the year ended on a sobering note on account of the factors that became evident first in Gujarat and then in Rajasthan \u2013 rampant joblessness, farmers\u2019 plight, the woes of the working classes in the \u2018rurban\u2019 areas and in cities proper.

It takes place against the backdrop of Trump\u2019s sabre-rattling on Iran and <a href=\"https://thewire.in/209524/iran-anti-government-protests-hit-tehran-two-demonstrators-reported-killed/\"  title=\"recent domestic protests against price rise\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent domestic protests against price rise</a> within the West Asian nation.</p>\n<p>In toto, <a href=\"http://www.mea.gov.in/bilateral-documents.htm?dtl/29494/List+of+MoUsAgreements+signed+during+the+visit+of+President+of+Iran+to+India+February+17+2018\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"nine agreements\" >nine agreements</a> were signed, which included a pact with an Indian company to take over interim operations at Chabahar port for the next 18 months. India also expressed support for construction of a railway line from Chabahar to Zahedan on the Iran-Afghan border, a project that has been on the anvil for several years now.</p>\n<p>Rouhani began his visit to India from Hyderabad, where he offered Friday prayers at the city\u2019s main historic mosque and visited tombs of the Qutub Shahi dynasty. In New Delhi, he had a series of meeting with the Indian leadership, but his only extensive political remarks were at a lecture organised by the Observer Research Foundation think tank on Saturday evening.</p>\n<p>He used the platform to lash out at the US for threatening to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and bemoaned the lack of ethics in the conduct of international relations.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur destiny was in the hands of the United States for a long time. They would decide not just our economy but our culture,\u201d said Rouhani, who had already been conscripted in the military at the time of the Iranian Revolution. He noted that the sole educational channel in pre-revolution Iran was run by \u201c36 Americans\u201d and said that the last Shah of Iran ran the country with the help of the US ambassador.</p>\n<p>Rouhani narrated how there were areas in the military bases that were off-limits for Iranians. \u201cThere were so many closed doors\u2026When I asked to open a door, they [the officials] were afraid as they had never entered the hall\u201d.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, he spent a considerable portion of his speech on the importance of adhering to contracts. The Iranian president even linked it to religious practice, asserting that the holy book urged Muslims to keep their word. \u201cIf we have made a deal, entered a contract, we will follow it to our death\u201d.</p>\n<p>Speaking about \u201cperfidy\u201d of other countries in breaking commitments, he first mentioned former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein for violating the 1975 border agreement with Iran. Rouhani then digressed into the role of the US in supporting Hussein, claiming that intelligence gathered by the US AWACS hovering over Iran were supplied to Iraq.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me give you another example of betrayal,\u201d Rouhani said, as he started to offer his views on Trump\u2019s crusade against the <a href=\"https://thewire.in/213386/ultimatum-issued-by-trump-to-fix-iran-nuclear-deal/\"  title=\"Iran nuclear deal\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Iran nuclear deal</a>.</p>\n<p>The US\u2019s threat to withdraw from the agreement was not just against Iran, but also other signatories, the United Nations Security Council and \u201cpublic opinion of the world\u201d, he asserted.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026we will stay on board,\u201d said the Iranian president in reference to the 2016 nuclear deal signed between Iran and six other countries. He, however, added that his country had adhered to contracts signed with other nations who have followed the terms and conditions.</p>\n<p>President Trump had argued even during his campaign that he could have got a better deal with Iran than the JCPOA which was signed in 2016.</p>\n<p>In January, Trump warned European nations that unless the deal was tweaked to curb Iran\u2019s missile development programme, he won\u2019t waive off sanctions next time as per schedule in May.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>Also read</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"https://thewire.in/39583/india-and-iran-roads-matter-trade-matters-more/?utm_source=alsoread\"  title=\"D.P.

After signing a deal, haggling is ridiculous,\u201d said Rouhani, addressing an audience of members of Delhi\u2019s diplomatic community, foreign policy experts, journalists and retired bureaucrats.</p>\n<p>Directly criticising Trump, he said, \u201cA businessman who has been haggling all his life does not know when to stop\u2026. He thinks that he can haggle any time\u201d.</p>\n<p>He warned that Trump\u2019s plan to withdraw from the deal would be a self-inflicted wound. \u201cIf the US violates this agreement, you will see that America will regret its decision.

And four other countries also\u2026 Those who had atomic bombs have been given veto rights\u201d.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rouhani\u2019s remarks were in the context of the double standards in the international system, claiming that powerful countries were able to exploit the international system without following \u201cethical standards\u201d. Iran has been a frequent target of the Security Council and certainly not a votary of veto power. Therefore, in that context, Iran president\u2019s reference to India not having veto rights was a rhetorical phrase and certainly not a endorsement of India&#8217;s quest for permanent seat on the UNSC <a href=\"http://ptinews.com/news/9501353_Iran-will-adhere-to-nuclear-deal-till-last-breath--Rouhani\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"as some outlets mistakenly reported\" >as some outlets mistakenly reported</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Backing for a India\u2019s permanent membership ambitions is always a major highlight for Indian officials during any foreign visit and would have been mentioned by Indian officials if indeed that is what Rouhani meant.\u00a0 Significantly, there was no mention of any such endorsement at the MEA briefing.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further, in the joint statement, the Iranian leader only endorsed the importance of reforming the United Nations Security Council to show &#8220;current geopolitical realities&#8221; and supported inter-governmental negotiations \u2013 but stopped short of any explicit backing of India\u2019s bid to become a permanent member.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two leaders exchanged views on regional and international situation. In view of strengthening multilateralism, President Rouhani acknowledges the aspiration of India to play a greater role in international fora.\u00a0The two leaders reiterated the importance of strong United Nations and emphasised the need for an early reform of the Security Council reflective of the current geopolitical realities. They reaffirmed their commitment to supporting the Intergovernmental Negotiations [IGN] for comprehensive reform of the Security Council.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Rouhani on terrorism</strong></p>\n<p>On terrorism, both leaders urged an \u201cimmediate end to all support and sanctuaries enjoyed by terrorist groups and individuals and were of the view that states that aid, abet and directly or indirectly support terrorism should be condemned\u201d. Calling on the international community to end \u201cselective of partial approaches to combating terrorism\u201d, Rouhani and Modi also \u201cstressed the need to make every effort to reach an agreement on and conclude a comprehensive convention on international terrorism at the UNGA\u201d.</p>\n<p>In his speech, the Iranian president had accused Washington of being the phantom force behind ISIS. \u201cThey [the ISIS] were a great instrument for the US to play with a long time\u2026 We have the documents\u201d.</p>\n<p>Significantly, both countries agreed to hold a dialogue to look into measures for defence cooperation, \u201cincluding port calls by naval ships, training and regular exchanges of defence delegations\u201d.</p>\n<p>On Afghanistan, they supported a \u201cstrong, united, prosperous, pluralistic, democratic and independent Afghanistan while supporting the National Unity Government in the country\u201d.</p>\n<p>Even as the Chabahar port was being projected as the panacea for Afghanistan\u2019s trade woes, Iran supported New Delhi and Kabul\u2019s demand for Pakistan to open its land route to allow two-way trade from India. \u201cIn this context, they also called upon the countries of the region to come forward for enhancing regional connectivity and take steps to do away with the obstacles on land transit,\u201d said the joint statement.</p>\n<p>According to the Ministry of External Affairs, a running theme of Rouhani&#8217;s visit was the completion of pending agreements.

He said he wanted to smooth the way for reforms.</p>\n<p>A day later, the government imposed the<span class=\"highlight\"> state </span>of<span class=\"highlight\"> emergency</span>. Parliament \u2013 where the four-party ruling coalition controls all 547 seats \u2013 is expected to ratify it within two weeks.</p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\">Ethiopia </span>is East Africa&#8217;s biggest and fastest-growing economy and a Western ally in the fight against Islamist militancy. But rights groups often criticise the government for clamping down on political opponents and the media.</p>\n<p>The US, a major aid donor, said it &#8220;strongly disagreed&#8221; with the decision to call for\u00a0<span class=\"highlight\">emergency </span>rule.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We recognise and share concerns expressed by the government about incidents of violence and loss of life, but firmly believe that the answer is greater freedom, not less,&#8221; the US embassy in Addis Ababa said in<span class=\"highlight\"> state</span>ment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The declaration of a<span class=\"highlight\"> state </span>of<span class=\"highlight\"> emergency </span>undermines recent positive steps toward creating a more inclusive political space, including the release of thousands of prisoners,&#8221; it added.</p>\n<p>Since January,<span class=\"highlight\"> Ethiopia </span>has released more than 6,000 prisoners charged with a variety of offences, including taking part in mass protests and crimes against the<span class=\"highlight\"> state</span>. It has also closed down a jail where activists alleged torture took place.</p>\n<p>Many of the prisoners took part in anti-government protests in 2015 and 2016 in the country&#8217;s two most populous provinces, whose ethnic Oromo and Amharic communities complain they are under-represented in the country&#8217;s corridors of power.</p>\n<p>The demonstrations began against a government plan to expand the capital Addis Ababa but then morphed into greater demands for civil rights.</p>\n<p>The government previously imposed a<span class=\"highlight\"> state </span>of<span class=\"highlight\"> emergency </span>in October 2016, which was lifted in August 2017.

In the absence of compulsory and random inspection, companies spend less on health and safety equipment and provisions\u2026 Evidence also indicates that companies do not invest adequately in skilling workers and in health and safety training. This is more so the case as companies rely on contract workers to further increase their profits\u2026 The CSL\u2019s Red Herring Prospectus says that \u2018instead of maintaining a large number of full-time employees, we employ a significant number of contract labour\u2019 including through sub-contractors. This is despite the fact that the CSL recognises as a \u2018risk\u2019 that \u2018sub-contractors use poor quality sub-components or under qualified or less skilled workers\u2019. In light of this, the enquiry into the accident ordered by the Ministry of Shipping and the Directorate of Factories and Boilers would merely pass on the blame to the sub-contractor.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>7 million jobs in FY18?

Sources familiar with the developments say that even the EPFO was not fully aware that its employment data would be used by somebody outside the government system.\u201d The report was described as an academic study and did not mention that it has been presented to the PMO four days before being made public. <em>Business Standard</em> also claims that the entire exercise was \u201ctriggered by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO), which had asked the NITI Aayog last October to give \u201cquick indicators for direct or indirect reflections on employment data\u201d to be able to arrive at \u201cdesired trends in employment at the earliest.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Three days, twelve deaths: No end to manual scavenging</strong></p>\n<p>All claims to India\u2019s scientific and engineering prowess aside, India has failed to find a true solution to manual scavenging. Leaving aside the issue of human dignity and entrenched casteism of the occupation, the death toll alone should have been a call to action. Yet, as a society, we have become numb to the grave issue with our administration becoming adept at post accident compensation rather than prevention. <em>The News Minute</em> <a href=\"https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/no-value-these-lives-manual-scavenging-claims-3-more-tn-hotel-76469\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"has tracked\" >has tracked</a> three deaths in Kanchepuram, two workers&#8217;\u00a0deaths\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/no-end-b-lurus-manual-scavenging-deaths-2-workers-die-restaurant-septic-tank-76420?amp\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"in Bangalore\" >in Bangalore</a> and seven deaths near Chittor <a href=\"https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/seven-workers-killed-manual-scavenging-incident-andhra-no-arrests-yet-76565?amp\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"in Andhra Pradesh\" >in Andhra Pradesh</a>.

The estimated 1.3 million migrant workers in the city form an overwhelming one-sixth of its population and provide the cheap labour which fuels the remarkable growth of its manufacturing, hotel and construction sector.

This will allow UAE to access the contracts under which Indian workers are recruited by foreign companies to work in the Emirates. Any violation of the contractual obligations will enable Indian workers to take legal recourse. The eMigrate process mandates foreign companies interested in recruiting blue collar (emigration check required) workers from India to apply through the digital system. Already over 2 lakh workers have been hired through this system. The linkage with UAE is to be set up in the next three to four months. &#8220;The problem that is so endemic is of contract substitution. Somebody gets a contract of Dh 2,000 and come here and finds that they are getting only Dh1,500. This will end. We do want a maximum of workers to come through the e-migrate system because that enables them a degree of protection. And once we integrate that into the UAE system, then it really does make a quantum leap in terms of protecting the rights of our workers,&#8221; said Navdeep Singh Suri, India\u2019s envoy to UAE.

All six workers were office bearers of the newly formed union at the company. The District Court, while maintaining that the police cannot play a partisan role in a labour dispute, granted bail to the arrested workers and extended a partial anticipatory bail to other workers until the February 20. The bail application of Dinesh, president of the newly formed union, is still pending. The union was in the process of submitting a charter of demands that included a rise in salaries. The workers allege that the management transferred five workers after the union was formed, forcing them to engage in protest against unfair labour practices. The police, taking advantage of a High Court injunction against protests within 100 meters of the factory gate, arrested the leaders.</p>\n<p><strong>International </strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Netherlands to investigate \u2018Deliveroo\u2019 for unfair labour practice</strong></p>\n<p>The Dutch government <a href=\"http://www.uniglobalunion.org/news/success-deliveroo-riders-netherlands-strike-action-forces-investigation\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"has launched a full-scale investigation\" >has launched a full-scale investigation</a> into one of the dark sides of the gig economy &#8211; the strategy of employing workers on bogus self-employment contracts despite working full time for a company, like Uber or Deliveroo.

Physicians organised a sit-in at the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza strip Monday morning, calling for meeting the demands of striking workers. The health ministry spokesman in Gaza said that operation rooms in the hospitals were completely paralysed due to the accumulation of dirt and rubbish in the hospitals for the second day in a row.</p>\n<p><strong>Weekend reading </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Agricultural Workers suffer the cost of Aadhar Mess Ups</strong></p>\n<p>Poor, underpaid agricultural workers in India are bearing the brunt of India\u2019s experiment with digitisation and financial inclusion. A <a href=\"https://ruralindiaonline.org/articles/aadhaar-robs-lakshmi-of-wealth\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"report from PARI\" >report from PARI</a> recounts how mess ups in Aadhar-MNRGES linking have led to a number of workers unable to access their hard-earned wages from the employment guarantee scheme. The article says that nearly 700 MGNREGA workers in Munagapaka \u2013 a village with a population of around 10,000 \u2013 are collectively waiting for Rs. 10 lakhs in wages since April 2015, And 294 labourers of Ganaparthi, a village with a population of around 2,200, are yet to receive more than Rs. 4 lakhs. From mix-ups between bank accounts to problems with biometric verification and linking process, digitisation is throwing up a number of glitches that are far too costly for the impoverished workers who depend on these wages to make ends meet.</p>\n<p><strong>Doubling farm incomes: mechanisms and challenges</strong></p>\n<p>PM Modi had promised a doubling of farm incomes by 2022 as part of BJP\u2019s election manifesto in 2014.

Whether it was a gritty reminder of the reality of climate disruption or merely a sign of disease, it was certainly proof of how images can stir us much more than lifeless data.\u00a0But the viral video was also unusual. It is more common for nature videos to lift our spirits with magnificent sights than to try and shake us out of our complacency about the state of the environment.</p>\n<p>Nature documentaries have been bringing the wild into our living rooms since the 1960s. They take us to remote regions of the planet, and imprint in our minds an idea of the state of the natural world. At a time of environmental crisis, they continue to show images of unspoilt natural splendour. It can be said that this will make urban men and women love and want to protect it and sensitise them to environmental degradation. Yet it may be that the jungle in our living rooms only gives us a false impression of nature as an abundant resource, and deepens our environmental ignorance.</p>\n<p>We have come a long way from Disney\u2019s 1958 <em>Wild Wilderness</em> documentary, where filmmakers drove scores of lemmings off a cliff to prove the legend that they committed mass suicide (and the film won an Oscar). The huge success of the big budget blue chip format started with Disney\u2019s <em>True Life Adventure</em> films (1948-1960). It led the BBC Natural History Unit, which incorporated a scrupulous scientific approach, to bring us marvellous and inspiring visions of the natural world. It gave us a peek into the lives in the wild and into the dizzying diversity of nature. The darker issue of environmental degradation, however, stayed on the fringe.</p>\n<p>Chris Palmer has produced more than 300 hours of nature programming. In 2011, he published a book, <em>Shooting in the Wild</em>, that described how commonly wildlife films use fakery \u2013 using animals from game farms, inserting fraudulent sound, shooting small animals and birds on sets, using computer graphics and more. \u201cAnd if you see a bear feeding on a deer carcass in a film,\u201d Palmer <a href=\"https://www.documentary.org/magazine/wild-ethically-nature-filmmakers-need-code-conduct\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"writes\" >writes</a>, \u201cit is almost certainly a tame bear searching for hidden jellybeans in the entrails of the deer&#8217;s stomach.\u201d Many films use \u2018wildlife casting agencies\u2019, like the company Animals of Montana, whose website lists National Geographic, IMAX, Animal Planet and the BBC Natural History Unit among its clients.</p>\n<p>Even BBC, with its high standards of filmmaking, has been accused of routinely faking footage and using studio sets and sound effects to portray animals in the wild. In 2011, the media in Britain was scandalised to learn about scenes faked for David Attenborough\u2019s <em>Frozen Planet</em>. A polar bear, shown as giving birth in the wild, was actually a bear in fake snow inside a Dutch zoo. <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/frozen-planet-scandal-sir-david-96593\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"The Mirror fumed\" ><em>The Mirror</em> fumed</a> over how Attenborough defended the footage by comparing documentaries to movies: \u201cThe dodgy footage was the most touching scene in Episode Five of Frozen Planet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Way back in 1997, the award-winning filmmaker Steven Mills <a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/pocket-tigers/\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"lamented\" >lamented</a> that \u201cthe loss of wilderness is a truth so sad, so overwhelming that, to reflect reality, it would need to be the subject of every wildlife film. That, of course, would be neither entertaining nor ultimately dramatic. So it seems that as filmmakers we are doomed either to fail our audience or fail our cause.\u201d</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that most wildlife and nature documentary makers feel passionately for nature. For those of us who have been in forests know how difficult it is to see an animal, let aside see it in action. And then not just the patience but the budgets start running out, too.\u00a0\u201cIf someone wants to make a film on breeding birds of Keoladeo National Park, two to three months will be sufficient,\u201d says Asad Rahmani, a former director of the Bombay Natural History Society. \u201cBut if you are making a film on a rare species or a species that does not show up quickly or is very shy, it will take years.\u201d Shooting wildlife documentaries is a lot of hard work and genuine wildlife action shots are hard earned.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_225017\" style=\"max-width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/16231629/1_waxlake_A.jpg?ssl=1\"  ><img data-attachment-id=\"225017\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/225011/jungle-living-rooms/1_waxlake_a/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/16231629/1_waxlake_A.jpg?fit=2048%2C1536\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"1_waxlake_A\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Does this place really exist?

The change in approach came about when the media as a whole began to acknowledge and address the environmental crisis. Attenborough\u2019s <em>The State of the Planet</em> marked a new awareness on the BBC. In place of blue-chip, green-chip programming made its presence felt with films like <em>The Truth About Climate Change</em> (2006), <em>Saving Planet Earth</em> (2007) and\u00a0<em>Last Chance to See</em> (2009).</p>\n<p>Discovery, which had partnered with BBC to produce <em>Frozen Planet</em>, is said to have objected to Attenborough\u2019s warnings about the dangers of climate change, since a large part of the US population is in denial about climate change. (It had also objected to his reference to contraception in <em>The Life of Mammals</em> (2002), as it did not want to not ruffle conservative audiences in the US). The BBC and Sir David eventually prevailed. Attenborough, unshackled by the will of producers, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/earthnews/9815862/Humans-are-plague-on-Earth-Attenborough.html\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"expressed his thoughts\" >expressed his thoughts</a> on Radio Times in 2013: \u201cWe are a plague on the earth. It\u2019s coming home to roost over the next 50 years or so. It\u2019s not just climate change; it\u2019s sheer space, places to grow food for this enormous horde.\u201d</p>\n<p>On nature channels we still watch with awe the endless, untouched expanse of the rainforests; expensive footage of a parallel universe of unspoilt and profuse ecosystems, with wild animals aplenty, roaming free and undisturbed. It is a false image. It doesn\u2019t show us the inconvenient pictures of the deteriorating environment.\u00a0Today, where nature is most abundant is television.</p>\n<p><strong>Flatter and destroy</strong></p>\n<p>In reality, we are facing <a href=\"https://thewire.in/159315/sixth-mass-extinction-range-loss-iucn/\"  title=\"the sixth age of extinction\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the sixth age of extinction</a> on this planet \u2013 the last one was the dinosaurs \u2013 and the single largest cause is human activity. Nature programming feeds a utopian delusion that pristine nature still exists in abundance \u2013 and contributes to our apathy. Huge budgets and clever editing hide the inconvenient picture of threatened wild species and degraded ecosystems. They make it easier for governments and businesses to paint environmental activism as misplaced and anti-development.</p>\n<p>An honest representation of the issues and the condition of ecosystems does not mean films can\u2019t offer inspiration and give hope as well. Mike Pandey\u2019s new documentary, <em>Gyamo: Queen of the Mountains</em>, confronts viewers with the destruction of the habitat of one of the most endangered cats, <a href=\"https://thewire.in/41248/snow-leopard-video/\"  title=\"the snow leopard\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the snow leopard</a>. It is an excellent example of how spectacular footage from the Himalayas can be balanced with unsettling images of heaps of plastic debris left by tourists in one of Earth\u2019s most pristine biomes.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1160' height='683' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/I_zRjSYkaTc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></div>\n<p>Yet television and broadcasting technology largely continues to be an aide to masking the unprecedented scale of environmental destruction of the last half-century. It has done that by cinematically evading a reality of nature headed into ruin.

The event, which lasted nearly two hours, saw the prime minister taking questions from students in the audience and from around the country, answering them in his avuncular manner, and peppering the interaction with anecdotes from his own life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was, of course, clear that here was yet another scripted and orchestrated event. The chaos that comes with a spontaneous question-and-answer session \u2013 specially with teenagers \u2013 was conspicuous by its absence. What we saw instead were rows of high school children sitting up straight, paying attention and applauding at all the right times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Early on in the interaction, Modi credited his teachers for helping him \u201cremain in learning mode and always keep[ing] the student within alive\u201d. One would have to admit he has certainly learnt a thing or two about interacting with students since his first Teachers\u2019 Day interaction with the country four years ago. (That event, it may be recalled, was mandatory viewing for school children around the country.) Doing away with much of the formality this time, the PM walked around on stage, relaxed and easy, much like a speaker at a TED event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That much strategising and preparation had gone into the event was obvious by the fact that for several hours on the day the event occurred, Google\u2019s home page featured a link right beneath the search bar pointing to a YouTube recording of the event.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_225100\" style=\"max-width: 567px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-attachment-id=\"225100\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/225097/school-children-need-re-modeled-education-system-not-tips-crack-exams-mr-pm/screenshot-2018-02-16-18-06-23/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17192002/Screenshot-2018-02-16-18.06.23.png?fit=846%2C602\" data-orig-size=\"846,602\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screenshot-2018-02-16-18.06.23\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17192002/Screenshot-2018-02-16-18.06.23.png?fit=300%2C213\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17192002/Screenshot-2018-02-16-18.06.23.png?fit=846%2C602\" class=\"wp-image-225100\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17192002/Screenshot-2018-02-16-18.06.23.png?resize=557%2C396&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"557\" height=\"396\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Screenshot of Google\u2019s home page that featured a link right beneath the search bar pointing to a YouTube recording of the PM&#8217;s event.</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While much of what the prime minister shared with the students was hardly new wisdom (rest, focus, do yoga, don\u2019t compare yourself with others, etc.) there were eyebrow-raising moments in his interaction as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he exhorted students to honour their teachers, and teachers to build relationships with the students and their families, Modi also unwittingly voiced a long-standing societal condescension towards the teaching profession while answering a question about parental pressure: \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe reason a parent puts pressure on his students,\u201d he said, \u201cis because of the ghost of unmet expectations. For example, a parent wanted to become a doctor but ended up becoming a teacher. That parent will then force his child to become a doctor.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ended up becoming a teacher</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">! Surely an unfortunate choice of words, given that hundreds of thousands of teachers were watching the event along with their students and that just a few kilometers away<a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/huge-turnout-at-dutas-shiksha-bachao-rally/article22779149.ece\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\" teachers and students were protesting\" > teachers and students were protesting</a> his government\u2019s education policies on Parliament Street.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While one is glad that the prime minister encouraged students not to stress too much, get enough rest and not compare themselves with each other, some of what he said was downright bewildering, for example, his definitions of IQ and EQ. IQ he likened to a baby who can reach for a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ghungroo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on his own after his mother has tapped it once, and EQ was compared to the same baby being soothed by its mother\u2019s voice. (Both IQ and EQ, incidentally, have precise definitions. IQ </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a total score derived from several\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_test\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"standardised tests\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">standardised tests</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0designed to assess\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_intelligence\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"human intelligence\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">human intelligence</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EQ consists of a person\u2019s self-awareness, ability to self-regulate, empathize and build relations with others.) </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Modi\u2019s references to war in his interaction were also worrying. While talking about the tendency of students to compare themselves with each other, the prime minister exhorted them to stay in their own \u2018field of ability\u2019 and not venture out into other fields, much like how \u201cin a war you bring the enemy into your own field and kill him.\u201d Should a prime minister use war metaphors in a chat with young students? Was this a metaphor loosely used or was it a deliberately casual reference, aimed perhaps at valourising conflict?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The prime minister also exhorted the students to build \u201ca free and open atmosphere\u201d at home and even encouraged a student to take up journalism as a career. One wonders what kind of a journalist he had in mind, given the fact that India has now slipped to 136</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> place in the World Press Freedom Index and the National Investigation Agency\u2019s view is that journalists have a \u201cmoral duty\u201d to report the positive work of the government and that if they don\u2019t, their credentials will always be suspect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peter Drucker, \u2018father of modern management\u2019 once said, \u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Management is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; leadership determines whether the ladder is leaning against the right wall.\u201d What Indian education needs more than anything is a leader who will take a good long hard look at the education system as a whole and have the courage to overhaul it. That is what the people of India want their prime minister to do, not waste his energies proffering advice that is readily available in dozens of self-help books. There are others who can help students crack their exams. There is no one else to do the job of ensuring India has a well-functioning, designed and resourced education system that can produce outcomes in terms of actual learning rather than exam results.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rohit Kumar is an educator.</span></i></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/225097/school-children-need-re-modeled-education-system-not-tips-crack-exams-mr-pm/\">School Children Need a Re-Modeled Education System, Not Tips to Crack Exams, Mr PM</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://thewire.in/225097/school-children-need-re-modeled-education-system-not-tips-crack-exams-mr-pm/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>3</slash:comments>\n\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">225097</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>How 21 Artists Famously Graffitied a Man\u2019s Property, Sued Him When He Knocked It Down and Won $6.7m</title>\n\t\t<link>https://thewire.in/225049/graffiti-jerry-wolkolff-5pointz-new-york/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://thewire.in/225049/graffiti-jerry-wolkolff-5pointz-new-york/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 03:00:27 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Enrico Bonadio]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Art]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Cities & Architecture]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[5Pointz]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Banksy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[graffiti]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Jerry Wolkoff]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Meres One]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[New York]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[no-donate-link]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Phun Factory]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[property development]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[queens]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[street art]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[VARA]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://thewire.in/?p=225049</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>In a landmark court decision in New York, graffiti has been ruled to be proper art worthy of recognition and protection.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in/225049/graffiti-jerry-wolkolff-5pointz-new-york/\">How 21 Artists Famously Graffitied a Man\u2019s Property, Sued Him When He Knocked It Down and Won $6.7m</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thewire.in\">The Wire</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>In a landmark court decision in New York, graffiti has been ruled to be proper art worthy of recognition and protection.</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_225054\" style=\"max-width: 1366px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-attachment-id=\"225054\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/225049/graffiti-jerry-wolkolff-5pointz-new-york/file-20180215-130997-yjgedt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17125510/file-20180215-130997-yjgedt.jpg?fit=1356%2C668\" data-orig-size=\"1356,668\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"file-20180215-130997-yjgedt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17125510/file-20180215-130997-yjgedt.jpg?fit=300%2C148\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17125510/file-20180215-130997-yjgedt.jpg?fit=1024%2C504\" class=\"size-full wp-image-225054\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17125510/file-20180215-130997-yjgedt.jpg?resize=1160%2C571&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1160\" height=\"571\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit: Nigel Morris/Flickr, CC BY-SA</p></div>\n<p>It\u2019s an extraordinary tale with a whiff of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/jul/17/art.artsfeatures\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"Banksy\" >Banksy</a> about it, although surprisingly, he was not involved.

The year before, artists had tried to oppose the warehouse\u2019s destruction, but an attempt to win an injunction to prevent the owner from knocking it down was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>In the 1990s, Wolkoff had agreed to allow the derelict factory to be used as a showcase for local graffiti talent. Called the Phun Factory, it was later renamed 5Pointz by Meres One in 2002. Under the artist\u2019s watchful eye, it evolved into an \u201caerosol art centre\u201d and became famous the world over, a huge draw for graffiti aficionados and tourists alike.</p>\n<p>In the end, Wolkoff profited from the graffiti and its destruction, when the value of the complex went up from $40m to $200m and permission to build luxury condos was obtained. Destroying 5Pointz, the judge stressed, permitted Wolkoff to realise that value.</p>\n<p><strong>Proper works of art</strong></p>\n<p>Judge Block accepted that 45 artworks at the centre of the case had \u201c<a href=\"https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWj9q3wqjZAhUEr6QKHdHYBI8QFggnMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fir.lawnet.fordham.edu%2Fcgi%2Fviewcontent.cgi%3Farticle%3D3644%26context%3Dflr&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Blby3wFH756dKprSYtBCH&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=3644&amp;context=flr\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"recognised stature\" >recognised stature</a>\u201d and must receive protection under the <a href=\"http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/martin/art_law/esworthy.htm\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"Visual Artists Rights Act\" >Visual Artists Rights Act</a> (VARA), a piece of legislation which was introduced in the US in 1990 to protect artists\u2019 moral rights \u2013 but has rarely been applied in their favour.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4pCrY6T71oM\" width=\"896\" height=\"504\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The rationale used by the court to confirm these artworks were of merit was crucial. To be considered such, works of art don\u2019t need to be mentioned in academic publications or be considered masterpieces, as the expert for the property owner had argued.</p>\n<p>It was enough, the judge said, for the 5Pointz artists to show their professional achievements in terms of residences, teaching positions, fellowships, public and private commissions as well as <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/real_cities/9119430.stm\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"media coverage\" >media coverage</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/5pointznyc?lang=en\"  target=\"_blank\"  title=\"social media presence\" >social media presence</a>.</p>\n<p>Judge Block also carefully examined Wolkoff\u2019s behaviour. The artworks \u2013 even those that could be easily removed as they had been placed on plywood panels \u2013 were whitewashed prior to demolition without giving artists the 90-day notice required by VARA. And the owner did so, the judge stressed, while conscious of the fact the artists were pursuing a VARA-based legal action. Such behaviour, the judge concluded, was not acceptable.</p>\n<p>Such blatant disregard for an important legal provision pushed the judge to award the artists the maximum amount of damages allowable under the law. And although he did not grant the injunction requested by the artists in 2013, the judge had warned Wolkoff that he would be exposed to potentially high damages if the artworks were finally considered of \u201crecognised stature\u201d, as they were by the February 12 ruling.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_225051\" style=\"max-width: 523px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img data-attachment-id=\"225051\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/225049/graffiti-jerry-wolkolff-5pointz-new-york/file-20180216-50555-1nj0xnf/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17124922/file-20180216-50555-1nj0xnf.jpg?fit=754%2C424\" data-orig-size=\"754,424\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"file-20180216-50555-1nj0xnf\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17124922/file-20180216-50555-1nj0xnf.jpg?fit=300%2C169\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17124922/file-20180216-50555-1nj0xnf.jpg?fit=754%2C424\" class=\" wp-image-225051\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17124922/file-20180216-50555-1nj0xnf.jpg?resize=513%2C288&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"513\" height=\"288\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">5Pointz drew street art aficionados from all over the world with its wildly imaginative and inventive graffiti.

But the court reminded him that VARA protects both permanent and temporary art. This is an important provision of the law, especially when all that makes a work transient is the site owner\u2019s expressed intention to remove it.</p>\n<p><strong>Art vs property</strong></p>\n<p>This ruling may well embolden other graffiti artists to sue property owners who destroy artworks without following the correct procedure, even beyond the US. It may also make owners of buildings whose walls host graffiti more careful. Most important, the huge amount of damages awarded in this case will convince many that ignoring legal provisions and disregarding legitimate graffiti art is not a good idea. Judge Block made clear he awarded the maximum penalty allowable to deter other building owners from behaving in the same disrespectful way as Wolkoff.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_225052\" style=\"max-width: 459px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img data-attachment-id=\"225052\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/225049/graffiti-jerry-wolkolff-5pointz-new-york/file-20180216-50550-18szx2t/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17125101/file-20180216-50550-18szx2t.jpg?fit=754%2C503\" data-orig-size=\"754,503\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"file-20180216-50550-18szx2t\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17125101/file-20180216-50550-18szx2t.jpg?fit=300%2C200\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17125101/file-20180216-50550-18szx2t.jpg?fit=754%2C503\" class=\" wp-image-225052\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17125101/file-20180216-50550-18szx2t.jpg?resize=449%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"449\" height=\"300\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">5Pointz in Queens was an old factory that was turned into an aerosol art centre.

Nothing quite like it is found elsewhere in South Asia except perhaps in memories of the <em>bhadralok</em> Hindu zamindars of East Bengal. Possibly what imparts this special quality is not simple nostalgia for a life that is now in the past but rather that the act of writing is itself a requiem for a way of life that vanished because it was eradicated. Punjab, with the near cent percent ethnic cleansing in 1947, over a large part certainly evokes such memories.</p>\n<p>Two classics in this genre are Prakash Tandon\u2019s reminisces in his <em>Punjab Centenary</em> about Gujrat and even more so the Pakistani historian K.K. Aziz\u2019s memories of pre-partition Batala (2006). In both, Lahore inevitably has a larger than life presence and here its Government College reigns supreme, an epitome of colonial modernity and a filtering ground for a future meritocracy.</p>\n<p>Its significance lies in the memories and respect it evokes not just in those who passed through its portals in the late nineteenth century and the first three or four decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century \u2013 for they in the main part are long departed \u2013 but in their children, grandchildren and great grandchildren.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_225030\" style=\"max-width: 258px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img data-attachment-id=\"225030\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/225029/pre-partition-punjab-ruchi-ram-sahni/a-memoir-of-pre-partiton-punjab-ruchi-ram-sahni/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17035533/A-Memoir-of-Pre-Partiton-Punjab-Ruchi-Ram-Sahni.jpg?fit=327%2C499\" data-orig-size=\"327,499\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"A-Memoir-of-Pre-Partiton-Punjab-Ruchi-Ram-Sahni\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17035533/A-Memoir-of-Pre-Partiton-Punjab-Ruchi-Ram-Sahni.jpg?fit=197%2C300\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17035533/A-Memoir-of-Pre-Partiton-Punjab-Ruchi-Ram-Sahni.jpg?fit=327%2C499\" class=\" wp-image-225030\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17035533/A-Memoir-of-Pre-Partiton-Punjab-Ruchi-Ram-Sahni.jpg?resize=248%2C379&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"248\" height=\"379\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>A Memoir of Pre-Partition Punjab</em><br />Ruchi Ram Sahni<br />Edited by Neera Burra<br />Oxford Publishing House, 2017</p></div>\n<p>Neera Burra, in editing her great-grandfather\u2019s memoirs has resurrected precisely this sense. The remarkable historical document that begins with describing a Punjab on the verge of modernisation and ends as Jallianwala Bagh shattered the mutual romance of the British with the Punjabi. All this is through the pen of Ruchi Ram Sahni (1863-1948) the milestones of whose own life are no less interesting than the times he lived in.</p>\n<p>Ruchi Ram Sahni was born in Dera Ismail Khan (now in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province) where his father had moved to as a merchant and moneylender from Bhera (In Punjab in present day Sargodha district). His schooling was in Jhang and Lala Ruchi Ram\u2019s fierce determination to succeed comes through in some marvellous descriptions of walking from Bhera to Jhang and on occasion covering 50 miles in a day as a boy of 16. The railways had yet to make their appearance. He pushed his way into a high school in Lahore from where the move to Government College followed a tough entrance examination. When he graduated, he was the second batch of students to pass the Punjab university BA examination.</p>\n<p>This brief summary is only the bare bones of some wonderful pages in this autobiography describing what in essence was the first generation of Punjabis to have gone to a University. There are evocative descriptions of good and bad teachers and how a young man saw the developing cosmopolitan culture of British Lahore.</p>\n<p>Although a bright student Ruchi Ram was no ordinary crammer. His inquisitive mind comes through as he walked through Harappa sometime in 1879 or 1880 and he writes: &#8220;I remember walking over the now historical mound- but little did I dream that right under my feet lay buried the oldest known civilisation of the world.&#8221;</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>Also read:</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Neera Burra on whether a rationalist like Ruchi Ram Sahni <a href=\"https://thewire.in/218372/rationalist-like-ruchi-ram-sahni-survived-today/?utm_source=alsoread\"  title=\"would have survived today\" >would have survived today</a></h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4>Neera Burra on how her mother\u2019s <a href=\"https://thewire.in/169607/mothers-trauma-partition-shaped-i-view-pakistan/?utm_source=alsoread\"  title=\"trauma of Partition\" >trauma of Partition</a> shaped how she views Pakistan</h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>Sometime later in the 1890s he made a special effort to visit Jamrud Fort to see the room where Ranjit Singh\u2019s general Hari Singh Nalwa had died. Such asides pepper the book making for a terrific read.</p>\n<p>After his graduation Ruchi Ram joined the Indian Meteorological Examination and after a brief stint there was transferred to a teaching position in Government College Lahore. For the next three decades that was where he stayed. He left the College on being superseded in the appointment as professor-in-charge of the chemistry department with the post going to an Englishman. He spent the next two years in Europe on research in radioactivity and on returning to India in 1916 was active in public life. The Khilafat Movement, Jallianwala Bagh, membership of the Punjab Legislative Council and the debate on Non-Cooperation vs opposition from within the legislature crowd this narrative. Incidentally, he was to return the title of Rai Sahib awarded to him earlier after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_225031\" style=\"max-width: 339px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img data-attachment-id=\"225031\" data-permalink=\"https://thewire.in/225029/pre-partition-punjab-ruchi-ram-sahni/ruchi-ram-sahni/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17035803/Ruchi-Ram-Sahni.png?fit=510%2C555\" data-orig-size=\"510,555\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Ruchi-Ram-Sahni\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17035803/Ruchi-Ram-Sahni.png?fit=276%2C300\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17035803/Ruchi-Ram-Sahni.png?fit=510%2C555\" class=\" wp-image-225031\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/17035803/Ruchi-Ram-Sahni.png?resize=329%2C358&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"329\" height=\"358\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ruchi Ram Sahni. Credit: Wikipedia</p></div>\n<p>What gives this memoir a distinctive character is however also the rich cast of characters Ruchi Ram was in touch with and writes about. Many long forgotten but important figures of Punjab and elsewhere in India appear: Lala Harkishen Lal Gauba an institution of early twentieth century Lahore and father of that great but also forgotten sensationalist K.L. Gauba, Rai Bahadur Hira Lal of the Central Provinces, Mohammad Hussain Azad the author of <em>Durbar i Akbari</em>, Bhai Ram Singh possibly North India\u2019s greatest \u2018indigenous\u2019 architect, etc. There are also vignettes on A.O. Hume the founder of the Congress, M.G. Ranade, C.R. Das and others. Someone who is missing is Ganga Ram another renaissance type figure of early 20<sup>th</sup> century Lahore. The omission could perhaps be because Ruchi Ram may well have written about him in detail elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Ruchi Lal\u2019s life stands out also for its association with the major social and intellectual currents of the age. He was an early member of the Brahmo Samaj in Lahore \u2013 not a small step for him to have taken as he explains. Even more unusually was the step for a college and university teacher to establish a science workshop to repair and then make scientific instruments at a much lower cost than the imported variety. This led also to the setting up of the Punjab Science Institute which must rank as a pioneer in the efforts to popularise science. This book can also be mined usefully for the detail it contains on social life in pre-partition Punjab as Ruchi Ram has many insights into inter and intra community relations \u2013 Sikh, Hindu and Muslim. To commemorate the life of this man of so many parts a stamp was issued in India in 2013 on his 150<sup>th</sup> birth anniversary.</p>\n<p>Through all this Ruchi Ram remained also a prolific writer and diarist much of it for private reading and as a personal passion. Many of these notes were lost in the disruption of 1947 but Neera Burra has unearthed others from different libraries and archives. The edition of this memoir is perhaps the first step to adding more to the corpus of available knowledge about her ancestor. Her fine introduction to this memoir as also the detailed annotations of its text both contextualise Lala Ruchi Ram as also summarise the story which led her to match family lore with historical research and present this rich texture of a life and its times that already appear more distant than the century that separates us.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://thewire.in/author/t-c-a-raghavan/\"  title=\"T.C.A.
