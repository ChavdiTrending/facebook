Now, Make Your Boss Believe It]]></title><description type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>When I worked at an advertising agency as a junior account executive (or \"suit\") responsible for managing accounts, we had a client who didn't like any of the ad copy our creative team had presented for a certain ad. And the publication deadline was literally hours away. As a \"suit\" versus a \"creative,\" I still took it upon myself to write some ad copy, which my boss reluctantly shared with the anxious client, who loved it.</p><p><img data-credit=\"Klaus Vedfelt via Getty Images\" data-mep=\"2460901\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=6019%2C4012%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=630%2C420&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F6ea1f066f1f4c58982528dacb1ad1267%2F206134575%2Fbusinessmen-jumping-and-cheering-in-silhuet-picture-id683773784&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=9309e00ef3b30874ae5e27c4c8d57712e2938fbd\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>My copy won the day for the agency, but made my boss look bad. It appeared that he had lost control of the situation by letting me solve the problem instead of having the creative team create the ad. My relationship with my boss never recovered.</p><p>Most organizations preach a \"credit where credit is due\" policy among employees. Management often rewards individuals for coming up with cost-saving improvements and other ideas about how to make the organization a better place to work and more profitable. The environment can become competitive with everyone vying for promotions, pay increases and the favour of senior management. Egos will almost always be in play, as with the ad agency where the question of <em>who</em> actually solved the client's creative challenge became more important than the fact that the agency finally fixed the problem &mdash; and kept the business.</p><blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote\">If its immediate and positive impact is obvious, your boss may be more inclined to use it. </span></blockquote><p>When presenting an idea to your boss, it's wise to consider six things:</p><p><strong>Best for you or the business</strong></p><p>Is your idea based on solving an existing problem or building on an opportunity that will help your business? If its immediate and positive impact is obvious, your boss may be more inclined to use it. However, if it appears to promote your best interests first, then rethink sharing it.</p><p><strong>Assess the risk level</strong></p><p>Is your boss on solid ground or is she being watched closely due to lacklustre performance? If it's the former, she may be willing to try out your idea as she can afford to take a risk. If it's the latter, ensure that your idea is essentially bulletproof (largely risk free) and will make her look good.</p><p><strong>Timing is everything</strong></p><p>Timing the sharing of your idea is just as important as its benefits. Trying to get your boss' full attention in pressure-filled moments will be difficult. Even worse, you may irritate him with your lack of sensitivity to his stress. Rather, arrange to meet for coffee in a relaxed setting and give him several scheduling options. Based on his schedule and mood, he may unexpectedly say, \"I am free now. Let's talk.\" Agree to meet then and there only if you are fully prepared.</p><p>In my enthusiasm, I have presented a \"half-baked\" idea only to be asked to come back with the answers I should have prepared. (I felt the wind leave my sails when I had to go back a second time.) Not thinking through key details reduces the chances of him liking your idea and can hurt your credibility, which can be hard to restore.</p><blockquote><h2><strong>More career advice from Evan Thompson:</strong></h2><br /><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/evan-thompson/be-honest-with-yourself-before-attempting-to-change-careers_a_23336190/?utm_campaign=canada_dau\" target=\"_hplink\">Be Honest With Yourself Before Attempting To Change Careers</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/evan-thompson/heres-how-to-smooth-things-over-with-a-boss-who-cant-stand-you_a_23323035/?utm_campaign=canada_dau\" target=\"_hplink\">Here's How To Smooth Things Over With A Boss Who Can't Stand You</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/evan-thompson/an-introvert-s-guide-to-surviving-office-holiday-parties_a_23300309/?utm_campaign=canada_dau\" target=\"_hplink\">An Introvert's Guide To Surviving Office Holiday Parties</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><strong>Confidence is key</strong></p><p>My success in pitching an idea to a boss or client has always come from covering the details and my confidence in my idea. My body language reflects this confidence. Rather than taking a \"take it or leave it\" stance, I weigh her business role, personal likes and dislikes as well as current state of the organization or business.</p><p><strong>Consider your organizational position</strong></p><p>Instead of suggesting that my idea is a natural and can't-miss strategy for our organization, I say something like, \"I've spent some time considering this idea and I'd appreciate your thoughts on how you see it benefiting our organization.\" If you are presenting to a boss who is preoccupied, consider saying, \"I appreciate your time and will be concise. Let me begin with the what, when, why and how behind my idea.\"</p><p><strong>Justify and walk away</strong></p><p>After covering the details, close by offering a succinct summary of the idea and its benefits. Here's an example:</p><blockquote><p>\"Our business is growing so fast that we have more clients than account people to manage their needs. Clients have complained about dealing with a different account person every time they contact us. I suggest that we designate one team member only to manage specific client files and act as their contact person for the long term. That way, our team members can focus on certain clients who will save time while building a deeper relationship with each team member. This will lead to increased sales as our team members get to know clients' needs more fully.\"</p></blockquote><p>Then, go silent and let your boss think. Avoid the temptation to say, \"Well?\" or \"What do you think?\" Silence is a powerful negotiating tool.

They now have to prove that they can service mortgage at a qualifying rate of the greater of the contractual mortgage rate plus two percentage point or the five-year benchmark rate published by the Bank of Canada.</p><p>The monthly decline \"is largely payback\" for buyers rushing to sign deals in the last three months of the year, ahead of the new rules, said Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, in a note.</p><p><strong>January sales on par with 10-year monthly average</strong></p><p>The January market also dampened due to the Bank of Canada's decision to raise interest rates to 1.25 per cent, up from one per cent. It was the bank's third increase since last summer, following hikes in July and September.</p><p>The central bank's interest rate increase impacts variable rate mortgage holders, but those who opt for fixed mortgages also saw a rise in the five-year fixed rate amid rising bond yields and a stronger economy.</p><p>CREA noted that January home sales are on par with the 10-year monthly average and that a large decline in new listings prevented the market balance from shifting in favour of homebuyers. The average price of a home rose by 2.3 per cent when compared with last year at just over $481,500.</p><blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote\">Interestingly, new listings plunged.</span></blockquote><p>The national sales-to-new listings ratio was 63.6 per cent in January. A ratio reading above 60 per cent generally indicates a sellers' market.</p><p>The number of newly-listed homes was at the lowest level since spring 2009. About 85 per cent of all markets had fewer listings. The Greater Toronto Area led the decline, with large percentage drops also in British Columbia's Lower Mainland, Vancouver Island and the Okanagan region, as well as parts of Ontario.</p><p>\"Interestingly, new listings plunged,\" Kavcic said, highlighting a 21.6 per cent drop in listings from December 2017 to January 2018 that he said allowed the market balance to tighten up at the national level.</p><p>The highly anticipated report confirmed expectations for how the market would react to the new mortgage rules, Michael Dolega, a senior economist with TD Economics, wrote in a note.</p><blockquote><h2><strong>More from HuffPost Canada:</strong></h2><br /><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/02/14/house-prices-falling-in-majority-of-canadian-cities-as-new-rules-kick-in_a_23361508?utm_campaign=canada_dau\" target=\"_hplink\">House Prices Falling In Majority Of Canadian Cities As New Rules Kick In</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/ypnexthome/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-canadian-real-estate-in-2018_a_23337271/?utm_campaign=canada_dau\" target=\"_hplink\">5 Things you Need To Know About Canadian Real Estate In 2018</a></li></ul></blockquote><p>He expects some near-term volatility to continue as buyers and sellers absorb the fall out from the new rules and rising rates. But, Dolega said \"some stabilization\" should occur by the middle of the year.</p><p>\"Thereafter we expect activity to remain weighed down by rising interest rates, but with markets largely in balanced territory prices should remain well supported,\" he said.</p><p>The new mortgage rules created uncertainty and confusion for homebuyers, said CREA President Andrew Peck in a statement.</p><p>\"At the same time, the changes do nothing to address government concerns about home prices that stem from an ongoing supply shortage in major markets like Vancouver and Toronto.

San Francisco, Calif.\" data-credit=\"Justin Sullivan via Getty Images\"><p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash; Apple's new internet-connected speaker is proving to be more appealing to the ears than to the eyes, depending on where the device is placed.</p><p>Some people who bought the just-released $349 speaker, dubbed the HomePod, are reporting that it leaves a white ring on the surfaces of wooden furniture.</p><p>In an explanation posted Wednesday, Apple said the problem occurs with speakers that, like the HomePod, are equipped with a silicon base to minimize vibration. The company said the marks will often \"go away'' after a few days if you move the speaker somewhere else.</p><p>If they don't, it recommends wiping wood tarnished by the HomePod with a soft or damp cloth, or cleaning the surface \"with the furniture manufacturer's recommended cleaning process.''</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">So some HomePods are staining wood tables, leaving a white ring behind.<br /><br />\nApple's official response: \"We recommend placing your HomePod on a different surface\"<br /><br />\nIf that isn't CLAASIC Apple, I don't know what is \ud83e\udd13<br /><a href=\"https://t.co/bwEda4qK1r\">https://t.co/bwEda4qK1r</a><a href=\"https://t.co/Eb0gKYEwVi\">pic.twitter.com/Eb0gKYEwVi</a></p>\n&mdash; Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/963937823198928896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 15, 2018</a></blockquote><p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Apple HomePod leaves nasty 'white ring of death' stain on owners' tables <a href=\"https://t.co/3LU0bkXMd7\">https://t.co/3LU0bkXMd7</a><a href=\"https://t.co/GyMjfjFJyS\">pic.twitter.com/GyMjfjFJyS</a></p>\n&mdash; Louise Stainton (@LouiseStaintonU) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LouiseStaintonU/status/964085675870978048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 15, 2018</a></blockquote><p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p><p>The marks left by the HomePod threaten to stain Apple's reputation for designing iPhones, iPads and Mac computers that are frequently prized as much for how they look as for how they work. Though it's still too early to tell whether the HomePod's blemishes on wood will dampen the device's sales. If so, that could hamper Apple's efforts to catch up to less expensive internet-connected speakers from Amazon and Google that had a head start in the still nascent market.</p><p>Both Amazon and Google designed their speakers primarily to serve as digital hubs that manage peoples' homes and lives via voice-activated assistants. Apple, by contrast, is marketing the HomePod as a high-fidelity speaker programmed to learn listeners' tastes and automatically select songs from the company's music-streaming library.</p><p>In the process, Apple hopes to build upon its 36 million Apple Music subscribers and to establish a toehold in people's homes that will give it more opportunities to peddle its services. The HomePod also features Apple's assistant Siri, which is still catching up to Amazon's Alexa and Google's eponymous Assistant in responsiveness and versatility.</p><p><em><strong>Related on HuffPost:</strong></em><!-- TAG START { player: \"* CA Play In Place Autoplay \", owner: \"AOL Canada\", for: \"AOL Canada\" } --></p><div class=\"vdb_player vdb_58e28f10c214e34d93b12069564e003d67b62214082cc703\" data-placeholder=\"//img.vidible.tv/prod/2018-02/14/5a847e0d0c062d40be9437ff/5a847e0c1c4149386332036a_o_F_v0.jpg?w=1584&amp;h=990\" id=\"58e28f10c214e34d93b12069\" vdb_params=\"m.embeded=cms_video_plugin_cms.publishing.oath.com\"><img src=\"https://img.vidible.tv/prod/2018-02/14/5a847e0d0c062d40be9437ff/5a847e0c1c4149386332036a_o_F_v0.jpg\" style=\"display:none;\" /><script src=\"//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=58e28f10c214e34d93b12069/vid=5a847e0d0c062d40be9437ff,5a7de61a85eb42244cf9ec2a,5a8005af85eb42244cfabf1f,5a835d2a9efa8978b76bbbec,5a7b962c46bd1e319295ad85,5a81f0c28c08e038362845e4/564e003d67b62214082cc703.js?m.embeded=cms_video_plugin_cms.publishing.oath.com\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></div><p><!-- TAG END { date: 02/15/18 } --></p>]]></description><link>http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/02/15/apple-homepod-leaves-white-ring-on-wooden-surfaces-customers-say_a_23362619/</link><source_id>0SfWab</source_id><guid isPermalink=\"false\">23362619</guid><dc:creator>Michael Liedtke, The Associated Press / via CP</dc:creator><dc:publisher>AMP: HuffPost Canada</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Other</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 16:25:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1518712112838465000</ingested><modified>2018-02-15T16:30:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[apple]]></category><category><![CDATA[apple homepod]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[homepod ring]]></category><category><![CDATA[apple-homepod]]></category><category><![CDATA[business]]></category><category><![CDATA[homepod-ring]]></category><category><![CDATA[BUSINESS]]></category><media:content url=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/cc139c3786834d4ac4cbf144ae413d/206130405/customers-inspect-the-new-apple-homepod-at-an-apple-store-on-february-picture-id916301846\" width=\"\" height=\"\" medium=\"image\"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Justin Sullivan via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Customers inspect the new Apple HomePod at an Apple Store on Feb. 9, 2018 in San Francisco, Calif.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url=\"http://delivery.vidible.tv/video/redirect/5a847e0d0c062d40be9437ff.mp4?bcid=58fc8dae222f89716decad17&amp;w=1280&amp;h=720&amp;enc=mp4&amp;domain=cdn.vidible.tv\" medium=\"video\"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[5a847e0d0c062d40be9437ff,5a7de61a85eb42244cf9ec2a,5a8005af85eb42244cfabf1f,5a835d2a9efa8978b76bbbec,5a7b962c46bd1e319295ad85,5a81f0c28c08e038362845e4]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title><media:embed><![CDATA[<div class=\"vdb_player vdb_58e28f10c214e34d93b12069564e003d67b62214082cc703\" data-placeholder=\"//img.vidible.tv/prod/2018-02/14/5a847e0d0c062d40be9437ff/5a847e0c1c4149386332036a_o_F_v0.jpg?w=1584&amp;h=990\" id=\"58e28f10c214e34d93b12069\" vdb_params=\"m.embeded=cms_video_plugin_cms.publishing.oath.com\"><img src=\"https://img.vidible.tv/prod/2018-02/14/5a847e0d0c062d40be9437ff/5a847e0c1c4149386332036a_o_F_v0.jpg\" style=\"display:none;\"/><script src=\"//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=58e28f10c214e34d93b12069/vid=5a847e0d0c062d40be9437ff,5a7de61a85eb42244cf9ec2a,5a8005af85eb42244cfabf1f,5a835d2a9efa8978b76bbbec,5a7b962c46bd1e319295ad85,5a81f0c28c08e038362845e4/564e003d67b62214082cc703.js?m.embeded=cms_video_plugin_cms.publishing.oath.com\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></div>]]></media:embed></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Supercluster' Funding: Navdeep Bains Unveils 5 Tech Groups Will Split $950M]]></title><description type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<img src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/2844x1424+0+252/resize/630x315!/format/jpg/quality/85/http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F7d4bb95a40c067ef3dc7270cfbb6dd4d%2F206130357%2F18546652.jpg\" alt=\"Innovation, Science and Economic Development Minister Navdeep Bains takes part in a technology event in Ottawa on May 8, 2017. \" data-caption=\"Innovation, Science and Economic Development Minister Navdeep Bains takes part in a technology event in Ottawa on May 8, 2017. \" data-credit=\"Sean Kilpatrick/CP\"><p>OTTAWA &mdash;

Sit down and talk about your debt, your savings and how much you make. Share your credit score with your partner, and learn what theirs is as well, as we find out too late, like when we're declined for a mortgage application.</p><p>If you're in a serious relationship, your partner should know where you stand financially.

to pay for prescription drugs in 2016, suggests a nationwide study on the topic published Tuesday.</p><p>The review was conducted by researchers at the University of British Columbia, Simon Fraser University, McMaster University, and the University of Toronto.</p><p>The study, published in the online version of the Canadian Medical Association Journal, indicated that 968,000 Canadians reduced their spending on basic necessities to pay for medication &mdash; with 730,000 cutting their food bills and another 238,000 skimping on heating.</p><p>According to the findings, an estimated 1.7 million Canadians &mdash; 8.2 per cent of those ordered to take medications in 2016 &mdash; didn't fill their prescription because of cost.</p><blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote\">We tend to think that people in Quebec have better coverage for medicines than elsewhere in Canada.</span><span class=\"attribution\" style=\"display:block;\">Michael Law, UBC</span></blockquote><p>Michael Law, a UBC professor and Canada Research Chair in Access to Medicines, said that while it was already known that people had difficulty paying for prescription drugs, the analysis shows the extent to which people are eliminating necessities to purchase them.</p><p>Quebec had the lowest percentage of people (3.7 per cent) not filling a prescription due to the costs. The worst offender was British Columbia at 8.11 per cent, in particular due to the high cost of living and high deductibles for medications.</p><p>\"We tend to think that people in Quebec have better coverage for medicines than elsewhere in Canada,\" said Law, the lead author of the study.</p><p><strong>Drug-coverage improvements would lead to health-care savings</strong></p><p>Another consequence of not taking medications is that many people in 2016 ended up in the emergency room (93,000) or consulted a doctor (300,000) &mdash; measures that increased health-care costs.</p><p>\"It suggests that if you improve drug coverage, the cost to government is of course gonna be the cost of the drug, but you are gonna see some savings on the other end as people don't end up in hospitals and in the doctor's office,\" Law said.</p><p>Of those surveyed, young adults, low-income earners and those without drug coverage were more likely to have problems buying drugs as well as requiring additional care.</p><blockquote><h2><strong>More from HuffPost Canada:</strong></h2><br /><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/adam-kassam/lets-talk-about-the-patients-the-pharmacare-debate-has-forgotten_a_23303058/?utm_campaign=canada_dau\" target=\"_hplink\">Blog: Let's Talk About The Patients The Pharmacare Debate Has Forgotten</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/09/28/canadian-universal-pharmacare-program-would-save-more-than-4-billion-a-year-pbo_a_23226555/?utm_campaign=canada_dau\" target=\"_hplink\">Canadian Universal Pharmacare Program Would Save More Than $4 Billion A Year: PBO</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/steve-morgan/canada-pharmacare-4-reasons_b_16489086.html?utm_campaign=canada_dau\" target=\"_hplink\">Blog: 4 Reasons Canada Needs Universal Pharmacare Now</a></li></ul></blockquote><p>Women in general also faced difficulties. They take more medication than men, such as contraceptives, which aren't covered by insurance plans, Law said. They also earn less money on average.</p><p>Of the medications that commonly weren't purchased for financial reasons, most were for depression, anxiety or other mental-health issues.</p><p>More than 28,000 people participated in the study, with data collected with assistance from Statistics Canada, as part of its Canadian Community Health Survey.</p><p><strong><em>Also On HuffPost:</em></strong></p><div class=\"vdb_player vdb_58e28f10c214e34d93b12069564e003d67b62214082cc703\" data-placeholder=\"//img.vidible.tv/prod/2017-10/29/59f65896dbbc25327799ce9d/59f65cb94da4302c825c13f1_o_U_v1.jpg?w=1440&amp;h=900\" id=\"58e28f10c214e34d93b12069\" vdb_params=\"m.embeded=cms_video_plugin_cms.publishing.oath.com\"><img src=\"https://img.vidible.tv/prod/2017-10/29/59f65896dbbc25327799ce9d/59f65cb94da4302c825c13f1_o_U_v1.jpg\" style=\"display:none;\" /><script src=\"//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=58e28f10c214e34d93b12069/vid=59f65896dbbc25327799ce9d,59f62df4955a3142de1e10c1,5a09bb1a8c08e07dcac4b05f,59f762bd88420b4f579b8195/564e003d67b62214082cc703.js?m.embeded=cms_video_plugin_cms.publishing.oath.com\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></div><!-- Byline, Source -->]]></description><link>http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/02/14/canadians-prescription-drugs_a_23361387/</link><source_id>0SfWab</source_id><guid isPermalink=\"false\">23361387</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Chin</dc:creator><dc:publisher>AMP: HuffPost Canada</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Other</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2018 13:11:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1518616939343677000</ingested><modified>2018-02-14T14:01:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Canada health care]]></category><category><![CDATA[Canada pharmacare]]></category><category><![CDATA[Canada prescription drugs]]></category><category><![CDATA[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]></category><category><![CDATA[business]]></category><category><![CDATA[canada-health-care]]></category><category><![CDATA[canada-pharmacare]]></category><category><![CDATA[canada-prescription-drugs]]></category><category><![CDATA[canadian-medical-association-journal]]></category><category><![CDATA[BUSINESS]]></category><media:content url=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/b4ae014212505ec89a3250f368ca202e/206126434/man-taking-pills-picture-id666792964\" width=\"\" height=\"\" medium=\"image\"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[outline205 via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[According to the findings, an estimated 1.7 million Canadians didn't fill their prescription because of cost.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url=\"http://delivery.vidible.tv/video/redirect/5a09bb1a8c08e07dcac4b05f.mp4?bcid=58fc8dae222f89716decad17&amp;w=1080&amp;h=1080&amp;enc=mp4&amp;domain=cdn.vidible.tv\" medium=\"video\"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[59f65896dbbc25327799ce9d,59f62df4955a3142de1e10c1,5a09bb1a8c08e07dcac4b05f,59f762bd88420b4f579b8195]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title><media:embed><![CDATA[<div class=\"vdb_player vdb_58e28f10c214e34d93b12069564e003d67b62214082cc703\" data-placeholder=\"//img.vidible.tv/prod/2017-10/29/59f65896dbbc25327799ce9d/59f65cb94da4302c825c13f1_o_U_v1.jpg?w=1440&amp;h=900\" id=\"58e28f10c214e34d93b12069\" vdb_params=\"m.embeded=cms_video_plugin_cms.publishing.oath.com\"><img src=\"https://img.vidible.tv/prod/2017-10/29/59f65896dbbc25327799ce9d/59f65cb94da4302c825c13f1_o_U_v1.jpg\" style=\"display:none;\"/><script src=\"//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=58e28f10c214e34d93b12069/vid=59f65896dbbc25327799ce9d,59f62df4955a3142de1e10c1,5a09bb1a8c08e07dcac4b05f,59f762bd88420b4f579b8195/564e003d67b62214082cc703.js?m.embeded=cms_video_plugin_cms.publishing.oath.com\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></div>]]></media:embed></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[U.S. Ambassador Kelly Craft Says Donald Trump Isn\u2019t Great At Making Plans]]></title><description type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<img src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/809x405+3+14/resize/630x315!/format/jpg/quality/85/http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fa18e237e0b1b1eac339852cf9bbb2ef7%2F206125420%2FUntitled%2Bdesign.png\" alt=\"U.S. Ambassador to Canada Kelly Craft was asked to share with the Macdonald-Laurier Institute what U.S. President Donald Trump is like in-person during a gala on Fe. 13, 2018. \" data-caption=\"U.S. Ambassador to Canada Kelly Craft was asked to share with the Macdonald-Laurier Institute what U.S. President Donald Trump is like in-person during a gala on Fe. 13, 2018. \" data-credit=\"The Washington Post via Getty Images/Getty Images\"><p><span>OTTAWA &mdash;

and provide financial incentives for investments in artificial intelligence and robotics following U.S. tax reforms, says a leading tax expert.</p><p>\"I think there's room for tax reform,\" said Jack Mintz, a professor at the University of Calgary.</p><p>He said the combined Canadian corporate rate should drop two percentage points to 25 per cent to protect the government's tax base while the government also gives a signal encouraging more investment.</p><p>The U.S. cut its corporate tax rate to 21 per cent from 35 per cent, allowed firms to immediately write off investments in equipment and removed taxation on dividends.</p><p><strong>Staying competitive</strong></p><p>\"We're going to have to think a lot more about how we can keep up, otherwise our businesses won't be competitive relative to the U.S.,\" he said in an interview.</p><p>TD deputy chief economist Derek Burleton said the tax reform bill has considerably eroded Canada's favourable corporate taxation position, giving the U.S. an edge.</p><p>However, he added that the temporary nature of key elements of the tax reforms and uncertainty over future rates could offset the push to deploy investments in the U.S.</p><p>He expects the result will be a longer-term \"bleed\" in capital from Canada rather than a sudden exodus of investment.</p><blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote\">We're going to have to think a lot more about how we can keep up, otherwise our businesses won't be competitive relative to the U.S.</span><span class=\"attribution\" style=\"display:block;\">Jack Mintz</span></blockquote><p>\"A greater difficulty in attracting and retaining investment in Canada would weigh on the country's longer-term growth prospects,\" he wrote in a report.</p><p>The changes are also increasing pressure on Canadian governments to take action. The federal government will unveil its budget Feb. 27.</p><p>Burleton said a \"tit-for-tat\" tax cut isn't necessary since taxes are only one factor in competitiveness. Instead, he said Canada should focus on tax reform over cuts. That includes eliminating inefficient tax credits and outdated regulations.</p><p>A CIBC World Markets report said the U.S. tax changes will make Canada less competitive and end the use of tax inversions.</p><p><strong>No more inversions</strong></p><p>\"Don't expect any more inversions,\" wrote Ian de Verteuil, CIBC's managing director.</p><p>Inversions have been used by companies like Restaurant Brands International Inc. to buy Tim Hortons and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. to acquire Biovail Corporation.</p><p>An inversions is what results when a foreign company merges with a U.S. or domestic firm, creating a new parent company based in another country with lower tax rates.</p><p>The U.S. was the only G7 country that taxed companies regardless where they were located in the world. That encouraged many to set up in Ireland or Canada where they would get a credit for taxes paid at a lower rate than in the U.S.</p><p>U.S. changes approved before Christmas adopted a \"territorial approach\" that applies a tax of 15.5 per cent, similar to Ireland's rate.</p><blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote\">There's a lot of companies now that are evaluating about investing more in the U.S. and will some of the inverted companies decide to come home? That's possible.</span><span class=\"attribution\" style=\"display:block;\">Jack Mintz</span></blockquote><p>Mintz said the major reason for inversions is no longer relevant because dividends will be tax exempt and the overall U.S. corporate rate has been slashed.</p><p>\"There's a lot of companies now that are evaluating about investing more in the U.S. and will some of the inverted companies decide to come home? That's possible.\"</p><p>Roy Berg, an American tax specialist at Moodys Gartner Tax Law LLP, said the tax reforms remove the incentive to establish a Canadian corporate parent company.</p><p>\"It's all of a sudden very, very competitive for that parked capital,\" he said in an interview.</p><p><strong>More than just tax issues</strong></p><p>Russell Crawford, head of KPMG's corporate tax practice in Canada, said his firm is busy these days helping companies to understand and take advantage of the U.S. tax reforms.</p><p>But he doesn't believe the U.S. tax changes, which lower federal rates to just below Canada's rate, will be the determining factor for corporate decisions.</p><p>\"I think it's always going to be business issues, not tax issues that are going to drive where a company is headquartered and where they're doing business,\" said Crawford.</p><p><em><strong>Also on HuffPost:</strong></em></p><div class=\"vdb_player

Ottawa is carefully assessing the U.S. tax changes and will take time to fully understand their potential impacts, his office said in a recent statement.</p><p>Scotiabank chief economist Jean-Francois Perrault said he doesn't think the corporate tax changes in the U.S. will have a major impact on Canada &mdash; but he admits they could.</p><p>Perrault, who will attend Friday's meeting with Morneau, recommends the government hold off on any big spending plans just in case it needs to respond with tax measures of its own to keep Canada competitive.</p><p>\"It would be very prudent for the government to wait until we see if, in fact, there is evidence that what's happening down south in the U.S. is having a detrimental effect on Canadian business,\" Perrault said.</p><p><strong>Liberals looking at smaller deficits</strong></p><p>Heading into the budget, he thinks the solid economy has given Morneau more fiscal space than he had in the fall. </p><p>In October, Morneau's fall fiscal statement predicted a deficit of $18.4 billion in 2017-18 and a $15.6-billion shortfall in 2018-19.</p><p>Perrault, a former assistant deputy minister under Morneau, said he now expects Ottawa to be on track for deficits of $16.8 billion in 2017-18 and $14.8 billion in 2018-19.</p><p>Porter doesn't think there have been major changes in the government's budgetary outlook since the fall because 2017's surprising strength was largely due to temporary factors. This year, the economy, while still looking relatively healthy, should be a little bit cooler, he added.</p><p>Craig Alexander, chief economist for The Conference Board of Canada, predicts the deficit to be about $4 billion smaller in 2017-18.</p><p>\"But going forward, they're not going to have a lot of extra money in the kitty for new initiatives if they want to keep debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward path,\" he said.</p><p><strong>Plan to balance books?</strong></p><p>Following the 2015 election, the Liberal government abandoned pledges to run annual deficits of no more than $10 billion and to balance the books in four years. Instead, it is focused on reducing the net debt-to-GDP ratio &mdash; also known as the debt burden &mdash; each year.</p><p>Alexander would like to see Morneau produce a plan to balance the books, while Perrault is less concerned about it as long as Ottawa keeps lowering the debt-to-GDP.</p><p>Porter would also like to see an effort to eliminate the deficit because Canada is entering a late stage in the economic cycle &mdash; but it's not his top priority.</p><p>\"I'm concerned about our tax competitiveness first and foremost, and that's actually where I'd like to see the government concentrate efforts.\"</p><p>On Tuesday, Morneau offered a preview of what the government narrative surrounding the budget will likely sound like.</p><p>\"We've seen real improvements over the last couple of years for middle-class Canadians &mdash; more confidence and among the lowest unemployment rates in the last 40 years,\" he said during question period.</p><p>\"But there's more work to do, Mr. Speaker.

She introduced an opposition motion in the House of Commons on Monday calling on the federal government to make public no later than Feb. 15, its specific plan to get the pipeline built.</p><p>Stubbs said the Liberals keep saying the same thing over and over, that they approved the pipeline and that it will get built, but they are not putting any specifics on the table about how that will happen.

type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>As part of my job, I'm in the air a lot, heading off to meet with members across the country.</p><p>In doing so, I can't help but notice airlines pushing the federal government to <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/pilot-shortage-bearskin-air-georgian-super-t-1.4451976\" rel=\"nofollow\">delay or weaken new fatigue rules</a>, blaming an expected shortage of pilots in the years to come.</p><p>If the industry expects to be short of pilots, maybe the more pressing issue is why any young person would want to become a pilot in Canada in the first place?</p><p><img data-credit=\"Antara Photo Agency / Reuters\" data-mep=\"2442886\"

alt=\"\" /></p><p>For one thing, it's incredibly expensive to become a pilot. Before becoming a professional pilot, students must go through flight school, costing <a href=\"https://www.skiesmag.com/news/canadian-pilot-shortage-real-says-industry-consultant/\" rel=\"nofollow\">upwards of $90,000</a>.</p><p>There's also no stable career path to move from trainee to becoming a pilot with a major carrier &mdash; far from it, in fact. Graduating from flight school just puts students on the fast track to precarious employment and a paltry salary of <a href=\"https://www.copanational.org/sites/copanational.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ATAC-ProfessionalPilotCareerInformationBrochure.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">roughly $25,000 a year</a>. Another challenge is that first jobs for pilots are often in northern Canada and other remote areas, far away from friends and family.</p><p>Even if a new pilot can somehow cover the financial cost of becoming a pilot, and accepts the possibility of moving far from home to work, they also face bigger safety concerns.</p><p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/aviation/2011/a11w0048/a11w0048.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">Transportation Safety Board</a>, remote routes accounted for 88 per cent of all accidents, 87 per cent of all fatalities and 82 per cent of all serious injuries involving Canadian commercial aircraft in the past <a href=\"http://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/aviation/2011/a11w0048/a11w0048.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">decade</a>.</p><blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote\">In a desperate effort to cut costs, airlines are doing themselves and their workers a grave disservice.</span></blockquote><p>Ask any pilot in Canada how challenging &mdash; and tiring &mdash; these rural and northern operations can be. Canadian pilots working with the Safer Skies coalition, of which Unifor is a member, have <a href=\"https://saferskies.ca/pilot-stories\" rel=\"nofollow\">collected</a> the concerns of their colleagues.</p><p>Frankly, the responses are startling:</p><p>One young pilot said he was reluctant to complain about unsafe flying conditions, saying \"I was too young and too worried about being fired.\"</p><p>Another described long days running the fuel farm, including sales to other airlines, and washing mud off his airplane at the end of each day on top of his regular flying duties.</p><p>Before even boarding his plane for his 14-hour shift, one pilot said, he would receive shopping orders through his cell phone for people along his route &mdash; essentials such as diapers, boat tar, bread, peanut butter. They would pay him with cheques signed over to him. He'd give the change back, and cash all the cheques at the end of each week.</p><p><img data-credit=\"Digital Vision.\" data-mep=\"2442887\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=3818%2C2608%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=630%2C430&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fcca8136407849541196d319f2d7d83b7%2F204058381%2Fdv219005.jpg&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=3799497d57ffb4d0f5c28bf554fdcd10e175bf0f\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>In a desperate effort to cut costs, airlines are doing themselves and their workers a grave disservice by calling for a delay in addressing pilot fatigue. In fact, airlines are actually fighting against better working conditions for new pilots &mdash; which will only discourage more young people from going into aviation.</p><p>While the draft <em>Regulations Amending the Canadian Aviation Regulations</em> published in the <a href=\"http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p1/2017/2017-07-01/html/reg2-eng.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Canada Gazette</a> last July set out how long a pilot should be on duty &mdash; from the moment they report for duty to the moment they park their aircraft at their destination and are free of all responsibilities &mdash; the government's proposal falls short of what scientific authorities, including NASA's Ames Research Center, call for.</p><blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">To attract more young pilots, they should work hard to ensure a safe and stable workplace, instead of pushing a plan that puts pilots and the flying public at greater risk.</blockquote><p>This is especially true when pilots fly overnight, when the dangers of <a href=\"https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/canadas-proposed-fatigue-regulations-fall-short-of-ensuring-safer-skies-632486123.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">fatigue</a> are even greater. The new regulations would allow for pilots to be on duty for <a href=\"http://cms.saferskies.ca/Media/SaferSkies/SiteFiles/Safer-Skies-Coalition-Executive-Summary.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">10.5 hours</a> &mdash; two and a half hours longer than the Federal Aviation Administration allows American pilots to fly in the United States, and two hours longer than NASA recommends.</p><p>The government is also proposing a two-step implementation that forces the most vulnerable pilots, those at smaller companies and in rural and remote areas, to wait up to four years before the rules providing fatigue protection to come into force. Pilots at major airlines would be protected after just one year.</p><blockquote><h2><strong>More blogs from HuffPost Canada:</strong></h2><br /><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/mathieu-bedard/bravo-for-having-the-audacity-to-ask-canadian-airlines-to-compete_a_23355738?utm_campaign=canada_dau\" target=\"_hplink\">Bravo For Having The Audacity To Ask Canadian Airlines To Compete</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/andrew-damours/ultra-low-cost-carriers-are-finally-coming-to-canada_a_23037870?utm_campaign=canada_dau\" target=\"_hplink\">Things Are Actually Looking Up For Thrifty Canadian Fliers</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/rhonda-scharf/customer-service_b_9625962.html?utm_campaign=canada_dau\" target=\"_hplink\">Don't Mistake Speed For Efficiency In Customer Service</a></li></ul></blockquote><p>Forcing the most vulnerable pilots to wait the longest makes absolutely no sense.

Sometime this year, Amazon will decide which city amongst the 20 it shortlisted recently will be home to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/b?node=17044620011\" rel=\"nofollow\">HQ2, its second headquarters.</a></p><p><img data-credit=\"NurPhoto via Getty Images\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=3888%2C2592%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=630%2C420&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F8a5caee0834b6195a9b57e2c2eb22f2a%2F204167434%2F521186348.jpg&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=dd6272d4d1f1ffc5283a6711eecab1be7b154625\" data-mep=\"2443130\" alt=\"\" data-provider=\"getty\" data-provider-asset-id=\"521186348\" /></p><p>Many have come to describe their search has <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/01/amazon-hq2-20-cities/550790/\" rel=\"nofollow\">something akin to a beauty pageant</a> amongst North America's most prominent municipalities. Americans keen to place a wager might have been surprised to see a Canadian city shortlisted. Those unfamiliar with Toronto, Ont. may place it at a disadvantage simply by being across America's northern border. Others may justify its shortlisting by depicting Toronto's economy and social fabric as similar to their own big city. A large and growing population, and a modern economy full of opportunity, culture and big sports franchises.</p><p>Make no mistake, though. Toronto and Canada have been shortlisted not for their sameness, but for their differences. A simple way of understanding these differences is to reflect on three defining words in each of our constitutions. The Americans are a people devoted to \"life, liberty and pursuit of happiness\" whereas Canadians put their bets on \"peace, harmony and good governance.\" The Americans embrace individualism, whereas we are far more collective. At this stage of Amazon's development and expansion, Toronto fits the bill far better than other cities on the list.</p><p>Amazon has stated that it will pick a city with tech-oriented talent and a stable and innovative business market. Many cities interpreted this ask, at least partially, as a request for exclusive financial incentives like tax breaks &mdash; something that has come under great criticism as of late.</p><blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">The balance sheet looks different when you add these benefits up against the slightly more favourable corporate tax regime in the United States.</blockquote><p>Toronto is the exception to this trend. Amazon would not receive any free money by crossing the border. But its employees, Canadian or otherwise, would enjoy a quality of life that has been touted by many. In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/toronto-progress-portal/world-rankings-for-toronto/economist-intelligence-unit-livability-survey/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Toronto was ranked fourth in the Economist Intelligence Unit's Liveability Rankings</a>, and for good reason. Excellent public schools, affordable post-secondary education, access to publicly funded health care with no extra insurance premiums or hefty deductibles for every visit to the doctor all come standard.</p><p>But perhaps most importantly, Amazon and its employees would benefit from a society that is largely cohesive, where crime rates are low and where democracy and the rule of law function well. The balance sheet looks different when you add these benefits up against the slightly more favourable corporate tax regime in the United States.</p><p><img data-credit=\"Getty Images/iStockphoto\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=4575%2C3050%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=630%2C420&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fb4f5cb408a957f67c18711c6d825e315%2F206119806%2Ftower-and-downtown-toronto-at-dusk-picture-id617902276&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=b0fae6be23fcfd41f9b64d3870d5ac61f36fca95\" data-mep=\"2443131\" alt=\"\" data-provider=\"getty\" data-provider-asset-id=\"617902276\" /></p><p>But Toronto's bid is not defined by Canada's progressive social policies alone. Its bid was accompanied by a commitment at the provincial level to make the investments necessary to meet and exceed its labour needs and <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/amazon-google-ontario-toronto-technology-stem-1.4360106\" rel=\"nofollow\">ensure that it puts out the most STEM graduates per capita in North America</a>. Should Amazon select Toronto, Ontario would spend the next five years increasing graduates from these disciplines by 25 per cent, and would pave the way for an additional 1,000 masters students to immerse themselves in artificial intelligence.</p><p>Canada is also using artificial intelligence at the national level to entice Amazon northward. The Canadian government launched <a href=\"https://www.fin.gc.ca/n17/17-026-eng.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">its Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy just last year</a>, and has committed over $125 million to research and development through its multiple innovation envelopes.</p><blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote\">Amazon may well have recognized that Toronto's labour force is indeed future-proof.</span></blockquote><p>Amazon is not the sole beneficiary of any of these investments. These are expenditures that reach Canadians at the individual level, and aim to reach everything from tech startups and talented international innovators to academic institutions and public services. But in shortlisting Toronto, Amazon may well have recognized that Toronto's labour force is indeed future-proof. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2018/01/25/if-amazon-chooses-toronto-the-decision-would-be-bullish-for-the-u-s-economy/#52b35219799b\" rel=\"nofollow\">As James Tamney has pointed out in Forbes magazine</a>, \"Toronto is attractive to Amazon owing to Canada's more open stance toward immigration. No doubt the Canadian government aims to manage foreign arrivals too, but for the most part it's easier for non-natives to live and work in Canada than it is for them to do so in the U.S.\"</p><blockquote><h2><strong>More from HuffPost Canada:</strong></h2><br /><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/dr-steven-murphy/amazon-wants-a-2nd-headquarters-toronto-has-what-it-takes_a_23209229?utm_campaign=canada_dau\" target=\"_hplink\">Amazon Wants A 2nd Headquarters.

This year, Amazon must choose whether to stay in America or apply for dual citizenship in Canada, where the right types of investments are underway. All they have to do is say \"yes.\"</p><p><em>Ratna Omidvar is a Canadian senator representing Ontario.

Perhaps they're forgetting that RRSPs are a great way to lower income tax and increase their refund. Further, the money contributed grows tax-free for many years to come, providing some hope for a bright retirement.</p><p>There are many reasons why Canadians may not be taking advantage of RRSP contributions, including competing financial demands that make it difficult to put money aside.

For example, if you are going to have a higher income next year (and therefore be taxed at a higher rate,) you might want to carry it forward since your tax savings will be greater</p><p>Another option Canadians have with RRSPs is to contribute to one that's in the name of a spouse or common law partner; just keep in mind that it lowers your personal RRSP deduction limit. This would be beneficial where one spouse has a higher income than the other. The higher income spouse claims the deduction, but the lower-income spouse will include it in income when they make a withdrawal.</p><p>Overall, when it comes to retirement, Old Age Security payments and Canada Pension Plan benefits won't necessarily provide the income many Canadians are looking for. For those without a company pension or other savings, a more comfortable retirement can be reached with a RRSP.</p><p><img data-credit=\"gradyreese via Getty Images\" data-mep=\"2443072\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=4859%2C3345%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=630%2C434&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fea7d7050c924b3e2d589b9ac2e2c8ff7%2F206119736%2Fboosting-their-longterm-wellbeing-together-picture-id804450356&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=889cf0e4cbb2cf8be8529fc8b91ffa0ac156c993\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>For those not thinking quite that far ahead, keep in mind that there are two other ways that Canadians can access RRSP money.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/rrsps-related-plans/what-home-buyers-plan.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">RRSP Homebuyers' Plan</a> has been enormously popular as it allows individuals to withdraw up to $25,000 from RRSPs to buy or build their first home without having to pay tax on the withdrawal.

More details could be coming this week, he suggested.</p><p>''We are going to charge countries outside of our country &mdash; countries that take advantage of the United States,'' Trump said. ''Some of them are so-called allies but they are not allies on trade. ... So we're going to be doing very much a reciprocal tax and you'll be hearing about that during the week and the coming months.''</p><p>It's unclear what type of tax he's referring to. Earlier this year, the administration dropped the idea of a border-adjustment tax in its since-passed fiscal reform, because of widespread opposition on Capitol Hill.</p><p>The confusion was compounded by several factors:</p><ul><li>In the U.S., Congress sets tax rates &mdash; not the president. And the Congress, which just completed a major tax reform, has shown little inclination to hike taxes.</li><li>Tariff rates, meanwhile, are negotiated at the WTO.</li><li>The idea wasn't even mentioned in the White House's 2018 budget proposal &mdash; which was released Monday.</li></ul><p>The most specific clue Trump offered involved motorycles.</p><p>He complained that the U.S. brings in products tariff-free and other countries sometimes charge more than 50 per cent tariffs on the same product: ''Harley-Davidson. They're treated very unfairly in various countries. You know the countries I'm talking about,'' Trump said. ''So we're going to be doing very much a reciprocal tax.''</p><p>Those motorcycle tariffs are highest in Asia &mdash; they don't exist in North America.</p><p><strong><span>Experts confused by president's comments</span></strong></p><p>Several trade experts contacted Monday confessed to some confusion about what the president was threatening. Dan Ikenson of the Cato Institute said the only action he could think of might violate international trade law.</p><p>It involves a rarely used retaliatory measure from a 1974 U.S. trade law.</p><p>''Could be anything, but nothing he could do, while remaining true to the trade rules,'' Ikenson said.</p><p>''Presumably, he could invoke Section 301 (of the 1974 U.S. Trade Act) and threaten to impose taxes to mitigate, countervail, reverse foreign practices that he finds unfair.

The so-called Falcon Heavy rocket carried the whimsical payload of Musk's red Tesla roadster and a mannequin in a spacesuit, blasting David Bowie tunes while flashing on the car's dashboard Douglas Addams's famous phrase, \"Don't Panic.\" It was a triumph of nerdish power, but also an effective demonstration of SpaceX's new space commercialization capacities.</p><p><img alt=\"The SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket lifts off from launch pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center on Feb. 6, 2018 in Cape Canaveral, Fla.\" data-caption=\"The SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket lifts off from launch pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center on Feb. 6, 2018 in Cape Canaveral, Fla.\" data-credit=\"Getty Images\" data-mep=\"2442816\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=3000%2C2015%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=630%2C423&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F83acc065c7704081b2ee9c4f0d1867d8%2F206119096%2Fthe-spacex-falcon-heavy-rocket-lifts-off-from-launch-pad-39a-at-on-picture-id915068784&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=b574f7763bf8511cdb8bf1e5672881e7ea71a460\" /></p><p>Every time a grand achievement in space exploration occurs, the feat summons a predictable chorus of critics decrying the supposed waste that such a spectacle represents. And this event was no exception, as Nathan Robinson quickly wrote in <em>The Guardian</em>, in a piece titled<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/07/elon-musk-spacex-launch-utterly-depressing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Why Elon Musk's SpaceX launch is utterly depressing</a></em>: \"If we examine the situation honestly, and get past our natural (and accurate) feeling that rockets are really cool, it becomes hard to defend a project like this.\"</p><p>The launch was an easy target: a rich playboy spends hundreds of millions of dollars to put his private sports car into space. The intent of the spectacle was to demonstrate Musk's capability to put an enormous payload into orbit and beyond: critical for potentiating the next great steps in the commercialization and exploration of deep space.</p><p>Robinson's arguments are not new. With every space launch come the cries of disgust that money and resources are expended to expel materials from the world, while crises remain unaddressed here on the ground. In essence, the plea is one for rational priorities that rank the alleviation of human suffering above what Robinson describes as \"indulgent projects\" that only confirm that \"rockets are really cool.\"</p><blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote\">If the SpaceX venture is an \"indefensible waste of resources,\" as Robinson claims, then what of other frivolous industries, like entertainment?</span></blockquote><p>Years ago, actor Ashton Kutcher appeared on Bill Maher's TV show to complain about the new Mars rover, about how we shouldn't be putting \"stuff on Mars\" when there is still \"child slavery\" here on Earth. The implications are twofold: first that we are somehow incapable of doing both things &mdash; addressing human crises here on Earth while simultaneously exploring the heavens; and second that if we did not do the latter, then the money saved would be redirected to service the former.</p><p>Leave aside the hypocrisy of a wealthy critic like Kutcher, whose <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/lifestyle/celebrity-money/ashton-kutcher-net-worth/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$200-million net worth</a> could be redirected to rescue countless child slaves, and whose <a href=\"https://www.space.com/14961-ashton-kutcher-virgin-galactic-space-ride.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">purchase of a ticket to be a space tourist</a> might be in conflict with his seeming anti-space and anti-equity stance. The real issue that Robinson brings up is one of the need to address wealth inequality. The specific injustices to which he alluded &mdash; insecure housing, health care and education &mdash; are essentially issues of poverty.</p><p>It is important to note that on a global level, there is compelling evidence that <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/news/international/21719790-going-will-be-much-harder-now-world-has-made-great-progress\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">poverty is declining</a>. <a href=\"https://qz.com/1082231/chinas-path-out-of-poverty-can-never-be-repeated-at-scale-by-any-other-country/\" rel=\"nofollow\">China alone reduced its poverty rate</a> from nearly 90 per cent in 1981 to under two per cent today. It bothers a good leftist like me to admit, but China accomplished this Herculean feat by embracing market reforms. A brand of modern capitalism has lifted more people out of poverty than any other force in human history.</p><p><img alt=\"A Tesla roadster launched from the Falcon Heavy rocket with a dummy driver named Starman.\" data-caption=\"A Tesla roadster launched from the Falcon Heavy rocket with a dummy driver named Starman.\" data-credit=\"Handout via Getty Images\" data-mep=\"2442817\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=1920%2C1080%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=630%2C354&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F674f021238ad7ea72e1dd49be3672afd%2F206112750%2Fin-this-handout-photo-provided-by-spacex-a-tesla-roadster-launched-picture-id915868956&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=315d9a0fdb55a4639b19d285fabea9a450d06652\" /></p><p>The NASA budget is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA\" rel=\"nofollow\">just under $20 billion</a>. The latest valuation of Elon Musk's SpaceX company <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/news/spacex-now-valued-21-billion/\" rel=\"nofollow\">is about $21 billion</a>. This is comparable to the size of a major airline, like United, which holds assets worth about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines\" rel=\"nofollow\">$39 billion</a>. If the SpaceX venture is an \"indefensible waste of resources,\" as Robinson claims, then what of other frivolous industries, like entertainment? <a href=\"https://www.stock-analysis-on.net/NYSE/Company/Walt-Disney-Co/Valuation/Ratios\" rel=\"nofollow\">Disney is valued at about $160 billion</a>. But the endless production of Marvel movies, each the price of a space mission, is not seen as frivolous, since they employee hundreds and generate rivers of downstream wealth.</p><p>If we apply that same standard to the space exploration industry, a similar narrative emerges. A<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v355/n6356/pdf/355105a0.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"> 1992 article</a> in <i>Nature</i> estimated these economic benefits to the American taxpayer wrought by the space program: $21.6 billion in sales and benefits, 352,000 (mostly skilled) jobs created or saved, $355 million in federal corporate income taxes, $95 billion in economic activity and $1.5 billion return on investment in the form of sold commercial goods and services.</p><blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote\">If it unfolds as many hope, space exploration shall be our salvation &mdash; economically, spiritually, technologically and possibly even ecologically.</span></blockquote><p>Elon Musk's space venture is primarily a for-profit commercial venture. However, it produces wealth and income for hundreds of employees and thousands of downstream benefactors. It creates new technologies, some of them with the potential to help free us from environment-wasting fossil fuel dependence. Musk's venture creates entire new sectors and a career pipeline for young scientists seeking to create more value, multiplying across future generations. All of this amounts to increased societal wealth, limitedly concentrated; in other words, if well-managed, his venture contributes incrementally to global poverty reduction.</p><p>So, where is the resource waste that Robinson really needs to scorn and scold? Well, a single new Ford class <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_R._Ford-class_aircraft_carrier\" rel=\"nofollow\">aircraft carrier costs the U.S. taxpayer $10 billion</a>... half the total valuation of SpaceX. And its purpose is not to employ thousands, lift thousands more out of poverty, combat environmental degradation, explore the universe or train young scientists. Its purpose is to kill people.</p><blockquote><h2><strong>More from HuffPost Canada:</strong></h2><br /><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/russ-blinch/dear-elon-musk-please-save-toronto-transit-from-itself_a_23043646?utm_campaign=canada_dau\" target=\"_hplink\">Dear Elon Musk: Please Save Toronto Transit From Itself</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/amyrose-lane/private-space-companies_b_8821120.html?utm_campaign=canada_dau\" target=\"_hplink\">The Privatization Of Space Offers A New Hope For Humanity</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/reggie-ramone/elon-musk-tony-stark_b_8962358.html?utm_campaign=canada_dau\" target=\"_hplink\">Elon Musk Truly Is A Modern Day Tony Stark</a></li></ul></blockquote><p>I implore critics like Mr. Robinson to turn their attention to the sector that consistently wastes the largest proportion of public resources for no greater virtue than mass murder: military overspending.
