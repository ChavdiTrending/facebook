While it saw a decent upward trend in the Indian domestic box office, the film saw a considerable dip in the overseas market. If you recollect, on day 1, <em>Aiyaary</em> had raked in Rs 2.68 crore at the international market. However, it could manage to collect Rs 1.89 crore on day 2. And even though this higher than what <em>Naam Shabana</em> managed to earn at the international box office, we had some more expectations from <em>Aiyaary</em>. Trade analyst Taran Adarsh gave us a breakdown of collections, when he tweeted, &#8220;#Aiyaary &#8211; OVERSEAS. Fri $ 419,000.\u00a0Sat $ 292,000.\u00a0Total: $ 711,000 [Rs 4.57 crore]. 2-day biz is 40% higher than #NaamShabana in international markets.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sidharth Malhotra &#8211; Rakul Preet Singh&#8217;s <em>Aiyaary</em> had performed well in USA and UAE-GCC, but with <a href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/tag/black-panther\"><em>Black Panther</em></a> taking over the box office, the Bollywood release was affected. In fact, the film has not impressed the audience too. The poor execution of the subject and the flawed screenplay in <em>Aiyaary</em> also left the audience unhappy. The critics weren&#8217;t too pleased with the film too.\u00a0All this gave rise to a negative word of mouth publicity, which in turn caused the footfalls to decrease and an adverse effect on the box office collections. <em><strong>(ALSO READ &#8211;\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/black-panther-thrashes-aiyaary-at-the-box-office-on-day-2/\">Black Panther THRASHES Aiyaary at the box office on day 2</a>)</strong></em></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tO_WyWqI5bk\" width=\"600\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know, <em>Aiyaary</em> revolves around the story of an Indian army officer (Sidharth Malhotra), who goes rogue after discovering about the inefficiencies and malpractices in the defence forces. His mentor (Manoj Bajpayee) tries hard to find and capture him, but will he be successful? Or will he end up discovering something else? Well, that&#8217;s something you will find out only when you watch the movie. And though this story seems interesting on paper, director Neeraj Pandey could not pull it off. Extra, unwanted elements and the confusing progression in the story made the audience frustrated. Anyway, what is your take on the film? Share with us your reviews in the comments section below!

Recently, we had spotted Kat with a tattoo on her arm which\u00a0made everyone guess if she was sporting one for Thugs and now this.\u00a0 Fatima was recently snapped after her workout session in\u00a0Mumbai and there was something totally different about her eyebrows. A part of her eyebrows look shaved, like you do when you are getting a piercing done. But it looks\u00a0completely badass. Though we love the look, we can&#8217;t help but wonder what caused it.\u00a0Is it a part of\u00a0her look for the film or did she have a minor accident on the sets?</p>\n<p>But this is also not the first time that she has been seen\u00a0with those eyebrows. Remember when Aamir got trolled after his selfie with Kat and Fatima? The actress was sporting the semi-shaved eyebrows in that particular pic, too. We are certain that\u00a0it has something to do with her role in the film. A\u00a0couple of pictures had been leaked from the sets of the show which left Aamir very upset. We&#8217;re kind of surprised no one noticed her eyebrow\u00a0before.

While he has been working on the pre-production work for Ranveer Singh&#8217;s<em> Simmba</em>, the filmmaker has also been working on another special project simultaneously. Rohit was working on a special installment of the <em>Singham</em> franchise and we are quite excited to present to you its first promo right here. The filmmaker, in association with Discovery Kids and Reliance Animation, has made an animated TV series titled <em>Little Singham</em>. Though there were talks of <em>Singham 3</em> being made pretty soon, Rohit Shetty has come out with an animated series revolving around India&#8217;s youngest cop, Little Singham. The trailer of the animated was released today (February 18) and we have to say it will surely make you nostalgic about Ajay Devgn&#8217;s <em>Singham</em>.</p>\n<p>Not only is <em>Little Singham</em> heavily inspired from the film franchise, but we see the little cop act and deliver dialogues in the trailer like <a href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/celeb/ajay-devgn\">Ajay Devgn</a>. The famous <em>Singham</em> pose and the popular dialogue &#8220;aata maajhi sataklee&#8221; also makes it to the\u00a0first promo. The action, comedy and everything else looking really fantastic and we can&#8217;t wait to see this one. The small kids have always loved <em>Singham</em>, so we are sure the kids will love this new series too.

The two had never spoken about their relationship at all. Well,\u00a0we can&#8217;t remember the last time Adi addressed the media at all.\u00a0In the recent episode of Vogue BFF, Rani made an appearance with her designer best friend, Sabyasachi. When Neha Dhupia asked her about her first meeting with Adi, Rani said, &#8220;&#8216;After having faced failure for a couple of my films, luckily Mujhse Dosti Karoge happened and that\u2019s when I met Adi first time professionally. He told me that I\u2019m doing a couple of crap films and that people have pressured him not to take me because they think you don\u2019t have the equity for a Yash Raj film but Adi had belief in my talent and me and thought that I was good for the part.

The ambitious film is all set to kickstart soon, but before that the duo are prepping for the film. And looks like they are having a great time together. In fact, they are quite excited to start the film and this selfie, taken during their rehearsals, is proof. In the picture, we see Ranbir and Alia not able to contain their happiness as they pose together with their trainer Jonathan Fletcher.</p>\n<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know, Alia and Ranbir will be doing some insane, high octane action sequences in <a href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/this-actress-will-play-the-deadly-villain-in-alia-bhatt-and-ranbir-kapoors-brahmastra/\"><em>Brahmastra</em></a>. And hence, they are training with Jonathan. Both of them are learning certain sorts of movements that will aid them in performing the stunts with ease and without causing any injury. The trainer\u00a0is a student of Ido Portal or movement culture. Jonathan also knows several kinds of treatments and yoga. So Alia and Ranbir will surely be taking in all of his knowledge. The duo will train for 15 days together, post which they will return and start shooting along with Amitabh Bachchan. Mouni Roy, who plays a negative character in the movie, is also training with RK and Alia. <em><strong>(ALSO READ &#8211;\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/amitabh-bachchan-confirms-that-brahmastra-will-go-on-the-floors-next-month-view-pic/\">Amitabh Bachchan confirms that Brahmastra will go on the floors next month\u00a0&#8211; view pic!</a>)</strong></em></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BfP2pfjgnkS/\" data-instgrm-version=\"8\">\n<div style=\"padding: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background: #F8F8F8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 62.4537037037037% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;\"></div>\n<p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\"><a style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BfP2pfjgnkS/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Training with Ranbir Kapoor and Aliaa Bhatt in preparation for the biggest Bollywood movie ever!

And while it was going to be a neck and neck battle, looks like <em>Black Panther</em> has thrashed <em>Aiyaary</em> at the Indian domestic box office. In fact, after the Hollywood film had crushed the Bollywood release on day 1, we expected <em>Aiyaary</em> to fight back on day 2. And even though both the films saw decent upward trend, it was <em>Black Panther</em> that emerged as the winner on day 2 once again! If you look at the second day figures, you will realise what we are trying to say. While <em>Black Panther</em> raked in Rs 6.65 crore through nearly 1000 screens on Saturday, <em>Aiyaary</em> collected just Rs 4.04 crore through 1750 screens. Surprising isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n<p>With a wider screen space, we always expected <em>Aiyaary</em> to earn more. However, the film&#8217;s flawed screenplay and poor execution let it down. Revolving around the story of a rogue Indian army officer (<a href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/celeb/sidharth-malhotra\">Sidharth Malhotra</a>) and his mentor (Manoj Bajpayee), <em>Aiyaary</em> had a interesting plot. But director Neeraj Pandey added a lot of unwanted elements and made the story confusing for the audience. This left them unimpressed and gave rise to a poor word of mouth publicity. <em><strong>(ALSO READ &#8211;\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/black-panther-crushes-aiyaary-at-the-indian-box-office-on-day-one/\">Black Panther CRUSHES Aiyaary at the Indian box office on day one</a>)</strong></em></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tO_WyWqI5bk\" width=\"600\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><em>Black Panther</em>, on the other hand, impressed one and all. Revolving around the story of T&#8217;Challa (Chadwick Boseman) after he returns to Wakanda to take the crown after his father&#8217;s death, the Marvel movie has been praised for its fantastic execution, the stunning visuals, intriguing plot and the amazing performances.

He feels that to achieve a global impact and for Indian cinema to progress, fellow filmmakers need to go beyond themselves and focus on the industry.\u00a0The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in partnership with Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) is participating at the European Film Market from February 16-18 in Berlin. The Indian delegation, which also consists of filmmakers like Jahnu Barua and Shaji Karun, is being led by Karan.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I am having a great time. This is a fantastic coming together of people and exploring possibilities of what we can do with Europe. This is like the beginning of a new era in cinema. I am glad that the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting is supporting the cause with CII to make sure that we have this kind of global interaction,&#8221; Karan told IANS over phone from Berlin.\u00a0While he is excited about his presence there, some of the netizens are not. They thought that Padmaavat director Sanjay Leela Bhansali would have been a better fit.

I have always quietly done my own thing whether it is speaking at colleges or attending World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos or film festivals in places like Toronto.\u00a0I will do my own thing, no matter what people say. There will always be haters on social media but I am one of those few filmmakers who has spoken about Indian cinema on a global platform. I never talk about myself there. I talk about what I represent.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In fact, Karan says he would be happy if Indian filmmakers like Rajkumar Hirani or Bhansali travelled to different places and spoke about Indian cinema.\u00a0But at a time of digital boom, how important is it to have an Indian presence at international film festivals?\u00a0&#8220;It is very critical. Many filmmakers travel but we need more of mainstream voices. There is no way that we can achieve that global impact, if we just think about ourselves.\u00a0You have to look at the industry as a holistic force, and not as an individual&#8217;s work. We tend to do only that. We have to get over ourselves and go beyond ourselves if we need our cinema to progress the way it has to,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Karan shared that he moderated a panel at the ongoing Berlin International Film Festival.\u00a0\u00a0&#8220;We discussed that we are open for business and we also spoke about how Indian cinema has come of age&#8230; the new age content. Indian filmmakers are pushing the envelope. There are misconceptions around Indian cinema that has time and again been proven wrong in the last decade and beyond, that we are not just a song and dance film-making nation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He continues, &#8220;Someone asked me &#8216;Are you still running around trees&#8217;? I am like these misconceptions are almost annoying now because many films have broken new ground and are continuing to leave an impact in Europe,&#8221; said the owner of the popular banner Dharma Productions.\u00a0Sharing examples, he said: &#8220;Films like The Lunchbox did phenomenally well in Europe, what&#8217;s happening in China with Aamir Khan&#8217;s film Dangal, and a Telugu film like Baahubal which went about breaking new grounds. There are several films that are being spoken about.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have an official selection (at Berlin) of a film called Garbage by Q. It&#8217;s really exciting. I think many more films should go to festivals in Berlin, Cannes and Toronto. We have to constantly up the game in terms of global participation.&#8221;\u00a0But the audience often sees a gap between Hindi cinema and film festivals.\u00a0&#8220;I think that the gap is reducing. There&#8217;s always alternate and mainstream. These divides are just made as &#8216;terminology divide&#8217;. For example, Newton is a wonderful human story. If you see Dangal, which is a huge commercial success, is a lovely human saga.\u00a0These are parameters that we make that &#8216;this is an art house or this is commercial&#8217;. No, these are films with stories. If they are beautiful, they will connect with the audience irrespective of whether it is at a festival or cinema hall.&#8221;</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/karan-johar-at-berlin-international-film-festival-i-would-be-happy-if-sanjay-leela-bhansali-was-here/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\n\t<enclosure url='http://www.bollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/photos/2017/05/979884.jpg' type='image/jpg' />\n\t\t<articletype>Article</articletype>\n\n\t\t<categoryBadge><![CDATA[News & Gossip]]></categoryBadge>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>PadMan box office collection day 9: Akshay Kumar&#8217;s film witnesses a slight upward trend, rakes in Rs 68.12 crore</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/padman-box-office-collection-day-9-akshay-kumars-film-witnesses-a-slight-upward-trend-rakes-in-rs-68-12-crore/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/padman-box-office-collection-day-9-akshay-kumars-film-witnesses-a-slight-upward-trend-rakes-in-rs-68-12-crore/#respond</comments>\n            \t\t<pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 09:50:32 +0000</pubDate>\n            \t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Karan Shah]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News & Gossip]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Trade News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Akshay Kumar]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[padman]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Padman box office collection]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Padman collection]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[R Balki]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Radhika Apte]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Sonam Kapoor]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.bollywoodlife.com/?p=1161403</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Even though Sidharth Malhotra's Aiyaary and Marvel's Black Panther have hit the screens and reduced PadMan's screen space, the Akshay Kumar starrer continues to rake in the moolah at the domestic box office!]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/celeb/akshay-kumar\">Akshay Kumar</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/celeb/radhika-apte\">Radhika Apte</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/celeb/sonam-kapoor\">Sonam Kapoor</a>&#8216;s <em>PadMan</em> is unstoppable at the box office. Even though Sidharth Malhotra&#8217;s <em>Aiyaary</em> and Marvel&#8217;s <em>Black Panther</em> have hit the screens and reduced <em>PadMan</em>&#8216;s screen space, the Akshay Kumar starrer continues to rake in the moolah. On day 9, <em>PadMan</em> saw a slight upward trend again, as it raked in Rs 3.15 crore at the domestic box office. This takes the film&#8217;s tally to Rs 68.12 crore. As trade analyst Taran Adarsh revealed on Twitter, &#8220;#PadMan is steady at lower levels. [Week 2] Fri Rs 2.10 crore, Sat Rs 3.15 crore. Total: Rs 68.12 crore. India biz.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/fir-filed-against-akshay-kumars-pad-man-over-plagiarism-the-complainant-demands-justice/\"><em>PadMan</em></a> has impressed one and all. Not only has the story connected with one and all; but the execution, the hard hitting message and Akshay Kumar&#8217;s fantastic performance has impressed the audience. The movie goers and even the critics can&#8217;t stop gushing about the movie. Our film critic and Editor &#8211; in &#8211; Chief, Tushar P Joshi also mentioned in his review, &#8220;Akshay Kumar delivers one of his finest performance in a film that breaks social taboos and stereotypes with finesse.\u00a0Sanitary napkins and menstruation aren\u2019t the most likely subjects to make a full-length feature film. But R Balki\u2019s <em>PadMan</em> does the unthinkable and weaves a real-life inspired story that holds your attention for most of its screen time.&#8221; This positive word of mouth publicity has not only enabled the film to sustain so well at the box office, but also earn such an impressive amount. <em><strong>(ALSO READ &#8211;\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/twinkle-khanna-on-pad-mans-ban-in-pakistan-women-menstruate-no-matter-where-you-put-a-boundary/\">Twinkle Khanna on PadMan&#8217;s ban in Pakistan: Women menstruate no matter where you put a boundary</a>)</strong></em></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6wtwIk7y6yQ\" width=\"600\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>We are sure <em>PadMan</em> will again eat into <em>Aiyaary</em> and <em>Black Panther</em>&#8216;s business on Sunday. However, post Monday, it will see a considerable dip and end up with a lifetime collection of Rs 75 &#8211; 80 crore. Anyway, what did you guys think about the movie?
