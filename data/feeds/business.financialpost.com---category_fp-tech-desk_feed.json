Inside are work spaces, dubbed &#8220;pods,&#8221; also made with a lot&nbsp;of glass. Apple staff are often glued to the&nbsp;iPhones&nbsp;they helped popularize. That&#8217;s resulted in repeated cases of distracted employees walking into the&nbsp;panes, according to people familiar with the incidents.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/investing/apple-ceo-downplays-special-dividend-says-hes-not-really-a-fan-at-shareholder-meeting\">Apple CEO downplays special dividend, says he\u2019s \u2018not really a fan\u2019 at shareholder meeting</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/technology/personal-tech/apples-homepod-sounds-great-but-siri-integration-needs-work-early-reviews-say\">Apple\u2019s HomePod sounds great, but Siri integration needs work, early reviews say</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/technology/the-only-electricity-we-use-is-one-lamp-apple-execs-facebook-billionaires-embrace-tech-diets-for-devices-services-they-helped-create\">\u2018The only electricity we use is one lamp\u2019: Apple execs, Facebook billionaires embrace tech diets for devices, services they helped create</a></li></ul>\n<p>Some staff started to stick Post-It notes on the glass doors&nbsp;to mark their presence. However, the notes were removed because they detracted from the building&#8217;s design, the&nbsp;people said. They asked not to be identified discussing anything related to Apple. Another person familiar with the situation said there are other markings to identify&nbsp;the glass.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s latest campus has been&nbsp;lauded as an architectural marvel. The building, crafted&nbsp;by famed architect Norman Foster, immortalized a vision that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs had years earlier. In 2011, Jobs reportedly described the building &#8220;a little like a spaceship landed.&#8221; Jobs has been&nbsp;credited for coming up with the glass pods, designed to mix&nbsp;solo&nbsp;office areas with more social spaces.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;building is designed to house some 13,000 employees. Wired magazine, first to pay a visit at its opening last year, described&nbsp;the structure&nbsp;as a &#8220;statement of openness, of free movement,&#8221; in contrast&nbsp;to Apple&#8217;s typically insular culture.&nbsp;&#8220;While it is a technical marvel to make glass at this scale, that&#8217;s not the achievement,&#8221; Jony&nbsp;Ive, Apple&#8217;s design chief, told the magazine in May.&nbsp;&#8220;The achievement is to make a building where so many people can connect and collaborate and walk and talk.&#8221;</p>\n<p>An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. It&#8217;s not clear how many incidents there have been. A Silicon Valley-based spokeswoman for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration referred questions about Apple&#8217;s workplace safety record to the government agency&#8217;s website. A search on the site based on&nbsp;Apple&#8217;s name&nbsp;in California found no reports of injuries at the company&#8217;s new campus.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not the first time Apple&#8217;s penchant for glass in buildings has caused problems. In late 2011, 83-year-old Evelyn Paswall walked into the glass wall of an Apple store, breaking her nose. She sued the company, arguing it&nbsp;should have posted a warning&nbsp;on the glass. The suit was settled without&nbsp;any cost to Apple, according to a legal filing in early 2013.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com\"><em>Bloomberg.com</em></a></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://business.financialpost.com/technology/apples-new-spaceship-campus-has-one-flaw-and-it-hurts/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<postmedia:alexa><![CDATA[Apple's new spaceship campus has a painful flaw \u2014 distracted employees keep smacking into its glass.

The question currently rattling the town\u2019s council is just how much the industry has to offer Powerview-Pine Falls.</p>\n<p>Cryptocurrency mining, once the marginal interest of a small coterie of investors, has barged into mainstream consciousness in recent months thanks to massive gains in the price of digital coins.</p>\n<p>These virtual currencies \u2014 and there are thousands, with bitcoin the biggest among them \u2014 allow parties to directly exchange value. In lieu of a central regulating authority such as a bank, each transaction is verified on a digital public ledger known as a blockchain.</p>\n<p>This is where the miners come in. While investors buy cryptocurrencies on exchanges, miners attempt to earn them by using high-powered computers to solve the complex cryptographic puzzles that enable a transaction to be verified and added to the blockchain. The first miner to unravel each puzzle is rewarded with a stash of newly issued virtual coins.</p>\n<p>It may seem dauntingly technical, but in some ways the practice is no more complicated than \u201cpanning for gold in a river,\u201d said Sophie Lu, head of China research for Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) in Beijing.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPeople get bamboozled because it\u2019s computers and data and fancy technology, but actually the mining portion of it is just brute force,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the least sophisticated computing style you can imagine. The computers are guessing numbers. The more computers you have, the more guesses you get and whoever guesses the right number first gets the bitcoin.\u201d</p>\n<p>In one sense, it\u2019s like an elaborate arcade game, but cryptocurrency mining has become a massive \u2014 if volatile \u2014 business.</p>\n<p>The value of all outstanding virtual currencies soared to US$800 billion in January before falling by more than half, according to Coinmarketcap.com. A single bitcoin, worth nothing eight years ago, commanded US$9,860 as of Thursday.</p>\n<p>The jump in coin values has brought a rush of new miners into the business, all anxious to lock down a cheap source of energy to operate and cool their power-hungry computers.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1544329\" style=\"max-width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/fp0215-pineview-satellite.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1544329\" data-permalink=\"http://business.financialpost.com/technology/blockchain/towns-hopeful-but-cautious-as-crypto-miners-flood-into-canada/attachment/fp0215-pineview-satellite\" data-orig-file=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/fp0215-pineview-satellite.png\" data-orig-size=\"1000,750\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"fp0215-pineview-satellite\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/fp0215-pineview-satellite.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/fp0215-pineview-satellite.png?w=640\" class=\"wp-image-1544329 size-large\" src=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/fp0215-pineview-satellite.png?w=640&#038;h=480\" alt=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"640\" srcset=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/fp0215-pineview-satellite.png?w=640&amp;h=480 640w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/fp0215-pineview-satellite.png?w=150&amp;h=113 150w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/fp0215-pineview-satellite.png?w=300&amp;h=225 300w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/fp0215-pineview-satellite.png?w=768&amp;h=576 768w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/fp0215-pineview-satellite.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A satellite image of Powerview-Pine Falls, Man. on the Winnipeg River.

And if we could have any part of it \u2026 well it\u2019s exciting to think they\u2019re coming to us.\u201d</p>\n<p>What could go wrong? Plenty, analysts say. For starters, with so many interested parties rushing the gates, hydro officials, property agents and towns are struggling to understand the crypto-mining business while trying to separate its serious players from its rogues.</p>\n<p>Hydro Quebec\u2019s 2016 campaign to sell surplus hydro to data centres \u2014 intended to attract headline companies such as Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. \u2014 unexpectedly netted more than 100 calls from digital currency miners.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t say they were all serious,\u201d said Jonathan C\u00f4t\u00e9, spokesperson for the utility. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a gold rush feeling with some of them and they aren\u2019t all well organized. We\u2019re interested, but we are being cautious. Who are these people, are they well capitalized and do they have the funding to follow through?\u201d</p>\n<p>But many of the risks of cryptocurrency mining are baked into the business itself.</p>\n<p>In the fast-moving digital mining world, prices can rise and fall in a matter of days. The computers used to crunch through puzzles can become obsolete in as little as a year and mining operations can quickly become unprofitable if more efficient new models cannot be obtained, or if the price of power edges up.</p>\n<p>Though larger operators such as Hut 8 said their scale allows them to make money in spite of such fluctuations, smaller players are particularly vulnerable.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf prices go up, it\u2019s really not that hard for that mining facility to up and leave,\u201d Lu said. \u201cAll these facilities need is a cooling fan and a grid connection and everybody is competing on energy costs. So in the space of a year, you can attract a bunch of these things, but in the space of two years, they can be gone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beyond concerns about volatility, questions remain about what benefits cryptocurrencies bring to the communities that host them.</p>\n<p>A mining facility \u2014 which can range from a purpose-built structure to a series of shipping containers filled with computers \u2014 would likely bring in property tax revenue, but increased employment and other local spinoffs aren\u2019t as certain.</p>\n<p>Here, China offers a cautionary tale, Lu said. A couple of years ago, cryptocurrency miners were welcomed into a group of smaller Chinese towns, where large, stable power supplies were among the vestiges of defunct textile mills.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1544204\" style=\"max-width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/fp0215-gs-bitfarms.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1544204\" data-permalink=\"http://business.financialpost.com/technology/blockchain/towns-hopeful-but-cautious-as-crypto-miners-flood-into-canada/attachment/fp0215-gs-bitfarms\" data-orig-file=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/fp0215-gs-bitfarms.png\" data-orig-size=\"1000,750\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"fp0215-gs-bitfarms\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/fp0215-gs-bitfarms.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/fp0215-gs-bitfarms.png?w=640\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1544204\" src=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/fp0215-gs-bitfarms.png?w=640&#038;h=480\" alt=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"640\" srcset=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/fp0215-gs-bitfarms.png?w=640&amp;h=480 640w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/fp0215-gs-bitfarms.png?w=150&amp;h=113 150w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/fp0215-gs-bitfarms.png?w=300&amp;h=225 300w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/fp0215-gs-bitfarms.png?w=768&amp;h=576 768w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/fp0215-gs-bitfarms.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Workers check fans on mining machines at the Bitfarms cryptocurrency farming facility in Farnham, Que.</p></div>\n<p>Following the lead of China\u2019s central government, which had been promoting the construction of data centres as a route to innovation, local authorities offered the miners preferential tax rates, free facilities and other perks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen about six months ago they began to realize their local economy wasn\u2019t getting anything from this,\u201d Lu said.</p>\n<p>A typical cryptocurrency mine employed just 50 workers and all profits went back to the owners, who were often offshore investors.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that it wouldn\u2019t bring any benefit to the town, but it won\u2019t bring much,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Worried about building assets only to see them stranded, Manitoba Hydro and Hydro Quebec both say miners will have to pay for any necessary studies, upgrades or modifications to the power infrastructure.

Founded in July, it hopes to employ 300 more workers in 2018.</p>\n<p>Hut 8, which is backed by crypto-mining giant BitFury Group Ltd., employs 40 people in Drumheller and will grow to 1,000 workers when its expansion is complete, chief executive Clark said. Though the company\u2019s machines are housed in 40-foot shipping containers rather than a permanent structure, he said there is nothing flighty in his approach.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe want to be a utility-sized player verifying transactions on the blockchain,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are long-term players who believe in this business and know that scale will ultimately win this game.\u201d</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, as the price of bitcoin rises and falls exponentially \u2014 rising from US$1,000 per coin in January 2017 to an all-time high of US$19,499 in December \u2014 market skepticism has grown.</p>\n<p>Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has called bitcoin \u201ca real bubble\u201d while economist Nouriel Roubini has dismissed cryptocurrencies as a \u201cscam.\u201d</p>\n<p>But for Lu and others, the question is not whether digital currencies will implode and disappear, but which players will thrive through the early booms and busts of the industry.</p>\n<p>\u201cCryptocurrencies began with bitcoin, but they won\u2019t end with bitcoin,\u201d Lu said. \u201cAs long as there are enough tech billionaires willing to store wealth in cryptocurrencies, they\u2019ll survive. What matters for the real economy is how people manage to position themselves in the supply chain in order to benefit from them.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In Powerview-Pine Falls, the town council has made plans to meet with provincial officials later in February in hopes of creating an \u201caction plan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Councillors are reading up on blockchain and watching documentaries on cryptocurrencies. But collaborating with other towns has been difficult, given the secrecy of the negotiations involved and the growing competition among some areas to win investment.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re excited, but we want to be careful and get the best deal possible,\u201d Dub\u00e9 said. \u201cMaybe this doesn\u2019t come into the community and create jobs, but there could be a land purchase or lease or maybe some publicity.

The retailer&#8217;s online sales have been on a tear for the last three consecutive quarters, far outpacing wider industry growth levels.</p>\n<p>Powering that rise are thousands of proprietary servers that enable the company to crunch almost limitless swathes of customer data in-house.</p>\n<ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/walmart-makes-a-late-entry-into-the-e-book-market\">Walmart takes aim at another of Amazon\u2019s core businesses in e-book push, but it might already be too late</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/hudsons-bay-shares-plummet-after-retailer-reports-lower-sales-almost-doubled-losses\">\u2018They are now way behind Amazon and Walmart\u2019: Challenges mount at Hudson\u2019s Bay as losses almost double</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/wal-mart-to-change-name-to-reflect-shift-from-bricks-and-mortar-to-increasing-emphasis-on-online-sales\">Wal-Mart to change name to reflect shift from bricks and mortar to increasing emphasis on online sales</a></li></ul>\n<p>Most retailers rent the computing capacity they need to store and manage such information. But Walmart&#8217;s decision to build its own internal cloud network shows its determination to grab a bigger slice of online shopping, in part by imitating Amazon&#8217;s use of cloud-powered big data to drive digital sales.</p>\n<p>The effort is helping Walmart to stay competitive with Amazon on pricing and to tightly control key functions such as inventory. And it is allowing the company to target shoppers with more customized offers and improved services, two top executives told Reuters in interviews at Walmart&#8217;s San Bruno and Sunnyvale campuses in California.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It has made a big difference to how fast we can grow our e-commerce business,&#8221; said Tim Kimmet, head of cloud operations for Walmart.</p>\n<p>He said Walmart, for example, is using cloud data to stock items frequently ordered by customers via voice shopping devices such as Google Home.</p>\n<p>The network is helping the retailer improve its in-store operations as well. Using data gleaned from millions of transactions, the company sped up the process by which customers can return online purchases to their local stores by 60 per cent. And Walmart can adjust prices at its physical locations almost instantly across entire regions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are now able to execute change faster,&#8221; Jeremy King, Walmart&#8217;s chief technology officer, told Reuters. He added that Walmart can now make over 170,000 monthly changes to software that supports its website, compared to less than 100 changes previously.</p>\n<p>To be sure, Walmart, the world&#8217;s largest brick-and-mortar retailer, holds just a 3.6 per cent share of the U.S. e-commerce market compared to Amazon&#8217;s 43.5 per cent, according to digital research firm eMarketer.</p>\n<p>Still, Walmart&#8217;s cloud effort is significant at a time when U.S. retail is undergoing immense disruption, and data-based decision making has become more important than ever to understand how shoppers make purchases.</p>\n<p>Walmart&#8217;s online revenue climbed 50 per cent year-over-year during the third quarter, helping it post its strongest-ever quarterly growth since 2009.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The battle between Walmart and Amazon has been playing out on all fronts and the cloud is the latest frontier,&#8221; said Kerry Liu, chief executive of Rubikloud Technologies, which offers artificial intelligence technology services to retailers.</p>\n<h3><strong>EXCESS CAPACITY</strong></h3>\n<p>The cloud initiative is but one of several steps Wal-Mart is taking to boost its e-commerce business. The company has expanded its online selection and acquired smaller e-commerce retailers. Walmart is offering free two-day shipping on orders of US$35 or more, and it recently asked vendors to supply it with merchandise priced at US$10 and up to help it turn a profit online.</p>\n<p>Walmart has stored information in smaller internal data centers for years. And it uses public cloud storage for non-critical data. Most retailers rent server capacity offered by companies such as Amazon Web Services, Alphabet Inc&#8217;s Google , Microsoft Corp and IBM.</p>\n<p>But Walmart&#8217;s decision to build a network that is not reliant on a single third-party cloud technology provider has transformed its ability to understand shoppers, who now move between store, desktop, mobile and app to make purchases. About 80 per cent of Walmart&#8217;s cloud network is now in-house.</p>\n<p>Walmart&#8217;s Kimmet said security was another big factor behind the effort, enabling the retailer to better protect customer data. That secrecy extends to the locations of its six &#8220;mega clouds&#8221; or giant server farms, and 75 &#8220;micro clouds&#8221; whose locations the company declined to disclose publicly.</p>\n<p>Walmart shareholders so far appear supportive of its cloud strategy. The company&#8217;s shares have risen 49 per cent in the last 12 months, defying the broader retail sector downturn and outperforming the wider S&amp;P 500 index, which has risen 14 per cent over the same period.</p>\n<p>Still, some investors have expressed concerns that Walmart&#8217;s approach will make it harder for the retailer to downsize if market conditions change significantly. A few of them told Reuters they would like to see Walmart commercialize its excess capacity, much as its rival Amazon has done.</p>\n<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) generated US$18.34 billion in revenue in 2017 and has garnered 26 per cent of the cloud market, according to estimates from Jefferies Group LLC.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Walmart is very good at following Amazon&#8217;s innovations. Now they must find a way to monetize the cloud business they are building the way AWS did,&#8221; said Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC, who owns shares of Walmart.</p>\n<p>Walmart&#8217;s Kimmet said the retailer has no immediate plans to provide cloud services for other companies. But he did not rule it out as a future revenue driver.</p>\n<p><em>\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2018</em></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/rpt-focus-walmart-goes-to-the-cloud-to-close-gap-with-amazon/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<postmedia:alexa><![CDATA[The cloud is the latest frontier in Walmart's battle with Amazon for e-commerce domination.

Michael Moody has spent the past three years seeking the answers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8220;My son was actually one of the earliest people to mine it,&#8221; said Moody, a retired software engineer. &#8220;He used his computer at home to mine Bitcoins when you actually could do it that way and he had a few we think.&#8221;</p>\n<ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/what-happens-to-your-bitcoin-when-you-die-digital-assets-complicating-estate-planning-process\">What happens to your Bitcoin when you die?

To each other, a brotherhood</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/technology/blockchain/sex-businesses-are-finding-willing-partners-in-cryptocurrencies\">Where banks balk, sex businesses find willing partners in cryptocurrencies</a></li></ul>\n<p>The decentralized and unregulated nature of Bitcoin means that without the keys to access his son&#8217;s digital wallet, hosted by blockchain.info, Moody has no way of accessing any funds. And it&#8217;s almost impossible to find out whether a person is sitting on peanuts or a fortune, as wallets&nbsp;can contain an unlimited number of unique addresses, or identifiers, with Bitcoins assigned to each.&nbsp;Without knowing every address, it&#8217;s not possible to locate every piece of currency.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Blockchain.info did not respond to requests for comment on this story.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is no authority that could be appealed to fix this,&#8221; Nolan Bauerle, director of research at cryptocurrency analysis website CoinDesk, said of an individual&#8217;s Bitcoin stash becoming inaccessible after they pass away. &#8220;Those coins would be abandoned.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Moody says entrepreneurial young people, unfamiliar with emerging digital currencies, need to be better educated about the steps needed to be taken to ensure their investments are properly secured, both for themselves and for future heirs.</p>\n<h3><strong>Coin Offerings</strong></h3>\n<p>In the 1990s your digital legacy that might have just meant email accounts, but today extends to passwords, encrypted device backups, photo archives, personal data held by search engines, advertisers and social networks &#8212; and now cryptocurrencies. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Issues around inheritance include initial coin offerings, the process of raising money from investors by offering them virtual &#8220;tokens&#8221; instead of shares. In 2017, about US$3.5 billion was raised worldwide from ICOs, according to data compiled by CoinDesk.</p>\n<p>The relatively nascent practice of holding an ICO means legislation is yet to catch up, meaning questions around what happens to a person&#8217;s rightful tokens when they die are numerous. But following a number of lawsuits,&nbsp;U.S. lawmakers will soon decide whether a token acquired from an ICO will be considered no different to a share bought through an IPO.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My bet is that ICOs, when issued by a company, they&#8217;re going to be considered securities,&#8221; said Peter Henning, a professor at Wayne State University Law School and veteran SEC and Justice Department lawyer. &#8220;If they are securities, then just like stock or bonds you can put them in your will and pass them down.&#8221;</p>\n<p>European Central Bank President Mario Draghi&nbsp;said that blockchain technology is &#8220;quite promising&#8221; but that&nbsp;&#8220;the value of Bitcoin oscillates wildly. Of all things, I would not call Bitcoin a currency for this reason.&#8221; He said the ECB remains &#8220;very interested&#8221; in the blockchain, which underpins cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<h3><strong>Bitcoin Security</strong></h3>\n<p>Some firms are beginning to make provisions. CoinBase&nbsp;is&nbsp;a custodial service, which holds a customer&#8217;s private keys &#8212; the kind that if lost would otherwise render any Bitcoins permanently inaccessible &#8212; and as such is able to provide some level of security in the event of a person&#8217;s death. The company asks for documents such as a death certificate and will in order to transfer the assets.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not a solution that some enthusiasts will be keen to use, as the idea of someone else being in custody of Bitcoins is antithetical to decentralized, user-controlled ethos that sparked an interest in the anonymous currency in the first place.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>CoinBase declined to comment for this story.</p>\n<p>The safekeeping of a private key remains the bottleneck regarding the inheritance of Bitcoins. The startup Ledger SAS, which in January raised 61 million euros (US$75&nbsp;million) from investors makes electronic Bitcoin wallets.

The phrase &#8220;the next big game for Xbox&#8221; pops up more than once.</p>\n<p>Studio chief Craig Duncan cuts right to the chase. &#8220;We want <em>Sea of Thieves</em> to be the friendliest, most accessible multiplayer game ever made,&#8221; he says with confidence. &#8220;I want people to still be playing five or even 10 years from now. We&#8217;re in this for the long game.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This might seem like hubris, but his assurance is at least partially founded in numbers.</p>\n<p>When <em>Sea of Thieves</em> entered a beta test period earlier this year, the results were immediate and impressive. Players began streaming their play sessions on Twitch, a popular online service that in many ways measures the pulse of modern game audiences. The game amassed 40 million live streaming viewing hours in just seven days. It quickly climbed the viewing ranks to become the site&#8217;s top streamed game, surpassing longstanding Twitch juggernauts including <em>League of Legends</em> and <em>PlayerUnknown&#8217;s Battlegrounds</em>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When we overtook <em>League of Legends</em> it was like, f&#8211;king hell,&#8221; says the game&#8217;s executive producer, Joe Neat, with a giddy smile. &#8220;People were high-fiving each other in the hallways.&#8221; This positive reaction from the public helped validate the team&#8217;s hard work over the last three-and-a-half years. Could this be the game that finally brings Rare back into the conversation?</p>\n<ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/technology/gaming/nintendo-labo-combines-switch-games-with-interactive-cardboard-toys\">Nintendo Labo is a new series of Switch games with cardboard toys</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/technology/gaming/monster-hunter-world-review-the-monsters-are-intimidating-but-the-game-surprisingly-is-not\">The Monsters are intimidating, but the game -- surprisingly -- is not</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/technology/gaming/14-brand-new-original-non-sequel-games-that-you-can-get-excited-about-in-2018\">14 brand new, original, non-sequel games you can get excited about in 2018</a></li></ul>\n<p>Rare was once a darling developer for Nintendo platforms, thanks to beloved classics including <em>GoldenEye 007</em>, <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>, and <em>Conker&#8217;s Bad Fur Day</em>. It&#8217;s done good business for Microsoft since being acquired by the American giant in 2002, but without delivering much in the way of iconic new properties. After attempting to reboot some of its past franchises, including Perfect Dark and Banjo Kazooie, the studio went to work developing sports games for the now abandoned Kinect motion sensor. It&#8217;s safe to say the team of around 200 developers was ready to get back to making the kinds of games that make studios famous.</p>\n<p>A small group within Rare began brainstorming new ideas in private in 2014. The concept that quickly gained the most traction had a pirate theme and a strong cooperative multiplayer angle. They thought it worked, but it wasn&#8217;t until a group of executives from Redmond \u2013 including Xbox chief Phil Spencer \u2013 came to the studio to try an early prototype that they began to believe they were on to something special.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We recorded them playing the game without telling them,&#8221; says Neat, smiling as he remembers Spencer&#8217;s warm reaction to that early concept. &#8220;And then we sent an edited video to them a week later, and told them this is the first shared experience in <em>Sea of Thieves</em>. And I can honestly say I&#8217;ve never had more confidence in a game&#8217;s vision than I did at that moment.&#8221; &nbsp;</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"1540912\" data-permalink=\"http://business.financialpost.com/technology/gaming/will-rares-sea-of-thieves-be-the-new-exclusive-xbox-one-desperately-needs/attachment/sea-of-thieves-8\" data-orig-file=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-8.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1080\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Sea of Thieves 8\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-8.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-8.jpg?w=640\" class=\"alignright size-large wp-image-1540912\" src=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-8.jpg?w=640&#038;h=360\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-8.jpg?w=640&amp;h=360 640w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-8.jpg?w=1280&amp;h=720 1280w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-8.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-8.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-8.jpg?w=768&amp;h=432 768w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-8.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=576 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"></p>\n<p><em>Things hadn&#8217;t gone according to plan. We&#8217;d dropped anchor and swam ashore aiming to find the crew of the ship we&#8217;d tracked, but ran into skeletons armed with scimitars instead. They kept us occupied while the crew of the other galleon got back aboard their boat and began raining cannon balls onto our ship. Our one remaining shipside crew member was trying to bail water and patch holes with planks, but it was a losing battle. When a third boat appeared from out of the fog, all seemed lost. </em></p>\n<p><em>That&#8217;s when I came up with a desperate idea. I grabbed a red gunpowder barrel the skeletons had been guarding and leapt into the sea, then swam up to a nearby rock that kept me hidden from one of the circling vessels. As the enemy boat approached I began to hear its crew barking orders at each other over my headset. Faintly at first, then more loudly as it grew closer.</em></p>\n<p><em>When it sounded like they were right on top of me I swam out from behind the rock and began a mad dash toward the ship, still clutching the barrel. I wanted to tell my crew what I was up to, but decided to keep radio silence so as not to be detected by my nearby enemies. I reached the ship&#8217;s ladder and began climbing. Then, just as I was about to crest the deck, a bearded face with an eyepatch looked over the edge, pointed a loaded flintlock at me, and fired. </em></p>\n<p><em>The world disappeared in a massive explosion.</em></p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"1540898\" data-permalink=\"http://business.financialpost.com/technology/gaming/will-rares-sea-of-thieves-be-the-new-exclusive-xbox-one-desperately-needs/attachment/sea-of-thieves-6\" data-orig-file=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-6.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1200,750\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Sea of Thieves 6\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-6.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-6.jpg?w=640\" class=\"alignright size-large wp-image-1540898\" src=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-6.jpg?w=640&#038;h=400\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-6.jpg?w=640&amp;h=400 640w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-6.jpg?w=150&amp;h=94 150w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-6.jpg?w=300&amp;h=188 300w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-6.jpg?w=768&amp;h=480 768w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-6.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=640 1024w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-6.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"></p>\n<p><em>Sea of Thieves</em> isn&#8217;t about levelling up and earning more powerful gear. It&#8217;s about emergent stories and shared experiences.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a canvas where players go on adventures together and create memorable experiences,&#8221; says studio head Duncan. &#8220;It&#8217;s about removing boundaries between players, and providing guided goals that bring players together.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You can create parties among your friends, or be matched with other players to create a crew of two or four. Once you have your crew, you decide among yourselves what to do and where to go. You might agree to start off on a &#8220;voyage&#8221; \u2013 the game&#8217;s terminology for a mission, one of countless lightly curated quests set within a vast open world \u2013 but you might just as easily get sidetracked if, say, someone spies the glint of a bottle on a beach, a shipwreck in a cove, or the black sails of another ship full of humans on the horizon (I was told the game is designed so this latter should happen once every 15 or 20 minutes).</p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve claimed booty from one or more of these objectives \u2013 and assuming you don&#8217;t lose it to the cold sea or rival buccaneers \u2013 you can head to an outpost to sell off your treasures and purchase more challenging voyages or a variety of pirate-y duds, from peg legs to brass buckles. Then it starts all over again.</p>\n<p>The truly bold thing about <em>Sea of Thieves</em>&#8216; design is the way in which it keeps its community whole. Downloadable content will be made available to everyone so as not to fracture players into groups of haves and have-nots. And character growth employs a horizontal levelling system, which in non-game designer speak means that one player&#8217;s character will never grow beyond another. A master pirate can be matched up with a rookie and they&#8217;ll both be evenly prepared to take on whatever they encounter.</p>\n<p>At one point the game&#8217;s design director, Mike Chapman, led me through a glass tunnel from Rare&#8217;s main building into one of the studio&#8217;s four developer &#8220;barns,&#8221; where he showed me a screen displaying a cavern reminiscent of the pirate&#8217;s cave near the end of <em>The Goonies</em>, complete with waterfalls, shipwrecks, skeletons, and treasure. Chapman calls this location the &#8220;Hideout.&#8221; It&#8217;s not easy to find, but once you do it&#8217;ll become a new base of operations for you, providing access to &#8220;legendary&#8221; voyages that you can share with your crew, regardless of how experienced they are.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can imagine that the first person who finds the Hideout, maybe a couple of weeks after launch, will become almost a celebrity within the community,&#8221; says Chapman. &#8220;And then people will start sharing what it is and what you need to get there and it will slowly start spreading around the community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The possibility of obtaining this sort of prestige is part of what Rare hopes will drive people to keep playing for weeks, months, and even years. That, and the sense of shared adventure. Moments of companionship, teamwork, and humour that feel familiar to the real world but are enhanced by the imaginative possibilities of the game.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"1540900\" data-permalink=\"http://business.financialpost.com/technology/gaming/will-rares-sea-of-thieves-be-the-new-exclusive-xbox-one-desperately-needs/attachment/sea-of-thieves-9\" data-orig-file=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-9.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1200,675\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Sea of Thieves 9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-9.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-9.jpg?w=640\" class=\"alignright size-large wp-image-1540900\" src=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-9.jpg?w=640&#038;h=360\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-9.jpg?w=640&amp;h=360 640w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-9.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-9.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-9.jpg?w=768&amp;h=432 768w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-9.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=576 1024w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/sea-of-thieves-9.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"></p>\n<p><em>As the world fades back into existence, I realize I&#8217;m on a ship at the bottom of the sea.

There&#8217;s a tipping point which, if reached, opens the floodgates for an ocean of people to begin pouring in.</p>\n<p>Understanding this, Microsoft and Rare are including <em>Sea of Thieves</em> in Microsoft&#8217;s Game Pass program, a Netflix-like subscription service that provides access to more than 100 games for just $12 per month. Anyone who currently subscribes will be able to start playing <em>Sea of Thieves</em> without spending an extra penny, and anyone who wants to give <em>Sea of Thieves</em> a go who doesn&#8217;t currently subscribe to Game Pass can sign up and skip spending $80 on the boxed edition. It&#8217;s a clever way to get a bunch of people playing in a hurry.</p>\n<p>Another barrier the team is tearing down is the wall that typically sits between platforms. If you&#8217;re playing a game on PC, you normally can&#8217;t play with friends playing the same game on Xbox One. But <em>Sea of Thieves</em> sits among a rare group of games that fully supports cross-platform play between Xbox One and Windows PCs. Making it easier to play with pals is a major advantage for a game designed with friendly cooperative play in mind.</p>\n<p>But perhaps the biggest obstacle Rare is trying to tear down is the one that separates people who typically play online games from those who don&#8217;t. Online games tend to attract a certain type of player \u2013 social spirited and often competitive in nature \u2013 while repelling shier and less experienced players, as well as those easily rankled by the kind of foul language and immature behaviours for which online games are notorious. Rare wants both types of players to give <em>Sea of Thieves</em> a shot. And its strategy is to create a sense of fellowship and solidarity among crewmates.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our game champions soft skills rather than hard skills,&#8221; says lead designer Chapman, explaining that <em>Sea of Thieves</em> is engineered to create a bond among players of all experience and skill levels. &#8220;It&#8217;s not about how good you are with a controller. It could even be someone&#8217;s first multiplayer game. It&#8217;s about shared goals and facing emerging threats together. It&#8217;s designed so that there is a natural benefit to playing with others. It&#8217;s always in your best interest to help your crewmates, and for them to help you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To illustrate just how inclusive and accessible <em>Sea of Thieves</em> is, Ted Timmins, the game&#8217;s PC design lead, relates a story about a functionally blind player he met at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles last year. &#8220;He came over and said he really wanted to play,&#8221; says Timmons. &#8220;Once we got him on the ship, he grabbed the wheel. You wouldn&#8217;t think that someone in his position would be able to navigate, but the sails tend to block the view of whoever&#8217;s steering anyway. And <em>Sea of Thieves</em> is about communication. So we told him to go a bit left or a bit right, and he absolutely nailed it every time. It was great. He was a valuable part of the crew.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s this sense of camaraderie and focus on shared experiences that, in the end, might be <em>Sea of Thieves</em>&#8216; greatest strength. The notion that you needn&#8217;t have lightning fast reflexes or the best gear in order to succeed or have fun, but instead simply a willingness to become part of a team standing together to take on, laugh at, and enjoy whatever the game throws at you.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s for anyone who wants to use their imagination,&#8221; says executive producer Neat. &#8220;Really, it&#8217;s for anyone who wants to be a kid again.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Sea of Thieves will launch March 20, 2018 for Xbox One and Windows PC.</em></p>\n<p><em>Descriptions of in-game experiences draw from and amalgamate moments spread across several hours spent playing an alpha version of the game at Rare&#8217;s headquarters with a mix of developers and journalists.</em></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://business.financialpost.com/technology/gaming/will-rares-sea-of-thieves-be-the-new-exclusive-xbox-one-desperately-needs/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<postmedia:alexa><![CDATA[Will Rare's Sea of Thieves be the new exclusive Xbox One desperately needs?.

Even more impressive than its warm reception from critics was its instant and overwhelming appeal to players. It climbed to the top spot in the paid app rankings on Apple Inc.&#8217;s App Store in the U.S. and Canada on its first day, and it went on to reach number one in just about every market and country in the months that followed. It was a smash hit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For a small team like ours, I think we knew inside of 24 hours that we\u2019d made something we considered very successful,&#8221; says Ryan Cash, Snowman&#8217;s founder and CEO. &#8220;The first sign that something special was&nbsp;happening was waking up on our planned launch day and seeing over 500 tweets about the game before even formally announcing that we\u2019d&nbsp;initially&nbsp;released it for&nbsp;iPhone and iPad.&#8221;</p>\n<ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/technology/gaming/dragon-quest-builders-for-switch-review-minecraft-for-less-imaginative-people\">Dragon Quest Builders review: Minecraft for less imaginative people</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/technology/gaming/how-a-two-man-vancouver-team-created-apples-2017-game-of-the-year\">How a two-man Vancouver team created Apple&#039;s 2017 game of the year</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/technology/gaming/nintendo-labo-combines-switch-games-with-interactive-cardboard-toys\">Nintendo Labo is a new series of Switch games with cardboard toys</a></li></ul>\n<p>As time went on, the game&#8217;s popularity continued to amaze its makers. Snowman still receives fan art from devoted players as well as stirring messages about how the game&#8217;s relaxing nature has helped people coping with stress or illness.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It really drove home that for a lot of our fans, <em>Alto\u2019s Adventure</em> was more than just a game to&nbsp;play, it was also a place they could go for a little time each day,&#8221; says Cash.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal !msorm;\">If you haven&#8217;t played, <em>Alto&#8217;s Adventure</em></span> is an model of minimalism.

And millions of people have found the experience gloriously gratifying.</p>\n<p>Cash says the Spartan design choices were deliberate. &#8220;It&#8217;s about capturing the feeling of being alone on a mountain, just you and nature,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;That moment when everything else falls away, and&nbsp;you\u2019re at peace with your thoughts.&nbsp;And like with a trip into nature \u2013 a hike, for example \u2013 you get to decide how long you want to spend there, and what you&nbsp;want to see.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And now, two years later, Cash and his slightly expanded team \u2013 still lead by principal designer and programmer Harry Nesbitt \u2013 are trying to see if they can&#8217;t get lightning to strike a second time as they prepare to launch <em>Alto&#8217;s Odyssey</em>, which is set to hit the App Store February 22.</p>\n<p>Less a sequel and more &#8220;a new experience in the same world,&#8221; according to Cash, the follow-up maintains the original&#8217;s uncluttered look and feel as well as its intuitive mechanics and objectives. Players will find themselves boarding down sandy dunes and leaping over rocky canyons, but they&#8217;ll still feel that Zen-like vibe of being alone in nature.</p>\n<p>&#8220;From my personal perspective, I had always wanted <em>Alto\u2019s Adventure</em> to be the beginning of a story for our cast of characters that we could tell over many years,&#8221; says Cash, adding that his team drew from events that had taken place in their lives, including moving to new homes and personal upheaval.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"1540841\" data-permalink=\"http://business.financialpost.com/technology/gaming/built-by-snowman-is-making-all-the-right-moves-for-its-altos-adventure-sequel/attachment/ao1\" data-orig-file=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/ao1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"960,540\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"AO1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/ao1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/ao1.jpg?w=640\" class=\"alignright size-large wp-image-1540841\" src=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/ao1.jpg?w=640&#038;h=360\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/ao1.jpg?w=640&amp;h=360 640w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/ao1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/ao1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/ao1.jpg?w=768&amp;h=432 768w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/ao1.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"></p>\n<p>&#8220;Once we set down to playing around in this space we spent a month or so in what we called an &#8216;Alto Jam,&#8217; experimenting with new mechanics and features. Many ended&nbsp;up on the cutting room floor, but we were drawn to those which reinforced this sense of exploration, like the ability to ride rock walls, multiple natural biomes to discover, and&nbsp;brand new wildlife to interact with.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It has everything that made the first game so habit forming, and more. Still, in the deeply competitive world mobile games, success is far from assured. Two years is a long time between games, and crafty rivals have used that time to step in and piggyback on Snowman&#8217;s success. You don&#8217;t have to look far for so-called &#8220;clones&#8221; of the studio&#8217;s previous work. Search &#8220;Alto&#8221; in the App Store and a blatant rip-off is the second result returned.</p>\n<p>Cash is well aware of these dubious duplicates, but his reaction is measured.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On one hand, there&#8217;s that old chestnut that &#8216;copying is the sincerest form of flattery,'&#8221; he muses. &#8220;There\u2019s an odd sense of pride in seeing games that&nbsp;are obvious clones of <span style=\"font-style:normal !msorm;\"><em>Alto\u2019s Adventure</em></span>, as it feels in a sense like we\u2019re seen as a game worth copying.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;On the other hand,&#8221; he continues, &#8220;cloned games are almost always free, and almost always mislead people that are looking for the title they\u2019re replicating.&nbsp;As a team that cares deeply about crafting artful experiences that bring people joy, it\u2019s one of the worst things we can imagine to consider that clones of our game might&nbsp;confuse players and \u2013 even if just in some small part \u2013 taint their view of the series or the Alto name.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Long story short, Cash isn&#8217;t assuming that Alto&#8217;s follow-up will automatically be a success. He knows that while delivering a fun and polished product is vital, it&#8217;s just half the battle. The other half is being your own game&#8217;s biggest advocate by working hard to get word out to potential players.</p>\n<p>To that end, he&#8217;s taking full advantage of Apple&#8217;s recently unveiled pre-order feature, which allows users to set their accounts to automatically purchase and download games in which they&#8217;re interested the moment they come available.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We really think of pre-order as another chance to connect with fans who are excited about the game,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;We\u2019ve always thought very&nbsp;carefully about marketing and telling the Alto story, whether that be through our social media tone and voice, or the trailers we launch to reveal the game.&nbsp;We\u2019re optimistic that pairing a pre-order with our big release date announcement will make the experience of finding out about <em>Alto\u2019s Odyssey</em> more exciting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Given his company&#8217;s past success, other mobile developers could do worse than follow Cash&#8217;s lead when it comes to marketing strategy. His secret, he says, is simple: To be as dedicated to telling people about the things you make as you are to&nbsp;making them. That might not come naturally to small teams focused on coding and art, but Cash believes it&#8217;s an essential part of finding an audience.</p>\n<p>&#8220;From the day you start working on your project you need be thinking about how you\u2019re going to&nbsp;ensure that press, fans, and prospective players know exactly why your game is special. Today, it isn\u2019t enough to just make something fun.&#8221;</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://business.financialpost.com/technology/gaming/built-by-snowman-is-making-all-the-right-moves-for-its-altos-adventure-sequel/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<postmedia:alexa><![CDATA[Built By Snowman is making all the right moves for its Alto's Adventure sequel.

Despite selling out inventory, Rodriguez says she struggled to find a bank that would extend her a small-business loan. She chalked it up to finance-industry jitters when it comes to sex.</p>\n<p>Now she sees a ray of hope coming from digital currency.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When you get labelled as an adult company, you get blacklisted, effectively,&#8221; Rodriguez says. &#8220;The moment you put it into code and take out the subjective moral judgment, it&#8217;s a shift.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Banks and credit-card companies can be hidebound when it comes to adult businesses, which can be big moneymakers. Sex toys alone haul in more than US$20 billion a year around the world, and by 2020, sales are expected to reach almost US$30 billion, according to London-based market-research firm Technavio. Still, financial firms consider sex-toy sellers high risk, lumping them in with businesses such as escort services and pornography websites, which can sometimes flirt with illegality.</p>\n<p>Credit-card companies are also wary of chargebacks, which happen when a cardholder claims a transaction is fraudulent. For instance, a man charges his porn-watching to his card, then denies he was doing it when his wife discovers the payment, leaving the card company to eat the money.</p>\n<p>Freedom from such complications has some adult companies cheering the swell of digital currencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the rise of digital-payment tokens, which could help them skirt skeptical intermediaries and allow customers to make direct payments.</p>\n<ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/technology/blockchain/massive-cryptocurrency-heist-spurs-calls-for-more-regulation-3\">Massive cryptocurrency heist spurs calls for more regulation</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/technology/blockchain/bitcoin-mania-exposes-troubling-vulnerabilities-in-crytpocurrency-exchanges\">Bitcoin mania exposes troubling vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency exchanges</a></li></ul>\n<p>Xavi Clos, head of production at BaDoink VR, a virtual-reality porn-production company, said that tokens show big potential in the adult industry because they&#8217;re anonymous and direct ways to accept payment. The problem, he says, is &#8220;for actual commercial use, there&#8217;s nothing that&#8217;s ready for prime time yet.&#8221; Transaction costs are still too high, and the infrastructure, subject to hacks and freezes, must improve first.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not for a lack of trying. A cottage industry of digital-payment mechanisms for sex-focused businesses is emerging. One early entrant, SpankChain, is setting up a payment ecosystem based on the Ethereum blockchain. In a white paper, authored by &#8220;Spanktoshi Nakabooty&#8221; \u2014 a reference to Bitcoin&#8217;s anonymous creator with the nom de guerre Satoshi Nakamoto \u2014 SpankChain explains how the tokens can be used as payment tools for webcams. The virtual payment arrangement will differentiate itself by charging a five per cent fee on performer earnings, compared with the 30 per cent to 50 per cent charged by traditional cam services, according to the Nakabooty white paper.</p>\n<p>Such tokens would revolutionize webcams, which allow performers to stream live shows while users reward them with virtual tips. Payment-processing costs currently chew up a lot of their earnings. This year, CEO Ameen Soleimani said SpankChain would promote its own webcam site as a demonstration project. Porn actress Giselle Palmer starred in its first live-cam show on New Year&#8217;s Day.</p>\n\n<p>Another coin for the adult-entertainment industry, called Intimate, aims to cater to webcam businesses but also extend to businesses including sex-toy retailers, short-stay hotels and escort services in countries where they&#8217;re legal.</p>\n<p>Intimate founder Reuben Coppa spread the word about Intimate&#8217;s initial coin offering at a cryptocurrency conference in New York in November. Coppa wore a T-shirt bearing the company&#8217;s logo, which resembles a stylized thong.</p>\n<p>Coppa, an Australian who speaks a mile a minute, zigzagged from talk of the ICO to other projects that will go with the payment mechanism. The company is developing something called Intimate Reputation, a blockchain-enabled rating system that allows escorts to know more about their customers before meeting them in person.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Right now, what they rely on is phone calls and the tone of text messages&#8221; to determine whether an interaction with a client will be safe, Coppa says. &#8220;By applying something like an Uber or Airbnb rating, they could make behaviour better.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Companies like SpankChain and Intimate face an uphill climb with regulators already leery of ICOs. The Securities and Exchange Commission warned investors last year that they are likely hotbeds of fraud and created a cyber division that will focus in part on violations. The unit comes as ICOs raked in more than US$2 billion in capital last year, according to analysts at Autonomous Research in New York. Companies are also betting that users will eventually get comfortable paying with virtual currency, which is far from certain.</p>\n<p>The marriage between the sex business and crypto-payments would be impossible without the squeamishness of traditional bankers. The banks&#8217; opposition could change once they see how much money they stand to lose to virtual-currency companies, says sex-toy seller Rodriguez.</p>\n<p>If cryptocurrencies and digital tokens come into widespread use in the adult industry, she says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have to spend so much time worrying &#8216;Is my bank account going to get shut down?&#8217; Because we&#8217;re so unwilling to have conversations about sexual health and wellness in a way that&#8217;s healthy and good, we end up relegating this industry to the shadows. And that&#8217;s not good for anybody.&#8221;</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://business.financialpost.com/technology/blockchain/sex-businesses-are-finding-willing-partners-in-cryptocurrencies/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<postmedia:alexa><![CDATA[Where banks balk, sex businesses find willing partners in cryptocurrencies.
