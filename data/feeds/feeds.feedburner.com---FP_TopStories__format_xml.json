Expansion will also be helped by the extent to which its investors \u2014 either institutional or high-net-worth individuals \u2014 are attracted to the growing private-debt asset class. (Entities including Bridging Finance and Third Eye Capital also operate in this sector.)</p>\n<p>As a manager, Kilgour Williams sits in an enviable position. Thanks to relationships it has established with its three U.S. platforms \u2014 Lending Club, Prosper and Biz2Credit \u2014 it is not required to source or originate the loans. Instead, it selects from what it is offered with the goal being to create a diversified portfolio of loans that it owns.</p>\n<p>Nor is it involved in administering the loans. \u201cOur strength is portfolio management, credit management and fund management,\u201d&nbsp;Kilgour said, as opposed to the sourcing, underwriting, selling and servicing loan skills of the fintech companies.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe get paid for managing the credit risk,\u201d he said, noting the portfolio of amortizing loans spins off cash on a regular basis, which must be reinvested. Those cash flows are boosted because the borrower can often prepay the loan without penalty.</p>\n<p>This week, Kilgour Williams issued its January 2018 report that shows the fund has now fully deployed the $30 million provided by the original backers. To invest that $30 million takes a lot of work, given that the fund\u2019s average loan is US$12,254. Of its 2,000 loans, 90 per cent are consumer loans with small business loans making up nine per cent. (Cash accounts for the other one per cent.) From a yield perspective, the original loans are attractive as they come with an average interest rate of 17.02 per cent. Of the loans, 95.8 per cent are current; four per cent are late and a mere 0.2 per cent are in default.</p>\n<p>The January numbers are similar to December&#8217;s. Then the average interest and the average loan provided were a tad smaller at 15.75 per cent and US$12,026, respectively.</p>\n<p>For those who provided the original $30 million investment, the news is also good. For January, the distribution was 0.7 per cent, or 8.40 per cent on an annual basis \u2014 in line with the target rate of return. At 0.7 per cent the distribution is the highest so far.</p>\n<p>\u201cOver the past six weeks there has been considerable volatility in equities and bond markets,\u201d said Kilgour, noting that inflation fears have led to a selloff in fixed income markets. \u201cBut in the private-credit world, we have a stable net asset value and we are splitting our income.\u201d</p>\n<p>If rates rise, Kilgour argues the portfolio\u2019s short duration (the relationship between price and a change in interest rates) will provide some protection. \u201cWe will be reinvesting principal at the higher rates,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p><em>Financial Post</em></p>\n<p><em>bcritchley@postmedia.com</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=Lhd_mlaovUo:MjoW7bo9gzA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=Lhd_mlaovUo:MjoW7bo9gzA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?i=Lhd_mlaovUo:MjoW7bo9gzA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=Lhd_mlaovUo:MjoW7bo9gzA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?i=Lhd_mlaovUo:MjoW7bo9gzA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=Lhd_mlaovUo:MjoW7bo9gzA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=Lhd_mlaovUo:MjoW7bo9gzA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?i=Lhd_mlaovUo:MjoW7bo9gzA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FP_TopStories/~4/Lhd_mlaovUo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/kiwis-marketplace-loans-set-for-imminent-canadian-debut/feed</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t<postmedia:alexa><![CDATA[KiWi's marketplace loans set for imminent Canadian debut.

Ltd. (CCCC) \u2014 a deal that has been sharply opposed by domestic construction companies and some members of Parliament, and is now under national security review.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-who-needs-fake-news-when-the-regular-media-is-already-so-irritating\">Terence Corcoran: Who needs fake news when the regular media is already so irritating?</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/investing/aecon-a-stepping-stone-for-beijing-fears-rise-as-ottawa-decides-on-1-5b-deal\">Aecon a &#039;stepping stone&#039; for Beijing: Fears rise as Ottawa decides on $1.5-billion deal</a></li></ul>\n<p>According to the federal lobbyist registry, Beattie was registered to lobby government officials, including the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and the Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada office that is overseeing a review of the acquisition. A lobbyist confirmed to the Financial Post Beattie did not meet with PMO officials, but did meet with officials at Investment Canada. Beattie was also quoted in a media report condemning the deal.</p>\n<p>His meetings were part of a broader lobbying effort in Ottawa after the deal was announced in October, in which lobbyists circulated documents to media detailing some of the ethically dubious or even unlawful activities committed by CCCC, in other countries. Beattie joined other critics in urging Ottawa to review the proposed deal.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I don\u2019t like is the negative campaign that\u2019s been run by people of questionable repute and their representatives,\u201d Beck said. \u201cI think it\u2019s distorting and corrupting the process.\u201d</p>\n<p>Despite claims of being a &#8220;highly regarded&#8221; and successful businessman, Beattie\u2019s name is not known in either construction or financial circles, according to representatives at Aecon and one financial industry insider.</p>\n<p>One source familiar with the matter said Beattie did not approach the financial advisers, BMO Capital Markets and TD Securities, after he issued the initial press release. Nor did he request access from Aecon to the confidential corporate information that buyers typically demand.</p>\n\n<p>Beattie engaged&nbsp;Ottawa-based lobby firms Ensign Canada and Navigator Ltd., and a financing company named Novatrek Capital GmbH based in Switzerland, to represent him in late January and early February in talks with various government officials. The two Ottawa firms have since unregistered with him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Days after those meetings took place, Aecon issued a press release disputing Beattie&#8217;s comments, saying the company was \u201cunable to find any evidence that Mr. Beattie is a \u2018veteran construction industry executive.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Beattie&#8217;s company MBM Consulting and Construction Corp., which he claims to have established in 1995 according to an online bio, and subsidiaries MBM Consulting and MBM Investment Corp., do not appear to be registered, according to searches by the Financial Post. Beattie declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Beck said efforts to block the deal are largely misguided, arguing that Canada&#8217;s construction industry has already been heavily invested in by massive European and U.S. construction firms. The U.S.&#8217;s Bechtel Corp., Spain&#8217;s Grupo ACS and South Korea&#8217;s Samsung are just a few conglomerates that have outbid Canadian rivals in recent years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what the campaign is about \u2014 it\u2019s mostly been a misrepresentation of the facts,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Beattie met with officials at Investment Canada and two conservative members of Parliament, Tony Clement and Erin O\u2019Toole, both of whom oppose the deal.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt the core, he had the same concerns,\u201d O\u2019Toole said of his Jan. 31 meeting with Beattie. \u201cHe was also really trying to establish his bona fides, which was very unusual. He would talk about his family\u2019s long history in the industry and things like that \u2014 it was very Canadiana focused.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Clement, for his part, said \u201cit was a courtesy meeting,\u201d and that he had \u201cmade up (his) mind about the Aecon transaction weeks before\u201d he had met Beattie.</p>\n<p>Beck said that efforts to block CCCC\u2019s purchase of Aecon distract from the fact that Canada\u2019s construction industry is increasingly in need of international backing as the market becomes more global.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo be able to compete and to survive on our own soil, we need to find some way to find financial support and backing,\u201d Beck said. \u201cWe went through a very careful and very diligent sales process, and searched for buyers around the world, and the Chinese were particularly interested.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe industry over the past five to 10 years has been increasingly populated by large international companies, because our governments \u2014 both provincial and federal \u2014 have gone out of their way to attract them to come to Canada,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Even so, many experts argue that Chinese foreign direct investment deserves a unique level of scrutiny. Allegations have emerged in recent years in Australia, Britain, the United States and elsewhere of increased attempts by the Chinese to influence local policy decisions, often by bribing officials. Experts say these efforts are often channeled through state-run enterprises, which act as an arm of the government.</p>\n<p>Both the Conservative opposition and the NDP in Ottawa had called for a national security review on the deal. Some, including Conservative MP Maxime Bernier, alleged that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#8217;s ambition to sign a trade deal with China could cloud the final decision.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Beck said the role of what his company actually does on site, including at nuclear facilities or on telecommunications infrastructure, has been misrepresented by opponents.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re a construction company. We install things, we cut and weld things, we have no intellectual property, we have no secret information,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have no sensitive activities.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u2022 Email: <a href=\"mailto:jsnyder@nationalpost.com\">jsnyder@nationalpost.com</a> | Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jesse_snyder\" class=\"twitter-follow-button\">jesse_snyder</a></em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=iT1MyIBOAyg:s4YvTVJtApU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=iT1MyIBOAyg:s4YvTVJtApU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?i=iT1MyIBOAyg:s4YvTVJtApU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=iT1MyIBOAyg:s4YvTVJtApU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?i=iT1MyIBOAyg:s4YvTVJtApU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=iT1MyIBOAyg:s4YvTVJtApU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=iT1MyIBOAyg:s4YvTVJtApU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?i=iT1MyIBOAyg:s4YvTVJtApU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FP_TopStories/~4/iT1MyIBOAyg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://business.financialpost.com/news/aecon-ceo-accuses-critic-of-1-5b-deal-to-buy-his-company-of-corrupting-the-process/feed</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t<postmedia:alexa><![CDATA[Aecon CEO accuses vocal critic of $1.5-billion deal to buy his company of 'corrupting the process'.

He said they discussed the impact of U.S. tax changes, as well as ongoing talks to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement.

In a letter to Morneau this week, the Business Council of Canada &#8212; which represents chief executives from dozens of major companies &#8212; said the country &#8220;must move quickly to shore up its business tax competitiveness.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Morneau said this year&#8217;s budget would build off the last two, at a time when a slowing economy is leaving him with little room for new spending. Canada led the Group of Seven in economic growth in 2017 but is poised to fall to third-place, behind the U.S. and Germany, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We urge you to take decisive action now to bolster private-sector confidence in the Canadian economy, discourage capital flight and increase the incentives for new business investment,&#8221; business council President John Manley said in his letter to Morneau, dated Tuesday. Manley, himself a former finance minister, suggested an immediate cut to corporate taxes as one option.</p>\n<p>Morneau said Friday that in the short-term the budget will be about &#8220;making sure everyone can be successful in our economy&#8221; so that in the longer term, it can be innovative and create jobs for more Canadians. &#8220;We know that women can have a higher participation rate in our workforce, we know that they&#8217;re not getting the same returns from their work. But we also know that over the long-term we need to focus on research and science.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The private-sector economists had a diversity of views, Morneau said, but many argued Canada&#8217;s economy is in a position to weather challenges.&nbsp;&#8220;The best way we can think about uncertainties and risks is by having a strong and resilient economy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Morneau reiterated his commitment to reducing Canada&#8217;s debt relative to the size of its gross domestic product but declined to say whether he&#8217;ll balance the budget.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com\"><em>Bloomberg.com</em></a></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=EEF8BZvxIPk:BxtsFGeg0wk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=EEF8BZvxIPk:BxtsFGeg0wk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?i=EEF8BZvxIPk:BxtsFGeg0wk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=EEF8BZvxIPk:BxtsFGeg0wk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?i=EEF8BZvxIPk:BxtsFGeg0wk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=EEF8BZvxIPk:BxtsFGeg0wk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=EEF8BZvxIPk:BxtsFGeg0wk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?i=EEF8BZvxIPk:BxtsFGeg0wk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FP_TopStories/~4/EEF8BZvxIPk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadas-corporate-tax-rates-remain-competitive-in-spite-of-u-s-cuts-morneau-says/feed</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t<postmedia:alexa><![CDATA[Canada's corporate tax rates remain competitive in spite of U.S. cuts, Morneau says.

In Hangzhou, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. thanked Trudeau for coming by creating a <a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/chinese-e-commerce-giant-alibaba-courts-canadian-sellers-to-its-platform\">\u201cpavilion\u201d for Canadian merchants on its digital marketplace</a>. San Francisco\u2019s Salesforce <a href=\"https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/salesforce-to-invest-2-billion-in-its-canadian-business-over-five-years-673375623.html\">said</a> during Trudeau\u2019s swing through Northern California that it would invest more than $2 billion in Canada over the next five years.</p>\n<p>Next up for Canada\u2019s prime minister: India, where he begins a week-long trip on Sunday. But if any of Bengaluru\u2019s tech billionaires want the Alibaba treatment, they are going to have to seek out Trudeau on their own time and dime. The plan is to stop in five cities, but India\u2019s tech capital isn\u2019t one of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing as much as we can,\u201d someone from the Prime Minister\u2019s Office told reporters who had gathered to hear about the trip.</p>\n<p>To be fair, India is a trickier place for Trudeau to go than, say, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who can visit the Asian subcontinent without having to worry about domestic political considerations.</p>\n<p>Trudeau, however, has to think about expectations back home.</p>\n<p>You might have heard the prime minister <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/i-have-more-sikhs-in-cabinet-than-modi-canadian-pm/article8348687.ece\">boast that he has more Sikhs in his cabinet than his Indian counterpart</a>, Narendra Modi. That\u2019s a great expression of diversity, but it necessitates a stop in Punjab, the northwestern state that is both the spiritual home of Sikhs and the majority of Canada\u2019s Indian diaspora.</p>\n<p>Trudeau also will visit Gujarat, home state of both Modi and another large Indo-Canadian voting bloc. When a Canadian politician visits India, he or she is also campaigning. The denizens of Bengaluru might have money to invest, but Punjabis and Gujaratis deliver votes. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Chatter about politics will intrude on Trudeau\u2019s stay in India because the trailing press will struggle to find enough hard news to keep it busy.</p>\n<p>India, which has taken over from China as the fastest growing major economy, is an important target as Canada attempts to diversify its commercial partners. And while there is lots of potential, Canada\u2019s relationship with India remains a work in progress.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://pm.gc.ca/eng/minister-international-trade-mandate-letter\">the mandate letter Trudeau wrote for his trade minister</a>, India was one of only two countries mentioned by name. (China was the other.) This is Trudeau\u2019s first trip, but there have been eleven ministerial visits during his watch, a sharp increase from the Harper years.</p>\n<p>Desire only takes you so far. <a href=\"http://international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/india-inde/fta-ale/background-contexte.aspx?lang=eng\">The proposed Canada-India Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement remains stuck</a>, even though negotiators have been working on it since 2010. Talks over an investment-protection treaty have been deadlocked for even longer.</p>\n<p>Modi is a little like U.S. President Donald Trump in that <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/globalisation-is-losing-its-lustre-modi-tells-davos-summit/story-6wKXORU466klft7HEATY0J.html\">when he says India is open for business</a>, he means he\u2019d like you to come and spend money in his country. <a href=\"http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/TjhwiyIuWRAjVma8IsneKI/Indias-protectionist-folly.html\">He is less keen about buying anything that he thinks could be made in India</a>. His government\u2019s latest budget raised import tariffs on smartphones and other electronics, for example. That won\u2019t hurt Canada much, but the new duties reflect a larger protectionist impulse among India\u2019s politicians and bureaucrats.</p>\n<p>Canada\u2019s exporters of lentils and peas know what I\u2019m talking about.</p>\n<p>They have done incredibly well in South Asia in recent years. <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/executive-insight/canada-taking-slow-boat-on-trade-with-fast-growing-india/article21790032/\">When I met former Saskatchewan premier Brad Wall in Mumbai in 2014</a>, he boasted that his province was responsible for about half of Canada\u2019s merchandise exports to India. That\u2019s because Saskatchewan is an excellent place to grow lentils and chickpeas, staples of the Indian diet, and because it is home to one of the world\u2019s big producers of fertilizer. A population of more than 1 billion people needs a lot of food.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1544925\" style=\"max-width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/0216pulses.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1544925\" data-permalink=\"http://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/as-trudeau-heads-to-india-theres-much-more-than-a-few-photo-ops-at-stake/attachment/0216pulses\" data-orig-file=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/0216pulses.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1000,750\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He probably won\u2019t manage that, as Indian agriculture is famously inefficient, but that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t try. At the end of last year, India issued <a href=\"https://www.producer.com/2017/11/surprise-indian-duty-on-peas-leaves-canada-scrambling/\">a surprise 50-per-cent tax on pea imports to offset a price drop that was hurting local farmers</a>. That was only the latest example of trade harassment, and suddenly pulses don\u2019t look like such a great bet. Canadian farmers say they will cut their lentil acreage by about 30 per cent this year, and pea plants look set to drop to a seven-year low, <a href=\"//business.financialpost.com/commodities/agriculture/pea-boom-goes-bust-as-canada-farmers-ditch-pulses-for-canola\">Bloomberg News reported this week</a>, citing federal survey data. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is why Bengaluru matters. If Canada is going to build a vibrant commercial relationship with India, it must move beyond protein and fossil fuels to include an emphasis on innovation and technology.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to build a brain chain,\u201d Kasi Rao, president of the Canada-Indian Business Council, said.</p>\n<p>India\u2019s gross domestic product will increase by the equivalent of about $2 billion over the next five years, while the population expands to 1.4 billion from 1.3 billion currently, according to forecast by the International Monetary Fund. A country that big, and growing that fast, will require lots of resources and Canada is among a small group of countries well placed to supply them.</p>\n<p>But India and Canada are also well placed to help each other\u2019s tech industries battle the giants of Silicon Valley and China.</p>\n<p>Take SOTI Inc., a Mississauga, Ont.-based maker of mobile software.</p>\n<p>The company is growing faster than Canada can support. Founder and chief executive Carl Rodrigues couldn\u2019t find enough software engineers to keep up with surging orders. So he had a choice: settle for running a smaller company, or go find the talent he needed.</p>\n<p>A couple of years ago, he set up an office in Gurgaon, officially Gurugram, a suburb of New Delhi. SOTI now employs about 200 people in the sort of fancy workspace-cum-playpen that is the norm in the tech business. \u201cThat is what you have to do to attract people,\u201d even in India, Rodrigues said of his investment in interior design. \u201cWe have to find places where we can find the people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another example of Rao\u2019s \u201cbrain chain\u201d would be the startup incubator that Ryerson University runs in Mumbai with the Bombay Stock Exchange.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1544928\" style=\"max-width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/0216rodrigues.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1544928\" data-permalink=\"http://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/as-trudeau-heads-to-india-theres-much-more-than-a-few-photo-ops-at-stake/attachment/0216rodrigues\" data-orig-file=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/0216rodrigues.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1000,750\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"0216rodrigues\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;SOTI founder and chief executive Carl Rodrigues. &lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/0216rodrigues.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/0216rodrigues.jpg?w=640\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1544928\" src=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/0216rodrigues.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/0216rodrigues.jpg?w=640&amp;h=480 640w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/0216rodrigues.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113 150w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/0216rodrigues.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225 300w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/0216rodrigues.jpg?w=768&amp;h=576 768w, http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/02/0216rodrigues.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">SOTI founder and chief executive Carl Rodrigues.</p></div>\n<p>But you shouldn\u2019t assume the investment would be one way. One97 Communications Ltd., an Indian fintech company valued at about US$10 billion, has a research centre in Toronto. The company\u2019s payments brand, Paytm, recently released its app in Canada, highlighting the country\u2019s potential as a staging ground for a bigger assault on the North American market.</p>\n<p>It all looks so perfect on paper that you\u2019d think David Ricardo had Canada and India in mind when he developed his theory of comparative advantage in the first part of the 1800\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Reality is much different. Canada does more trade with seven other countries than it does with India, which, when you consider the U.S. accounts for three-quarters of our international sales, means we effectively do nothing of significance with an economy that is growing around 7 per cent per year.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s because it is very difficult for outsiders to make money there.</p>\n<p>Business in India is conducted in person, and it takes more than half a day to get there from Toronto. The Indian market is huge, but it still is a very poor country, meaning a company has to sacrifice profit margins to be competitive there. And even though things are getting better, <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/10/31/india-jumps-doing-business-rankings-with-sustained-reform-focus\">India still sits in the bottom half of the World Bank\u2019s annual ease of doing business rankings</a>. For example, it takes 1,445 days to enforce a contract, longer than 15 years ago, according to the World Bank\u2019s calculations. Throw in some serious culture shock, and you can understand why so many Canadian executives gave up over the past few decades.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you walk into India and you think it\u2019s just like Canada, you are going to be in trouble,\u201d said Rodrigues, who was born in the southern Indian state of Goa and moved to Canada as a boy. \u201cWe found someone who knows the Indian market,\u201d he added. \u201cThis guy managed to make stuff happen in a faster way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Trudeau\u2019s trip, and the relentless stream of ministerial visits that he has ordered, also will make stuff happen in a faster way. Canadians tend to see trade missions as boondoggles, but they matter in Asia, where politicians retain significant sway over private business decisions.</p>\n<p>We might think it stupid and shallow, but those with whom we are trying to cut deals don\u2019t.

Overall, they are anticipating growth to slow down to the historically sluggish levels the economy has averaged in the post-recession era, after an unexpected pick up in 2017.</p>\n<p>That effectively gives Morneau no room to ramp up spending without running higher deficits or raising tax levels, and likely means any new initiatives will probably need to be financed by reallocating spending within the existing framework or possibly tapping into existing buffers built into the fiscal plan.</p>\n<ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canada-should-cut-corporate-tax-rate-and-incentivize-high-tech-investments-mintz\">Canada should cut corporate tax rate, incentivize high-tech investments in wake of U.S. tax reforms: Mintz</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/despite-trumps-proposed-budgetary-profligacy-theres-still-an-argument-for-fiscal-restraint\">Trump\u2019s extravagance all the more reason for Canada to tighten its belt</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/old-economy-pains-shackle-canadas-trudeau-in-silicon-valley\">Old economy pains holding back Trudeau&#039;s quest to remake Canada as a tech leader</a></li></ul>\n<p>Speaking after announcing the date earlier this week, Morneau said the budget would &#8220;continue to ensure that middle class Canadians are doing well&#8221; and include investments in research, science and skills training for what he called the &#8220;economy of tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Reducing Debt</h3>\n<p>Still, the Feb. 27 plan is likely only a placeholder for a more ambitious pre-election budget that should arrive at about this time next year. The constrained fiscal framework could pose a serious dilemma for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#8217;s government, which says it remains committed to at least reducing the nation&#8217;s debt as a share of gross domestic product.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to continue to show Canadians that we can make those investments while reducing the amount of debt as a function of our economy,&#8221; Morneau told reporters Tuesday outside the legislature in Ottawa. &#8220;That will continue to be our anchor.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s steady economic picture contrasts with a fiscal update in October when the government reported an unexpected windfall in revenue due to a stronger-than-expected economy. It used it to scale back deficit projections and finance new spending.</p>\n<p>In October, the Liberal government cut its deficit projection for the fiscal year that ends March 31 to $19.9 billion, down from $28.5 billion in the March budget. It also projected a cumulative deficit over the coming five fiscal years of $86.5 billion, compared with $120 billion previously.</p>\n<p>While the department doesn&#8217;t typically release the results of its survey of private sector economists, Bloomberg gathered forecasts independently from Canada&#8217;s six biggest banks. Here are some of the results:</p>\n<p>Economists are projecting nominal gross domestic product will average about $2.23 trillion between 2017 and 2019, almost exactly the same forecast as in October. Nominal GDP growth is forecast at 5.2 per cent in 2017, 4.1 per cent in 2018 and 3.6 per cent in 2019. Growth has averaged 3.8 per cent since 2010, well below the 7.4 per cent average over the past five decades. Unless the government changes its estimate for revenue as a share of nominal GDP \u2014 which was 14.5 per cent in October \u2014 that means the revenue picture will probably be little changed through 2019.</p>\n<p>The finance department holds as many as four economist surveys a year that in turn form the basis of its own forecasts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bloomberg.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=puVoixn7t9U:psKi_QuWHOQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=puVoixn7t9U:psKi_QuWHOQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?i=puVoixn7t9U:psKi_QuWHOQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=puVoixn7t9U:psKi_QuWHOQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?i=puVoixn7t9U:psKi_QuWHOQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=puVoixn7t9U:psKi_QuWHOQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=puVoixn7t9U:psKi_QuWHOQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?i=puVoixn7t9U:psKi_QuWHOQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FP_TopStories/~4/puVoixn7t9U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trudeaus-finance-chief-has-little-room-for-new-budget-measures/feed</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t<postmedia:alexa><![CDATA[Finance Minister Bill Morneau has little room for new budget spending.

As well, such a stock would attract the interest of short sellers.</p>\n<p>But there is at least one TSX stock that has consistently traded above its NAV and that shows no sign of returning to its proper value. That stock is Cymbria Corp., which also ranks as one of the TSX\u2019s more unusual companies. On Thursday, the shares closed at $52.75; on its website Cymbria listed the NAV at $45.57.</p>\n<p>Toronto-based Cymbria, which went public in 2008, is unusual because it offers its owners an interest in a portfolio of public securities as well as an interest in a money manager, EdgePoint Wealth Management. (A group of managers, all of whom worked together at Trimark, now known as Invesco, formed EdgePoint.)</p>\n<p>In its IPO, Cymbria raised $233.9 million, of which $142 million (at $10 a share) came from the public and the rest from a private placement. At the time, Cymbria had a 22 per cent stake in EdgePoint.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Manager believes the wealth management company has the potential to be a material contributor to the long-term value of the company, however, this investment will only require a minimal amount of capital as a proportion of the size of this offering,\u201d Cymbria said then. Cymbria\u2019s original EdgePoint investment was a tad over $500,000.</p>\n<p>Since then Cymbria hasn\u2019t been in the public markets raising additional capital, although on a regular basis it announces a normal course issuer bid. And it doesn\u2019t talk much: messages sent to two of its management team weren\u2019t returned.</p>\n<p>But EdgePoint, which now accounts for 15.48 per cent of its portfolio, has been the big winner.</p>\n<p>For instance, at the end of 2017, retail assets under management were about $15 billion while institutional assets were about $3.2 billion. Those assets come from a concentrated source of providers: at the retail level, 20 per cent of advisors represent about 83 per cent of the assets; at the institutional level, 20 per cent account for 93 per cent. \u201cWe look forward to building wealth for our investment partners over the long term,\u201d said Cymbria.</p>\n<p>Given the growth of EdgePoint\u2019s business, what is the stake worth? Last December, Cymbria determined it was worth $185.9 million. (It has also received a total of $33.5 million in dividends.)</p>\n<p>Given that Cymbria originally invested only $509,000, the returns have been rather spectacular. Cymbria said it determined that valuation \u201cwith the assistance of an independent valuator and the Valuation Committee.\u201d</p>\n<p>One year earlier, (December 2016) EdgePoint was valued at $110.3 million. At end of 2013, it was valued at $35.6 million. But over the years, Cymbria, according to its annual information form, has used a number of valuation approaches. While it&#8217;s now mainly a discounted cash flow model, \u201cas circumstances dictate, alternative valuation approaches to determine the fair value of EdgePoint may be utilized.\u201d</p>\n<p>For the period 2012 to 2014, the methodology was a combination based on metrics (a percentage of assets under management, or a multiple of EBITDA) as well as a DCF model.</p>\n<p>So what gives? It would seem investors are prepared to pay up based on the strength and quality of EdgePoint, which, could for example, realize full value by going public. In rough terms, Cymbria\u2019s 15.48 per cent stake accounts for about $7 of Cymbria\u2019s NAV and Cymbria trades around $7 above NAV. Accordingly, EdgePoint would have to double to bring NAV and trading price in line.</p>\n<p>Financial Post</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:bcritchley@postmedia.com\">bcritchley@postmedia.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=T--CpRfElII:2rg_OGjase8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=T--CpRfElII:2rg_OGjase8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?i=T--CpRfElII:2rg_OGjase8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=T--CpRfElII:2rg_OGjase8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?i=T--CpRfElII:2rg_OGjase8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=T--CpRfElII:2rg_OGjase8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=T--CpRfElII:2rg_OGjase8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?i=T--CpRfElII:2rg_OGjase8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FP_TopStories/~4/T--CpRfElII\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/why-does-cymbria-punch-above-its-net-asset-value/feed</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t<postmedia:alexa><![CDATA[Why does Cymbria punch above its net asset value?.

That brought the survey&#8217;s median estimate for the upper bound of the central bank&#8217;s federal funds rate target to 2.5 per cent by year-end. It is currently at 1.5 per cent.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Stronger growth and higher inflation would increase the odds of four Fed rate hikes in 2018,&#8221; Daco said in his survey comments. He added that the recent market strains won&#8217;t prevent a rate increase at the central bank&#8217;s next policy-making meeting on March 20-21.</p>\n<p>In their last quarterly projection in December, Fed officials penciled in three rate hikes for this year, according to the median forecast in their so-called dot plot. They tacitly reiterated that view at their Jan. 30-31 meeting, when they said they expected &#8220;further gradual increases in the federal funds rate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Economists are getting more upbeat about economic growth this year and next, according to the survey. They see gross domestic product expanding 2.9 per cent in 2018 and 2.5 per cent next year. GDP has averaged a 2.2 per cent advance since the expansion began in mid-2009.</p>\n<p>Inflation forecasts also edged up in the poll. Economists expect a price gauge tied to consumer spending and closely watched by the Fed to rise&nbsp;2 per cent in 2018 from a year earlier. That would meet the central bank&#8217;s goal. The year-over-year gain in the personal consumption expenditures price index was 1.7 per cent in December, the latest available data shows.</p>\n<p>The US$300 billion package passed last week comes on top of a US$1.5 trillion, 10-year tax cut that President Donald Trump signed into law in December. Trump this week also called for increased spending on roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Too much of a good thing is too much,&#8221; Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors Inc., said in his survey response. &#8220;The tax cuts, spending increases and potentially infrastructure package are likely to accelerate inflation and cause the Fed to raise rates higher and faster than expected.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/canada\"> Bloomberg</a></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=rHtemuyKR0Y:pnQcL9u2Gyc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=rHtemuyKR0Y:pnQcL9u2Gyc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?i=rHtemuyKR0Y:pnQcL9u2Gyc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=rHtemuyKR0Y:pnQcL9u2Gyc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?i=rHtemuyKR0Y:pnQcL9u2Gyc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=rHtemuyKR0Y:pnQcL9u2Gyc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?a=rHtemuyKR0Y:pnQcL9u2Gyc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FP_TopStories?i=rHtemuyKR0Y:pnQcL9u2Gyc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FP_TopStories/~4/rHtemuyKR0Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/fed-seen-stepping-up-pace-of-rate-hikes-bloomberg-survey-shows/feed</wfw:commentRss>\r\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\r\n\t<postmedia:alexa><![CDATA[Fed seen stepping up pace of rate hikes, Bloomberg survey shows.

Brookfield,&nbsp;which has $285 billion under management, said it has more than $25 billion in core liquidity and dry powder in its private funds.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We see no signs of underlying economic issues, despite the U.S. economy being nine years into this expansion,&#8221; Bruce Flatt, Brookfield chief executive officer, said in a letter to shareholders. &#8220;While this economic cycle shows no immediate signs of ending, it is clearly in its mid- to later-stages of an elongated expansion, and so we are being cautious, preparing for less robust times.&#8221;</p>\n<ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/property-post/brookfield-is-said-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-forest-city-realty-1\">Brookfield said to be in talks to buy Forest City Realty</a></li><li><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/commodities/brookfield-enters-the-nuclear-energy-business-with-4-6b-acquisition-of-troubled-westinghouse-electric-co\">Brookfield enters the nuclear energy business with $4.6B acquisition of troubled Westinghouse Electric Co.</a></li></ul>\n<p>He said there was cause for caution with equity markets hitting record highs, government bonds historically expensive, corporate and high-yield spreads at record lows, and &#8220;bitcoin mania&#8221; taking hold, creating a market capitalization of US$500 billion with &#8220;as far as we can tell, zero intrinsic value.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;An Italian renaissance painting was recently purchased for over US$500 million, an all-time high for the sale of a painting,&#8221; he said. &#8220;These all make us cautious, while still continuing to invest our capital.&#8221;</p>\n<h3><strong>Liquidity Focus</strong></h3>\n<p>Flatt said the firm is selling down mature assets and redeploying the proceeds to higher yielding investments. Outside of the U.S., economies are recovering and in general continue to offer greater value than is available in the U.S. Brexit, for example, is offering select opportunities for investment in the U.K., Europe more broadly is looking strong, as is Brazil, Australia, China and India, he said.</p>\n<p>Brookfield&#8217;s size, global reach, and operating capabilities has allowed it to jump on opportunities like acquiring TerraForm Power Inc. and TerraForm Global Inc. from the bankrupt SunEdison Inc. last year.
