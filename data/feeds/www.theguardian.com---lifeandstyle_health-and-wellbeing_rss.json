My rubric\u2019s always been to walk from home \u2013 I\u2019m not a rambler. It\u2019s about a sense of being and place and engagement with the environment around me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like wild swimming, particularly in the sea \u2013 I swim out, then float and look at the horizon. I think that\u2019s extremely good for the imagination. I still cycle even though I was knocked off my bike a few years ago, but mostly in the summer \u2013 it\u2019s too dangerous in the winter in London.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/18/will-self-im-fitter-than-ive-ever-been-walking\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing\">Health &amp; wellbeing</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/health\">Health</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/society\">Society</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 06:00:36 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/18/will-self-im-fitter-than-ive-ever-been-walking</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41104aa7f47cd962075e6a888671c836e427daf6/224_253_5194_3116/master/5194.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=76d672baf1b38152adbfdef76680bcaa\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: REX</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41104aa7f47cd962075e6a888671c836e427daf6/224_253_5194_3116/master/5194.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=9491fad4a303caff901157eb56fa19c4\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: REX</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Interview by Chris Hall</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2018-02-18T06:00:36Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>Are you eager to please?

Now aged 60, she recalls how she survived her her horrifying upbringing and began to lead a happy and well-balanced life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1936, a 34-year-old French businessman called Louis Didier struck a bargain with a poor mining couple in Lille: he persuaded them to give him their six-year-old daughter, Jeannine. Didier would provide the girl with material security and a university-level education and in return, her parents would never see her again. For Didier the handover was a day of grave significance, the first big step towards realising his life\u2019s ambition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His plan was to use Jeannine to give him a child that he would then sculpt into what he envisaged would be a superhuman. The child would be raised to be able to survive concentration camps and withstand torture under interrogation. Didier\u2019s confused and hostile worldview took shape during the years between the First and Second World Wars and he was convinced that, if properly physically, mentally and emotionally trained from birth, it would be possible for a person to transcend normal human reality. He embarked on his project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/18/maude-julien-how-i-escaped-from-my-fathers-cult\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/psychology\">Psychology</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/science\">Science</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing\">Health &amp; wellbeing</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/family\">Family</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting\">Parents and parenting</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/childprotection\">Child protection</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/child-rights\">Child rights</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/children\">Children</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/social-care\">Social care</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/society\">Society</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 06:00:36 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/18/maude-julien-how-i-escaped-from-my-fathers-cult</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d187b917e36d6c37a166c8aaa5435f3f2077c43e/0_116_3369_2023/master/3369.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=ae9098a7b3abe8e536e62e7e33e87b30\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Illustration: Andrea De Santis</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d187b917e36d6c37a166c8aaa5435f3f2077c43e/0_116_3369_2023/master/3369.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=19cd7b6fd3533bad754fdec2f69f6fd4\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Illustration: Andrea De Santis</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Stefanie Marsh</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2018-02-18T06:00:36Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>Every time I visit my family, they body-shame me</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/17/every-time-i-visit-my-family-they-body-shame-me</link>\r\n      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been through something similar, says Annalisa Barbieri.

Listening to music? Yes. Taking the dog? No&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have reached the end of week four of &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2017/apr/03/getting-fitter-20-million-exercise-early-death\"&gt;the NHS\u2019s Couch to 5K programme&lt;/a&gt;, although in real&amp;nbsp;time this is week eight. It is like Clive James\u2019s memoir &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/apr/03/featuresreviews.guardianreview20\"&gt;May Week Was In June&lt;/a&gt;, except I&amp;nbsp;wasn\u2019t discovering myself, I was just lazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I do have some observations, the first being that this programme is excellent: unlike almost all other advice I have seen on an NHS website, from eating five a day to going directly to A&amp;amp;E, it seems grounded in expertise&amp;nbsp;\u2013 and it works. I am making progress, though the idea that I would happily run upstairs remains tragically metaphorical. It started with running and walking in 60- and 90-second intervals, and now I can run for five minutes without wanting to die (with a walk&amp;nbsp;of two and a half minutes after each stint). But I have yet to find real enthusiasm for it and I have never come close to a runner\u2019s high, where you are so alive with endorphins (according to rumour) that you feel as though you can go for ever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/17/fit-in-my-40s-running-zoe-williams\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/running\">Running</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing\">Health &amp; wellbeing</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport\">Sport</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/fitness\">Fitness</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 07:00:08 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/17/fit-in-my-40s-running-zoe-williams</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15149b0b1e41243fda7ff2dc4c92c0aa54c81c66/0_147_6512_3908/master/6512.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=1d8b72b0e70f77ff31a15fd2b9c6adbb\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Kellie French for the Guardian</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15149b0b1e41243fda7ff2dc4c92c0aa54c81c66/0_147_6512_3908/master/6512.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=74ea6eb2569f30048323284130384f0a\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Kellie French for the Guardian</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Zoe Williams</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2018-02-17T07:00:08Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>Does cycling really damage men's sexual organs? | Jessica Brown</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2018/feb/16/does-cycling-really-damage-mens-sexual-organs</link>\r\n      <description>&lt;p&gt;New research refutes the theory that pressure from saddles can cause erectile dysfunction, and says cycling could actually improve performance in older men&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few doubt that cycling helps you get healthy. &lt;a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/357/bmj.j1944\"&gt;One study last year&lt;/a&gt; found cyclists are less likely to develop heart disease or cancer, and &lt;a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51054095_Health_benefits_of_cycling_A_systematic_review\"&gt;a 2011 review&lt;/a&gt; showed it improves fitness and leads to longer lives. But there\u2019s an area of men\u2019s health that has been the subject of a persistent question: does time spent in the saddle lead to problems in the sack?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, scientists have linked cycling with several male health problems, including erectile dysfunction, which they speculate is caused by the saddle decreasing blood flow to the penis. In one study, &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9150814\"&gt;Norwegian researchers&lt;/a&gt; gathered data from 160 men after they took part in a long-distance bike tour. They found that one in five suffered with numbness to the penis that lasted up to a week after the tour, and 13% developed erectile dysfunction that lasted more than a week in most cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2018/feb/16/does-cycling-really-damage-mens-sexual-organs\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/cycling\">Cycling</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/environment\">Environment</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/mens-health\">Men's health</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing\">Health &amp; wellbeing</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 07:30:38 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2018/feb/16/does-cycling-really-damage-mens-sexual-organs</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d208f448bd1b48c06050112f4685538bb95345fe/18_0_4860_2916/master/4860.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=863258cf789f984cb1d938757086a5fb\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Juan Moyano/Alamy</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d208f448bd1b48c06050112f4685538bb95345fe/18_0_4860_2916/master/4860.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=e6706936c998d482ac89955b4235cd11\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Juan Moyano/Alamy</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Jessica Brown</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2018-02-16T07:30:38Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>An updated formula for marathon-running success</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/feb/15/an-updated-formula-for-marathon-running-success</link>\r\n      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prediction calculators still give a rose-tinted view for most runners, says Fetcheveryone\u2019s Ian Williams. He takes another look at the stats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a real pleasure to see &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2017/mar/28/the-formula-for-marathon-success\"&gt;my marathon time predictor featured in the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; a few months back. My algorithm uses data from more than a thousand runners of varying abilities who have logged their training here on Fetcheveryone, to come up with a better prediction of marathon time. &lt;a href=\"https://www.fetcheveryone.com/training-calculators-improvedriegel.php\"&gt;You can try it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It\u2019s based on my view that the usefulness of the popular formula devised by Peter Riegel in 1977 starts to break down at marathon distance. This may well be because runners are often under-prepared for the rigours of the marathon, but it\u2019s arguably better for morale to smash a realistic goal than to burn out chasing an elusive one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/feb/15/an-updated-formula-for-marathon-running-success\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/running\">Running</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/fitness\">Fitness</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/marathon-running\">Marathon running</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 14:41:49 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/feb/15/an-updated-formula-for-marathon-running-success</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60ba62777c11f630a002269c8d7cdb49c78ab7af/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=04686ededff45facf1c6acb741b8f64c\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60ba62777c11f630a002269c8d7cdb49c78ab7af/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=991b2d3537e86fc8e01d2e93ded68d97\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Ian Williams</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2018-02-15T14:41:49Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>How was your weekend running?</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/feb/12/how-was-your-weekend-running</link>\r\n      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is there any way a tarmac and track-loving runner can be converted to the (ahem) joys of cross country? Share your top tips below the line - as well as your weekend exploits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can anyone tell me how I can learn to love cross country? Or is it a gene you are born with? Would greater exposure to it (I live in London - aside from the Surrey League fixtures, opportunities are minimal ...) engender affection? At any rate, it\u2019s certainly not my favourite kind of running, though the relief when it\u2019s over almost makes it worthwhile. No, wait, that\u2019s the cake my teammates bring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturday saw us in Richmond Park for the &lt;a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/1400596143\"&gt;final fixture of the season&lt;/a&gt; - a wonderful location for it, and complete with classic freezing cross country weather. I suppose at least I warmed up while running, unlike my poor kids who were dragged along and ended up wearing pretty much every discarded coat. And eating a fair amount of the cake. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/feb/12/how-was-your-weekend-running\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/running\">Running</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/fitness\">Fitness</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2018 09:15:10 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/feb/12/how-was-your-weekend-running</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95ed203894b87c2b18c3ca5a2e487836e6b54ff0/0_21_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=5d905670458ab910567eae1c666aa007\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Johnny Armstead/REX/Shutterstock</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95ed203894b87c2b18c3ca5a2e487836e6b54ff0/0_21_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=8d1c6dacbe40f227217cd919702a9686\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Johnny Armstead/REX/Shutterstock</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Kate Carter</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2018-02-12T09:15:10Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>An end to the dreadmill?  Zwift launches a running platform</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/feb/09/an-end-to-the-dreadmill-zwift-launches-a-running-platform</link>\r\n      <description>&lt;p&gt;The hugely popular virtual cycling platform now has a version for runners. But can running through a virtual world persuade a treadmill-phobe to hop on the belt?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have a theory about treadmill running. Much as a dog year supposedly equates to seven human years, so a mile run on a treadmill equates to seven run outdoor. It doesn\u2019t matter what tricks I try to make it more interesting, time on a treadmill passes slower than a snail on Valium through molasses. But could a saviour finally be at hand (or even foot) with the launch of Zwift running?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keen cyclists will probably already be familiar with the &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/06/virtual-world-cycle-training-haute-route-rockies-zwift\"&gt;hugely successful virtual platform&lt;/a&gt;. Launched in 2014, there are now 500,000 cyclists signed up, averaging 1m miles a day between them. Zwift is essentially a platform that gets you fitter, with a game element. You link up your home turbo trainer to a computer (or TV) using a speed or cadence sensor, and then, when cycling, you move \u2013 at the same speed you are cycling on the trainer \u2013 through a hyperreal virtual world. Alongside you are other athletes doing the same. That\u2019s one of the platform\u2019s USPs: all the people you see around you are \u201creal\u201d \u2013 there are no bots put into the game just to make it look busier. You can ride with a \u201creal\u201d group \u2013 or with a friend who happens to live on the other side of the world.

With the usual sea of cars, minibus taxis and &lt;em&gt;boda bodas&lt;/em&gt; (the city\u2019s famous motorbike taxis) absent, the whole road is visible and looks 10 times more spacious than usual. It has been adorned with colourful paintings \u2013 including green cycle lanes \u2013 and we can see people walking, talking and cycling, while children run around playing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a playground in the middle of a city where people rarely stop to play; there is too much work to be done. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to ride a bicycle, but I\u2019d like to learn,\u201d says Annette as she observes the scene, sighing: \u201cBut how can I learn?

With perfect timing, a US panel of experts in diet, obesity, diabetes, heart disease and food psychology has &lt;a href=\"https://health.usnews.com/best-diet\"&gt;scrutinised and ranked 40 diets&lt;/a&gt;. Its listings, which are produced annually, show which diets are best for short- and long-term weight loss, which are easiest to follow, which you are most likely to stick with \u2013 and which are unsafe because they don\u2019t supply enough nutrients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/05/what-best-diet-losing-weight-dash-mediterranean\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/diets-dieting\">Diets and dieting</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing\">Health &amp; wellbeing</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2018 16:18:37 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/05/what-best-diet-losing-weight-dash-mediterranean</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c786ee4d650651f1441c50b79553c4e5f03682c3/0_282_5459_3277/master/5459.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=1b009682395f896f411467961a73f8f3\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c786ee4d650651f1441c50b79553c4e5f03682c3/0_282_5459_3277/master/5459.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=64f3cffca7348a68744ee97a0953fd55\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Luisa Dillner</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2018-01-05T16:18:37Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>Is owning a dog good for your health?</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/04/is-owning-a-dog-good-for-your-health</link>\r\n      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests canine-lovers could be 23% less likely to die from heart disease \u2013 or it could just be that healthier people prefer dogs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs really are our best friends, &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-16118-6\" title=\"\"&gt;according to a Swedish study&lt;/a&gt; that says canine ownership could reduce heart disease.

Previous studies have found between 4% and 10% of men, while, in this smallish sample of 447 Swedish fathers who volunteered (and may therefore not represent your average dad), a surprising 28% of men had symptoms that scored above mild levels of depression. Overall, 4% had moderate depression. Fewer than one in five fathers who were depressed sought help, even though a third of those had thought about harming themselves.

So should you keep booze out of the family home?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you\u2019re drinking wine at home, don\u2019t look as if you\u2019re enjoying it \u2013 at least not if you have kids. How much you drink, how often you say: \u2018Ah, that\u2019s nice,\u2019 while imbibing and whether you use alcohol as a reward or coping mechanism can all encourage adolescents to drink, according to &lt;a href=\"http://www.ias.org.uk/uploads/pdf/IAS%20reports/rp28102017.pdf\"&gt;a report last week from the Institute of Alcohol Studies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you think it\u2019s OK for teenagers to drink, the Department of Health advises children have an alcohol-free life until the age of 15 and only one drink a week until they are 18. In 2009, Prof Liam Donaldson, the Chief Medical Officer at the time, warned that \u201cexposing children to drink-fuelled events\u201d was one of the root causes of the UK\u2019s drinking problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/23/should-i-avoid-drinking-in-front-of-my-children\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/alcohol\">Alcohol</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/food-and-drink\">Food &amp; drink</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing\">Health &amp; wellbeing</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2017 06:00:13 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/23/should-i-avoid-drinking-in-front-of-my-children</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492a5691d5c72b489d5046b427f3457e6947f2a7/0_9_3752_2251/master/3752.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=2df3bee75b8304437e64218d4a128226\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: NataliaDeriabina/Getty Images/iStockphoto</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492a5691d5c72b489d5046b427f3457e6947f2a7/0_9_3752_2251/master/3752.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d2f114f98586a9a8d696bbb5e4c478c3\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: NataliaDeriabina/Getty Images/iStockphoto</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Luisa Dillner</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2017-10-23T06:00:13Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>After my wife\u2019s death, I want to start dating again</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/16/after-wifes-death-want-start-dating-children</link>\r\n      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am still only 27 and feel ready to meet a new partner, but I don\u2019t know how to tell our two small children, let alone raise the subject with any woman I might be interested in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 18 months ago, and after four years of happy marriage, my wife suddenly died.

By her own admission, she is sexually inexperienced. She describes her previous sex life with her husband as \u201clie back and think of England\u201d and says they only had sex when he wanted it, with no foreplay. I like to consider my partner\u2019s wants and needs \u2013 which she doesn\u2019t seem to think she should have. I am trying to be patient, but want us to have a deep, meaningful sexual relationship where we can both tell each other what we enjoy and how to enjoy it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need simple patience. Truly intimate sexual communication is an advanced lovemaking ability. When a person has been sexually deprived in the way you describe, it takes time to learn to receive pleasure as well as to give it. This task is potentially more difficult than you might think, because your new partner has been conditioned to ignore her own desires and respond only to the needs of a partner. Bypassing one\u2019s true feelings or submitting to sex without desire \u2013 especially long-term \u2013 can lead to significant sexual apathy, while intercourse without physiological arousal can instigate chronic sexual avoidance and even a sexual pain disorder. You are very much on the right track in your wish to help her reclaim her sexual self, but do not discount the possibility that she might feel deeply guilty about allowing herself to experience pleasure, and that overcoming this sense of being undeserving could take considerable time. Be careful not to replace her previous partner\u2019s tyranny with a different kind of coercion \u2013 that of having unrealistic expectations that she should quickly enjoy sex more. She probably feels considerable shame about her past sex life and lack of experience, so acute sensitivity is required. Respect her pace and, above all, do not let her feel coerced into trying to please you by forcing pleasure on herself ... or even feigning it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/12/my-new-partner-is-used-only-to-lying-back-and-thinking-of-england\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/relationships\">Relationships</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2018 06:10:49 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/12/my-new-partner-is-used-only-to-lying-back-and-thinking-of-england</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fd9ff9c79269aea4b701ce245d9ffa540ec7ed4/0_0_8533_5120/master/8533.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=8143f5e282c1bbb7cdc9d0b86b4c7139\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Guardian Design Team</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fd9ff9c79269aea4b701ce245d9ffa540ec7ed4/0_0_8533_5120/master/8533.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=25230373a8ee519f94573e93b388617b\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Guardian Design Team</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Pamela Stephenson Connolly</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2018-02-12T06:10:49Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>My husband died and my son is angry I\u2019m in a new relationship | Dear Mariella</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/18/my-husband-died-and-my-son-is-angry-i-am-in-a-new-relationship-mariella-frostrup</link>\r\n      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mothers and sons is the greatest love story never told, says Mariella Frostrup. Stay patient but don\u2019t stop seeing your new lover&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dilemma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; My husband died suddenly early last year. It has been tough for me and for my teen/20s children. We\u2019ve worked hard to support our grief and have been close. They have lovely friends and special loves who have been wonderful and supportive \u2013 and they are OK, me too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have become close to someone I have known vaguely for 10 years. He is lovely and we seem to have embarked on something special. In our 50s neither of us want to fanny about and he seems willing to accept the baggage I carry (and he has some, too).&amp;nbsp;I feel the same. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/18/my-husband-died-and-my-son-is-angry-i-am-in-a-new-relationship-mariella-frostrup\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/relationships\">Relationships</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/family\">Family</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 06:00:36 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/18/my-husband-died-and-my-son-is-angry-i-am-in-a-new-relationship-mariella-frostrup</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4da48a491f82d210e0476d228651ac1a361879af/0_0_4734_2840/master/4734.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=75f84302c6e30c3091f4d367be32cc96\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Caiaimage/Sam Edwards/Getty Images</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4da48a491f82d210e0476d228651ac1a361879af/0_0_4734_2840/master/4734.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=5ddd0b366b2f72d717922605ea37c090\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Caiaimage/Sam Edwards/Getty Images</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Mariella Frostrup</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2018-02-18T06:00:36Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n  </channel>\r\n</rss>\r\n\r\n",
