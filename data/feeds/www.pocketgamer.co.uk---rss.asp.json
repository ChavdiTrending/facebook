And we couldn't be more excited. If you're not playing it already, this is the perfect time to get into it - it's free for single player games too, so don't be afraid to dive in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Multiplayer's where it's at now, though. Aside from being the most anticipated update of the game so far it's also the biggest and opens up the universe further than ever before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I've been playing Polytopia's multiplayer update for the best part of a week now and, genuinely, I think this might be the next big thing on mobile.

It&#8217;s another game worthy of adding to your ever-growing collection of quality Nindies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game is a text-based mystery in which you investigate the disappearance of a large number of sentient robots. You&#8217;ll ride around the city&#8217;s underground subway system to speak to other robot workers, or Teks, and try to uncover clues. &lt;em&gt;Subsurface Circular&lt;/em&gt; is quite understated, set in a single train car, but the story expertly reveals itself is small bits and pieces, keeping you hooked from the get-go. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Switch/Subsurface+Circular/news.asp?c=76713'&gt;[read more]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>\r\n<link>http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Switch/Subsurface+Circular/news.asp?c=76713</link>\r\n<pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 14:32:12 GMT</pubDate>\r\n</item>\r\n<item>\r\n<title>Give your campsite some razzle dazzle in Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp's Crystal Collection Event</title>\r\n<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/artwork/thumbs/na-ehukxd_screen_shot_2017-10-25_at_07_27_39_png_100.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;Give your campsite some razzle dazzle in Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp's Crystal Collection Event&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin:5px 10px 10px 0px;&quot;&gt; The latest &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp&lt;/em&gt; event went live this weekend, &lt;a href=&quot;/r/iPhone/Animal+Crossing+Pocket+Camp/news.asp?c=76691&quot;&gt;fresh on the heels of the game's biggest update yet&lt;/a&gt;. This time around, the game wants you to turn your campsite into a crystalline winter wonderland. The Crystal Collection Event will see you gathering crystal shards in the usual fashion&#8212;by completing animal requests. Once you gather enough, you can craft crystal-themed goodies. Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s up for grabs this time around:&#160;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crystal Mist: 10 crystal shards and 100 bells&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crystal Mist Elite: 10 crystal shards and 100 bells&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blue Rug: 15 crystal shards and 100 bells&lt;/li&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Animal+Crossing+Pocket+Camp/news.asp?c=76712'&gt;[read more]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>\r\n<link>http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Animal+Crossing+Pocket+Camp/news.asp?c=76712</link>\r\n<pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 14:28:48 GMT</pubDate>\r\n</item>\r\n<item>\r\n<title>Review: Nitro Racing GO review - A painfully pedestrian clicker</title>\r\n<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.pocketgamer.co.uk/artwork/imgthumbs/na-pvyl/nitrogo.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;Nitro Racing GO review - A painfully pedestrian clicker&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin:5px 10px 10px 0px;&quot;&gt; Do you like tapping your phone screen a lot? Do you like cars? Do you like arbitrary reward systems as much as you despise skill? Then boy, do I have a game for you!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, &lt;em&gt;Nitro Racing GO&lt;/em&gt; is a tapper/clicker. I understand that this fact may make a large proportion of you reach for the 'back' button. Don't worry, I won't be offended. I'd probably do the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still here? Okay then. Let's hit the road. Or rather, tap it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noisy tap-its&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So &lt;em&gt;Nitro Racing GO&lt;/em&gt;. It's a clicker/tapper with a street racing theme. You hammer away at the screen with your finger - tippy-tappy, tippy-tappy - while a bar steadily fills up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, there's also a car driving along an endless highway while you're doing this, overtaking other 'racers'. But that's kind of by the by, as your tapping bears no meaningful relation to the action as far as I can tell. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Nitro+Racing+GO/review.asp?c=76711'&gt;[read more]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>\r\n<link>http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Nitro+Racing+GO/review.asp?c=76711</link>\r\n<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 18:03:55 GMT</pubDate>\r\n</item>\r\n<item>\r\n<title>App Army Assemble: Purrfect Date - A graphic novel worth sinking your claws into?</title>\r\n<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/artwork/thumbs/na-azcdphj_logo_-_purrfect_date_png_100.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;App Army Assemble: Purrfect Date - A graphic novel worth sinking your claws into?&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin:5px 10px 10px 0px;&quot;&gt; Ever wanted to get down and dirty with cats? By that I mean, ever wanted to befriend and potentially date them?&#160;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We asked our elite App Army that very question and someone them have some very definite opinions on the matter. But, will Purrfect Date be meowgnificent? Or will it leave them feline a bit rough?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theresa Kresleyu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Purrfect Date is unusual game in own genre. Fans of visual novels should definitely play it. However, there are drawbacks: firstly, there is almost no black comedy in the game. Black and comedy go separately. Secondly, there are some unsuccessful game design decisions such as the lack of the ability to rewind already seen text, which complicates the replaying the game -&#160; a mandatory attribute of any visual novel game!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game is very good for fans of the genre, but if you get annoyed when you see a lot of text just skip this game. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Purrfect+Date/feature.asp?c=76710'&gt;[read more]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>\r\n<link>http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Purrfect+Date/feature.asp?c=76710</link>\r\n<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 17:03:32 GMT</pubDate>\r\n</item>\r\n<item>\r\n<title>Pocket Gamer Podcast: Episode 431 - Florence, PUBG Mobile</title>\r\n<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.pocketgamer.co.uk/artwork/imgthumbs/na-jmah/pg_podcast_450.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;Pocket Gamer Podcast: Episode 431 - Florence, PUBG Mobile&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin:5px 10px 10px 0px;&quot;&gt; This week has it all: from plot-free sandboxes of endless multiplayer violence to short, heartfelt, narrative-driven experiences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, we take a look at the Chinese version of &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; on mobile, then play &lt;em&gt;Monument Valley&lt;/em&gt; co-creator Ken Wong's delightful interactive story &lt;em&gt;Florence&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We also talk to the man himself, as well as checking out the rest of the week's new mobile releases including puzzler &lt;em&gt;Death Squared&lt;/em&gt;, cat-romancing sim &lt;em&gt;Purrfect Date&lt;/em&gt;, plus&#160;&lt;em&gt;Bayonetta&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bayonetta 2&lt;/em&gt; on Switch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Download episode 431:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/media/pgtv/pgtv.iphone.ep431.mp3&quot;&gt;MP3&lt;/a&gt;&#160;&lt;/strong&gt;(right click to save-as, left click to play)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/pocket-gamer-iphone-podcast/id300280568?i=87169637&quot;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&#160; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Pocket+Gamer+Podcast/news.asp?c=76709'&gt;[read more]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>\r\n<link>http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Pocket+Gamer+Podcast/news.asp?c=76709</link>\r\n<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 16:44:12 GMT</pubDate>\r\n</item>\r\n<item>\r\n<title>Registration is up for Hearthstone's 2018 Wild Open - Could it be you scooping the grand prize?</title>\r\n<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/artwork/thumbs/na-nsgtl_hearthstone-wild-open_png_100.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;Registration is up for Hearthstone's 2018 Wild Open - Could it be you scooping the grand prize?&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin:5px 10px 10px 0px;&quot;&gt; Want to get in on the 2018 Hearthstone Wild Open?

This year is the year of the dog. Dogs are cool. Some of them are fluffy, some of them aren't fluffy, and almost all of them are super cute drool monsters who want to be your best friend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which got me thinking. What would a dog's favourite mobile game be? And not just one dog, lots of different dogs, pictures of which I have found from various sources on the internet? That's right, once again I'm answering the big questions that no one else has the guts to ask.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big Beethoven Dog&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:OllieSilke.jpg&quot;&gt;Image source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Big Beethoven Dogs like saving people in the cold. They have a pouch on their neck that is often filled with life-bringing booze. When they shake their heads loads of slobber flies off and it gets on all of your stuff but you don't mind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Monument+Valley/feature.asp?c=76707'&gt;[read more]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>\r\n<link>http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Monument+Valley/feature.asp?c=76707</link>\r\n<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 16:08:22 GMT</pubDate>\r\n</item>\r\n<item>\r\n<title>Catch these Pokemon in Pokemon GO and celebrate this Lunar New Year with extra Stardust</title>\r\n<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.pocketgamer.co.uk/artwork/imgthumbs/na-vmyp/169.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;Catch these Pokemon in Pokemon GO and celebrate this Lunar New Year with extra Stardust&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin:5px 10px 10px 0px;&quot;&gt; Happy Friday and a happy Lunar New Year to all of those celebrating it.

Otherwise your fighter could very well slam into the '6' block before you've managed to reduce it to zero.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you've ever played Voodoo's &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;r/iPhone/Dunk+Hit/feature.asp?c=75556&quot;&gt;Snake VS Block&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (or something similar), you'll be familiar with the principle - though &lt;em&gt;Cmnd/ctrl&lt;/em&gt; makes it feel more like a classic vertically scrolling shmup. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Cmnd%2Fctrl/review.asp?c=76702'&gt;[read more]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>\r\n<link>http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Cmnd%2Fctrl/review.asp?c=76702</link>\r\n<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n</item>\r\n<item>\r\n<title>Steredenn: Binary Edition is an indie you need to add to your Nintendo Switch library</title>\r\n<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/artwork/thumbs/na-tkecco_steredenn-ios-icon_png_100.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;Steredenn: Binary Edition is an indie you need to add to your Nintendo Switch library&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin:5px 10px 10px 0px;&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In more good Nintendo indie news, &lt;em&gt;Steredenn&lt;/em&gt; is coming to the Nintendo Switch in a new, expanded format. The new version, &lt;em&gt;Steredenn: Binary Stars&lt;/em&gt;, promises plentiful new content, along with much improved optimization, balancing, and other little tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pixelnest Studio&#8217;s pretty little schmup landed on iOS last year, and we were quickly drawn in by &lt;em&gt;Steredenn&#8217;s&lt;/em&gt; sprawling perks and weapon system (&lt;a href=&quot;/r/iPad/Steredenn/review.asp?c=73946&quot;&gt;so much so, we gave it a Gold Award&lt;/a&gt;). Players can choose from over 42 weapons and nearly as many upgrades in this space adventure. Pilot your own ship while shooting at the hordes of enemies the game throws at you in its randomly generated levels. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Switch/Steredenn/news.asp?c=76704'&gt;[read more]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>\r\n<link>http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Switch/Steredenn/news.asp?c=76704</link>\r\n<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 00:15:51 GMT</pubDate>\r\n</item>\r\n<item>\r\n<title>Portal Knights is giving you new reasons to explore in its latest update </title>\r\n<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.pocketgamer.co.uk/artwork/imgthumbs/na-mrpws/portalknightsthumb.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;Portal Knights is giving you new reasons to explore in its latest update &quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin:5px 10px 10px 0px;&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Portal Knights&lt;/em&gt; Adventurer Update, out now, is sure to please folks looking for fresh quests and treasure to fill out their sandbox. The update is a doozy, with new characters, items, quests, and other general improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Adventurer Update introduces a new warrior guild that adds new NPCs, quests, and items in the new Fort Finch. Players can find new items and accessories to help them build unique bases. Players will now also have the ability to teleport NPCs to their home world to add some life to their islands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Combat, too, is about to get a lot more interesting. More than 20 new weapons have been added to the mix, and weapon crafting will be a bit more intuitive. And for all you dungeon crawlers out there, you&#8217;ll find treasure chests hiding in the darkest, most dangerous tunnels within the dungeons. &lt;em&gt;Portal Knights&lt;/em&gt; now also supports MFi controllers, if you prefer to forgo the touch controls. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Portal+Knights/news.asp?c=76703'&gt;[read more]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>\r\n<link>http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Portal+Knights/news.asp?c=76703</link>\r\n<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 00:10:56 GMT</pubDate>\r\n</item>\r\n</channel>\r\n</rss>\r\n",
