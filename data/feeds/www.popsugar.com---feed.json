While Jen&#039;s tried on countless fits, too, (admittedly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/Jennifer-Aniston-Skinny-Jeans-41023831&quot; &gt;she doesn&#039;t love the skinny&lt;/a&gt; but wore them for her ex-husband, Justin Theroux, who was a fan), we like her best in a slouch. She appears effortless and comfortable lounging on her furniture in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/buy/GRLFRND-Women-Karolina-Distressed-Skinny-Jeans-543156129?evar1=fab%3Aus&amp;evar98=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.popsugar.com%2Fm%2Fapi%2Fv2%2Fposts&amp;prop13=desktop&amp;brand=GRLFRND&amp;price=248&amp;retailer=Barneys%20New%20York&amp;p_name=Women%27s%20Karolina%20Distressed%20Skinny%20Jeans&amp;pdata=1&amp;label=GRLFRND%20Skinny%20Denim&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Grlfrnd pair&lt;/a&gt; ($248). &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jen completed her outfit with some classic jewelry, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/Jennifer-Aniston-Wedding-Band-44054372&quot; &gt;her Jennifer Meyer wedding ring set&lt;/a&gt;, and talked to the magazine about her taste. &quot;Sexy is important, but comfort is essential,&quot; she said, regarding the style of her living room. While Jen might have been referring to sofas, we think that notion also speaks to her signature true blues. Since that&#039;s a look you probably want to get in on too, we found Jen&#039;s exact jeans, along with very similar options ahead.

This was by far the most stressful time of my life. Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Things-Only-Working-Moms-Understand-35462688&quot;&gt;most working parents&lt;/a&gt;, I felt that I was half-assing my job and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Advice-New-Moms-Going-Back-Work-43107463&quot;&gt;half-assing my kid&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We decided to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/How-Choose-Right-Day-Care-44341565&quot;&gt;send him to day care rather than a nanny&lt;/a&gt; because we wanted him to be around other kids and liked the idea that we may meet a friend or two in the process. I always felt confident with the three amazing women who watched him during the day, and he was with just five other kids who were all the same age. Each day we were given a progress sheet of the exact times he ate, took a nap, and had his diaper changed. It was the ideal setup.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;related-stories&quot;&gt;Related&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Why-Hard-Get-Out-House-Little-Kids-39752729&quot;&gt;17 Reasons My Daughter Was Late For School This Morning&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;pullquote-container&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;The whole idea was so overwhelming that I just did nothing. And there I was so quick and ready to blame someone else for a perfectly explainable situation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Everything was going smoothly until the day I came to pick him up and saw a HUGE scratch across his face. And it wasn&#039;t just a little red spot, but literally a huge red line across his face. My jaw hit the ground and I was ready to pounce. I ran over to the caretaker who was busy with a fussy baby. Her English was not great, so I was having a hard time trying to figure out what happened. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&#039;t understand why no one had called me, or even seemed worried that something was wrong. I was about to run over to talk to the head of the day care, when I glanced at my daily progress sheet and saw the following note:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Dear Ms. Jennifer. Please, please cut Beckett&#039;s nails tonight. They are very long. Thank you!&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh no. It was my fault. I felt my body shrink down into my coat, grabbed Beckett, and got out of there as fast as I could.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;related-stories&quot;&gt;Related&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Firstborn-Parenting-Regrets-44435898&quot;&gt;Dear Firstborn, This Is My Biggest Parenting Regret&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course they didn&#039;t know that as a first-time mom, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Milestones-New-Parents-Should-Celebrate-35983283&quot;&gt;I was TERRIFIED to cut his nails&lt;/a&gt;. I was so afraid that I would cut his skin, or give him an in-grown nail. I mean, what if he moved his fingers and I accidentally drew blood? The whole idea was so overwhelming that I just did nothing. And there I was so quick and ready to blame someone else for a perfectly explainable situation. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Us parents tend to be pretty protective of our children (as we should) and like to think that any problems that arise were caused by someone else. This was the first of many experiences when I learned that initial instinct to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.com/moms/photo-gallery/41024887/image/41024905/Mama-Bear-Thing&quot;&gt;act like a mama bear&lt;/a&gt; isn&#039;t always the way to go. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as I got home and told my husband, he happily cut Beckett&#039;s nails. It was so anticlimatic that it was hard to believe I was even worried in the first place. We laughed and called him &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/home/Scarface-House-Sale-37123453&quot;&gt;&quot;Scarface&quot;&lt;/a&gt; for days.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;related-stories&quot;&gt;Related&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Should-You-Let-Your-Kids-Quit-Sport-44369386&quot;&gt;I Won&#039;t Let My Kids Quit a Sport (or Any Activity) Midseason&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When I dropped him off the next morning, I found out that when he had scratched his own face, he didn&#039;t even cry. I apologized, laughed at myself for being so upset, and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Truth-About-Being-Work-From-Home-Mom-37705937&quot;&gt;went to work&lt;/a&gt; with my head held high. I was ashamed, yes, but I was grateful to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Parenting-Lessons-40284773&quot;&gt;learned the first of many important lessons as a parent&lt;/a&gt; - don&#039;t jump to conclusions, and always ask questions. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Years later when Beckett was in preschool, he came home and told me that one child had hit him. I went to the head of the school, who told me to ask my son &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; his friend had hit him. I did just that, and he confessed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/What-Your-Child-Bully-37714043&quot;&gt;he had taken a toy away from his friend&lt;/a&gt;. So, it turns out my angel wasn&#039;t so perfect.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Protecting your child is a parent&#039;s number one job, but in order to be that great parent we all want to be, you can&#039;t always take their side. Before you start to raise hell in defense of your child, take a minute to ask a question and see if, just maybe, there&#039;s a bit more to the story.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Personal Essay\">Personal Essay</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Little Kids\">Little Kids</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Babies\">Babies</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Motherhood\">Motherhood</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Parenting\">Parenting</category>\n <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 08:40:07 -0800</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Jennifer Scallon</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">44471515</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>Should You Cut Your Baby&#039;s Nails?</search_title>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title>I&#039;m Letting My Daughter Choose When (and If) She Wants to Shave Her Legs</title>\n <link>https://www.popsugar.com/moms/What-Age-Should-Girls-Start-Shaving-Legs-44487218</link>\n <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/What-Age-Should-Girls-Start-Shaving-Legs-44487218&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;160&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; src=&quot;https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/iMWb_9q2E8B1Tq3lMqUwUEaFBJI/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/01/12/710/n/44080669/3138fd605a58dc54ce07a2.72331671_edit_img_image_44487218_1515518566.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My daughter is not yet 5, but she already has questions about shaving - why do I do it, where do I do it, why do other kids do it, and when should she do it? She&#039;s started noting the growth of hair on her legs, and while she hasn&#039;t outright asked for it yet (right now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Should-I-Pierce-My-Daughter-Ears-43690745&quot;&gt;the big push is for pierced ears&lt;/a&gt;), I can tell the conversation is coming.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s not like it&#039;s a surprise. With the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/How-Shave-Your-Legs-23382374&quot;&gt;wealth of information in pop culture about shaving&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a mom who models it every day (we live in the tropics, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Should-I-Shave-My-Legs-Winter-43005130&quot;&gt;I shave even in Winter&lt;/a&gt;), it would be more surprising if she didn&#039;t display interest.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s not the fact that she&#039;s already interested that worries me, but more so the nature of the conversation we&#039;ll inevitably have about it. What bothers me is that she&#039;s already clear on the fact that shaving legs and armpits is a &quot;girl thing,&quot; while shaving the face is a &quot;guy thing.&quot; When looking up resources for how to talk about this and when to make my decision, I&#039;ve seen a few major gaps in the discourse. The conversation needs to change, and my husband and I are doing our best.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;related-stories&quot;&gt;Related&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Remembering-Big-Picture-Parenting-41104852&quot;&gt;How a Stranger&#039;s Comment Changed the Way I Parent&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;pullquote-container&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;I also want to let her know about the option of not shaving her legs, which is something that&#039;s being embraced by more and more women.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Right now, my daughter is too young, and I&#039;ve been clear about that. My reasoning for her thus far has been &quot;razors are dangerous,&quot; and she also just isn&#039;t that bothered by her extremely minimal leg hair. Shaving, however, won&#039;t depend on her reaching a certain age. Personally, I was miserable waiting until 12 years old to shave. I was the last girl in my class by a few years, and it was horrible during gym class and the Summer. I don&#039;t want that for my kids if they feel like shaving will make them feel more confident. Instead of setting an age limit, I&#039;m keeping the lines of communication open until it actively becomes something that bothers my daughter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One thing I&#039;m keeping in mind for our future chats is letting her know about the option of &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; shaving her legs. A typical conversation on shaving can run something like this: &quot;Mom, when can I shave my legs?&quot; &quot;When you&#039;re [old enough/responsible enough/in high school/leave the house].&quot; That, to me, is an incomplete conversation, because it totally misses the option of NEVER shaving your legs. That&#039;s also a legitimate option, and one that is being embraced by more and more women. Even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Fitness-Blogger-Stops-Shaving-Legs-Armpits-43446973&quot;&gt;public figures are choosing not to shave&lt;/a&gt;, which I find refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;related-stories&quot;&gt;Related&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Pit-Bulls-Dangerous-44489269&quot;&gt;We Have a Pit Bull as a Family Pet, and We Couldn&#039;t Be Happier&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing I want her to know is that shaving body hair is NOT limited to girls and women. What about men? What about guys who like a smooth shave on their legs, armpits, arms, chests . . . or other places? Why should my son feel like this isn&#039;t an option for him, if later in life his true self is hairless? My husband and I have been very careful to explain that &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; men and women find this nicer to look at and feel, while others do not.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Women also shouldn&#039;t feel humiliated by shaving their lips or chins. Hair happens. We don&#039;t ask for it, and I think it&#039;s important we de-stigmatize facial shaving for women. This too is a topic we discuss openly, and we&#039;ve been gratified to see a major decrease of the girl vs. boy standards my kids are clearly getting from somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The bottom line? The responsibility of shaving, as well as the philosophy, is up to them. Until then, the conversation stays open.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Personal Essay\">Personal Essay</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Parenting Tips and Advice\">Parenting Tips and Advice</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Daughters\">Daughters</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Girls\">Girls</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Motherhood\">Motherhood</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Shaving\">Shaving</category>\n <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 08:40:06 -0800</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Sarah Beth Moore</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">44487218</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>What Age Should Girls Start Shaving Their Legs?</search_title>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title>I Have Bipolar Disorder, and Here&#039;s How I Talk To My Kids About Mental Health</title>\n <link>https://www.popsugar.com/moms/How-Talk-Your-Kids-About-Mental-Health-44484739</link>\n <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/How-Talk-Your-Kids-About-Mental-Health-44484739&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;160&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; src=&quot;https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/hxbGIp3wjsbB5jB2tZrZA0Ct6Xg/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/01/11/713/n/44461868/ac4debcc5a578bd19981c8.20659906_edit_img_image_44484739_1515447678.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Explaining-Emotions-Healthy-Outlets-Anger-Kids-44330716&quot;&gt;Teaching my children empathy&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most important priorities for me as a mom, because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Choosing-Have-Kids-When-You-Bipolar-43738327&quot;&gt;I have bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;. While I don&#039;t feel the need (yet) to explain the specifics of my disorder to my 3-year-old and 6-month-old, I want them to know that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/How-Manage-Depression-Work-44265092&quot;&gt;mental health disorders exist&lt;/a&gt;, despite the fact that we can&#039;t physically see them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Helping a child understand why someone may be feeling a certain way is important for their own personal growth, but having these conversations isn&#039;t always easy. Because I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Daily-Habits-Manage-Mental-Health-44365851&quot;&gt;struggled with a mental health illness&lt;/a&gt;, I&#039;m much more aware of why it&#039;s so important for kids to learn about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;related-stories&quot;&gt;Related&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/smart-living/Why-You-Shouldnt-Ashamed-Mental-Illness-42263909&quot;&gt;Why I&#039;m Not Ashamed to Talk About My Mental Illness&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;pullquote-container&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;If everyone could be a little more open to the &quot;why&quot; behind things, the world would be a much brighter place.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I remember when I was in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/What-School-Like-Kids-42122506&quot;&gt;elementary school&lt;/a&gt;, the counselor would come in for lessons about &quot;warm fuzzies&quot; and &quot;cold pricklies.&quot; Using light and fun language like this helped us to understand how we were feeling and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/How-Teach-Kids-Kindness-42713539&quot;&gt;how to treat others&lt;/a&gt;. Sharing &quot;warm fuzzies&quot; makes our friends happy, and sending out &quot;cold pricklies&quot; doesn&#039;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to fun &quot;games&quot; like this, one thing I also do when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Raising-Caring-Kids-37852952&quot;&gt;trying to educate my children&lt;/a&gt; on mental health is allow them to study my face when I&#039;m upset, or ask them to look at another child&#039;s body language after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/How-Tell-Your-Child-Bully-34675118&quot;&gt;someone said something hurtful&lt;/a&gt;. I&#039;ll ask my daughter if she can think of reasons why someone might look angry or sad, then we talk about ways we can change this. I tell her that by trying to understand why people are feeling a certain way, she can offer compassion. And if she can&#039;t make them feel better, she can know that it&#039;s not her fault.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;related-stories&quot;&gt;Related&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/How-Encourage-Your-Daughter-44477804&quot;&gt;Things I Whisper to My Daughter&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But the most important thing any parent can do is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Signs-Your-Partner-Great-Parent-42473007&quot;&gt;lead by example&lt;/a&gt;, show kindness and compassion to others in front of their children, and communicate their importance. If a child comes into contact with someone battling the demons of mental health, the hope is that the child will try to understand the reason behind someone&#039;s behavior instead of judging them at face value. If everyone could be a little more open to considering the &quot;why&quot; behind things, I think the world would be a much brighter place.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Personal Essay\">Personal Essay</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Little Kids\">Little Kids</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Parenting Tips and Advice\">Parenting Tips and Advice</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Parenting\">Parenting</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Kids\">Kids</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Mental Health\">Mental Health</category>\n <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 08:40:06 -0800</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Caitlyn Doenges</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">44484739</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>How to Talk to Your Kids About Mental Health</search_title>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title>The Names of Chip and Joanna Gaines&#039;s Kids Are Just as Rustic and Sweet as They Are</title>\n <link>https://www.popsugar.com/moms/What-Names-Chip-Joanna-Gaines-Kids-44556855</link>\n <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/What-Names-Chip-Joanna-Gaines-Kids-44556855&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;160&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; src=&quot;https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/IkmkzF7UHDfkutRNoXfGyWuseuQ/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/02/06/717/n/41205124/ebcd86bf5a79d3f9ea5744.98523688_edit_img_image_44556855_1517880622.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-permalink=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BNMlcIthBgV/&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;8&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot; class=&quot;insta-preview-v1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=&#039;  line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:33.101851851851855% 0; text-align:center; width:100%; background:url(&quot;https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/285199abf6372c2bf6d42a07d6548ab0/5B01648C/t51.2885-15/e35/13827476_1832010417080127_1081809198511030272_n.jpg&quot;); background-size:contain;&#039;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BNMlcIthBgV/&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A post shared by HGTV (@hgtv)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-11-24T14:42:24+00:00&quot;&gt;Nov 24, 2016 at 6:42am PST&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s easy to think that Chip and Joanna Gaines&#039;s top priority is transforming homes all around Texas for their hit HGTV show &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Fixer-Upper&quot; &gt;&lt;b&gt;Fixer Upper&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but really, they&#039;re all about their kids and each other (Chip recently dished on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Chip-Joanna-Gaines-Secrets-Successful-Marriage-44338842&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the secret to their successful marriage&lt;/a&gt;, and it&#039;s adorable).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While the couple, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/home/Facts-About-Fixer-Upper-Chip-Joanna-Gaines-37457565&quot; &gt;tied the knot in 2003&lt;/a&gt;, have tried to keep &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/home/Pictures-Chip-Joanna-Gaines-Kids-41180996&quot; &gt;their kids&lt;/a&gt; - Drake, Ella Rose, Duke, and Emmie Kay - mostly out of the spotlight, they have occasionally let them appear on their TV show, which will sadly be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/home/When-Fixer-Upper-Ending-44074752&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ending after season five&lt;/a&gt;.

There&#039;s no surefire way of telling whether or not &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Cheating-Tendencies-According-Zodiac-Signs-44512767&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a relationship will last&lt;/a&gt;, but astrology can give us pretty big hints about what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/love/Surprising-Zodiac-Sign-Qualities-43737365&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;traits could permanently damage a marriage&lt;/a&gt;. Here are the signs that are most likely to divorce, ranked from most to least.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;related-stories&quot;&gt;Related&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Moms-According-Zodiac-Signs-44077073&quot;&gt;Zodiac Signs Who Make Great Moms, Ranked From BEST to WORST&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Capricorn.&lt;/strong&gt; Capricorns have a lot of lovely qualities that help in a relationship, but even though they are known for being intelligent and honest, they are also known for caring about themselves more than others. This serious sign has confidence for days and has a low tolerance for anyone who doesn&#039;t see things their way. The best thing for a Capricorn to do in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Reasons-Youre-Having-Sex-Your-Spouse-44363826&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a long-term relationship&lt;/a&gt; is to try to relax and understand where their partner is coming from. If they don&#039;t, things might take a disastrous turn.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Aquarius.&lt;/strong&gt; Independent and flighty are two overwhelming traits of the Aquarius spouse, neither of which make for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Questions-Ask-Your-Spouse-Make-Them-Feel-Heard-44354814&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a strong marriage&lt;/a&gt;. Sure, this trait makes a great friend and a fun child, but as a partner it can be a little exhausting. A relationship is the coming together of two people, and compromise needs to happen for a strong and successful marriage.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Virgo.&lt;/strong&gt; Virgos are lovely, strong-minded people. They often bring out the best in their partner, by helping accomplish goals and thinking about the future. However, they also have a tendency to get frustrated when things don&#039;t go the way they had intended. To ensure a happy marriage with a Virgo, acknowledge their plans and do what you can to help. It will mean a lot to them, and in return they can be loyal partners.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Sagittarius.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/love/Reasons-Travel-Couple-35240929&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Born travelers&lt;/a&gt;, this fire sign definitely has some spunk. This can make for a fun-filled and adventurous relationship, or it can lead to some serious problems. Since they are also known for being impatient and lacking diplomacy, a spouse of a Sagittarius needs to grow a thick skin and learn to appreciate spontaneous moments.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Scorpio.&lt;/strong&gt; Scorpios are extremely passionate individuals who love making others feel appreciated, as long as they get it in return. They can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/love/How-Get-Over-Your-First-Love-38683232&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the greatest love a person has ever had&lt;/a&gt;, but be aware of the Scorpio&#039;s jealousy. That sting, which can be fierce, stems from the fact that they expect a lot from their partners. If you&#039;re an honest and loving partner, than a Scorpio spouse will be an ideal partner.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Aries.&lt;/strong&gt; Curious, passionate, and loving, an Aries partner is pretty great. This love can last a lifetime, as long as the spouse can handle all of their personality quirks. Energy abounds with this sign, and it&#039;s not always stable. They have a tendency to want to try new things and consequently have been known to make some bad decisions. Find a way to honor their energy while at the same time helping them make good choices.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Gemini.&lt;/strong&gt; There are two sides to a Gemini. While there is the risk that this sign will be ruled by indecisiveness and occasional bouts of sullenness, the more dominant traits are perfect for maintaining a healthy and loving relationship. Gentle and affectionate, this is a sign that cares deeply about their family and loved ones. Being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/love/What-Does-Mercury-Retrograde-Mean-43427131&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ruled by Mercury&lt;/a&gt; also means that they&#039;re willing to communicate, which is an essential trait to a strong marriage.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Libra.&lt;/strong&gt; To a Libra, fair and balanced is more than just a slogan, it&#039;s a way of life. Each member of the Libra&#039;s family deserves to be treated with love and respect, and they will make sure that happens. However, it&#039;s that same drive for fairness that might make them unwilling to get into confrontations, thus letting arguments bubble and boil for far too long.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Leo.&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, a Leo is well-known for being stubborn and strong-willed, but what makes a Leo a strong partner are two specific traits - loyalty and generosity. Truly a giving sign, they will do anything for their partner, and they thrive on showing their loved ones how much they care. Loyal to a fault, since they have a tendency to take it really personally when others abuse their trust, this sign is in it for the long haul.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Cancer.&lt;/strong&gt; Empathetic and loyal, Cancer signs are practically made for marriage. They care deeply about their home and everyone in it, so they&#039;re unafraid to put the work into a relationship. Yet, the only thing keeping Cancer from being the best suited for marriage is their ability to become overly moody and manipulative. It&#039;s because they care so deeply that they sometimes let those emotions get in the way of what they should actually do to mend relationships.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Taurus.&lt;/strong&gt; Hands down the most reliable sign, those lucky enough to be married to a Taurus are destined for a long and happy life. If matched with the right sign, they will be passionate and loving, favoring intimate relationships that are established on trust and sensual desires. However, this sign is not right for everyone and can become very complicated and stubborn.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Pisces.&lt;/strong&gt; Like their fish counterpart, people born under the Pisces sign know how to go with the flow. This flexibility, along with their dependability, compassion, and romantic leanings, make for a great marriage. Pisces &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/I-Dont-Want-Have-Sex-My-Husband-After-Having-Kids-44505142&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;make amazing partners&lt;/a&gt; who, once committed, are connected for life. Selfless and always willing to help others, the biggest risk of divorce for this sign is the tendency to let people take advantage of their good nature.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n</description>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Astrology\">Astrology</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Love\">Love</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Relationships\">Relationships</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Divorce\">Divorce</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Marriage\">Marriage</category>\n <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 08:40:05 -0800</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Laurel Niedospial</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">44526224</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>Zodiac Signs Most Likely to Divorce</search_title>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title>5 Common Myths About Infidelity, Debunked</title>\n <link>https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Myths-About-Cheating-44564507</link>\n <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Myths-About-Cheating-44564507&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;160&quot; height=&quot;104&quot; src=&quot;https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/e5r2hbKY4vmKE-OuGIU5axCN3k8/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/02/07/193/n/40952353/tmp_ZVVeWf_aedb08d35b057c5b_StockSnap_5KKG0RMWOA.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whether you&#039;ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Signs-Your-Marriage-Can-Still-Saved-44318265&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;been married for years&lt;/a&gt;, are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/What-Marriage-Really-Like-Essay-44503764&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;newlyweds&lt;/a&gt;, never want to get married, or just started dating, one thing that weighs heavily on most couples is the fear of infidelity. Who does it? Why do they do it? When does it happen? How do people get caught? How do they get away with it? And what is it about infidelity that has us all a bit obsessed? Maybe it&#039;s because many of us have been cheated on. Or maybe it&#039;s because it&#039;s our biggest fear - someone stealing away &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Things-I-Want-My-Husband-Know-44505710&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the person we love the most&lt;/a&gt;. But as much as people think they know all there is to know about infidelity (&quot;once a cheater, always a cheater&quot;), there are a lot of myths about it that only those who have been there know aren&#039;t true.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;related-stories&quot;&gt;Related&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/How-Start-Dating-After-Divorce-44433288&quot;&gt;10 Real Fears About Love After Divorce&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;1. It&#039;s Not Always the Man&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When people hear about cheating in a heterosexual relationship, many automatically assume the man did it, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/love/Why-Do-Women-Cheat-43617036&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;women are at fault, too&lt;/a&gt;. No matter what kind of relationship you&#039;re in, &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; can cheat. The reasons behind the cheating might be different for men and women, but there is no innocent party.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;2. It Doesn&#039;t Have to End the Relationship&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cheating is one of the biggest reasons to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Things-Divorced-People-Experience-44354462&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;end a relationship or marriage&lt;/a&gt;, but it doesn&#039;t have to be if the two people involved are willing to work through their issues. Many people can forgive, forget, and have a better future together, but it depends on the individuals. Is the cheater sorry? Are they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Texting-Cheating-44504679&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;willing to be honest about the situation&lt;/a&gt;? Does the person who cheated want to start fresh? Does their partner want to give it another shot? These are all questions you must be able to answer if you want to move forward together.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;3. Someone Else May Not Have Started the Affair&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While it might hurt a little less to envision someone pursuing your partner, you have to face the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Cheating-Tendencies-According-Zodiac-Signs-44512767&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the person who cheated&lt;/a&gt; has to be in a place mentally to decide to cheat. While nobody should willfully get involved with someone who is in a committed, monogamous relationship, the person who decides to cheat is ultimately to blame. They&#039;re an adult, and they make their own choices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;4. It Doesn&#039;t Mean the Cheater Is Confident&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When a person cheats, they typically have needs that aren&#039;t being met in their current relationship. While it&#039;s easy to think of cheaters as people who are full of themselves and think they can do anything, infidelity almost always comes from a place of insecurity, which means the person who is cheating is lacking in self-confidence. Yes, you can call a cheater cocky, but cocky doesn&#039;t mean self-fulfilled or strong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;5. It Doesn&#039;t Mean the Person Your Partner Cheated With Is Evil&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The person your partner cheated on you with can indeed be awful, but they&#039;re also probably insecure and needy. This person probably wants to be loved like you do, but because they&#039;re not strong and happy on the inside, they make choices from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Stress-Relief-Gifts-44307947&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lack of self-love&lt;/a&gt;. You don&#039;t need to forgive this person, but just know they might not be as evil as they seem at first glance. And since you want to put yourself and your happiness first, holding onto anger will never serve you well in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Love\">Love</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Relationships\">Relationships</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Cheating\">Cheating</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Divorce\">Divorce</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Marriage\">Marriage</category>\n <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 08:40:04 -0800</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Laura Lifshitz</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">44564507</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>Myths About Cheating</search_title>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title>Eminem&#039;s Depressing Music Video For &quot;River&quot; Would Make Even Cupid Stop Believing in Love</title>\n <link>https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Eminem-Ed-Sheeran-River-Music-Video-44578657</link>\n <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Eminem-Ed-Sheeran-River-Music-Video-44578657&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;160&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; src=&quot;https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/6fBkxkshDvCCMigi9KkB5Qjeq_k/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/02/14/741/n/1922283/cb8df7695a846829bf5d03.16210586_edit_img_image_44578657_1518568511.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;728&quot; height=&quot;410&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wfWIs2gFTAM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;\nThe day after &lt;a class=&quot;sugar-inline-link&quot; title=&quot;Latest photos and news for Eminem&quot; href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/Eminem&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eminem&lt;/a&gt; shared &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Eminem/status/963142542677172224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a gritty teaser&lt;/a&gt; for his &quot;River&quot; music video with Ed Sheeran, which promised fans an &quot;Unhappy Valentine&#039;s Day,&quot; we have the full-length clip to enjoy.

Besides pushing organs in new and fascinating places, you also typically gain a few pounds to benefit both yourself and your baby.

Since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/When-Can-I-Start-Working-Out-After-Birth-44490358&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;exercise is traditionally forbidden&lt;/a&gt; for at least six weeks after delivery, the successful and popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Whole30&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Whole30 diet&lt;/a&gt;, which involves participants eliminating sugar, alcohol, grains, legumes, soy, and dairy from their diets for 30 days, might be an option.

We Have Good and Bad News&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Producing milk is one of the most important things a mom&#039;s body does, but to create the required supply, an uptick in calories is needed, says lactation consultants at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atlantichealth.org/morristown.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Morristown Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, Mary Jane Swenson, Renee Quinn, Jenny Peterson, Dana Caulkins, and Registered Dietitian Nutritionist Christin Aikey. &quot;Depending on the mom&#039;s fat stores and diet, during lactation, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/How-Many-Calories-Does-Breastfeeding-Burn-44265869&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;additional 400 calories per day is recommended&lt;/a&gt; to meet the caloric needs of producing about one liter of breast milk per day during the first six months of lactation,&quot; they told POPSUGAR. &quot;A woman may get enough calories to sufficiently produce milk, however if she is eliminating foods due to diet recommendations and/or her own personal preferences, she may not meet her calorie goals for increasing milk production, while another may not have trouble.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Besides the potential to cause problems with supply, the Whole30 diet also might not give &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Can-You-Breastfeed-NICU-44475391&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a breastfeeding mom&lt;/a&gt; everything she needs. &quot;Although aiming to promote a diet of whole, real foods, it&#039;s a restrictive diet that can lead to nutritional gaps (potentially calcium, vitamin d, and some B vitamins found in enriched whole grains) for breastfeeding women,&quot; they continued. &quot;Continuing a prenatal vitamin may help bridge some gaps, but again, food groups are eliminated so the diet is not balanced.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;related-stories&quot;&gt;Related&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/How-Much-Water-Should-You-Drink-While-Breastfeeding-44487160&quot;&gt;If You&#039;re Breastfeeding, You Might Need to Drink a Lot More Water Than You Think&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The risk, it seems, doesn&#039;t outweigh the rewards. &quot;Lactation, in addition to the demands of new motherhood, may not be the best time to try to &#039;reset&#039; their bodies,&quot; they warn. Instead of focusing on trendy diets, the recommendation is to take a more holistic approach to health. &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Foods-Avoid-While-Nursing-44312624&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eating a healthy, balanced diet&lt;/a&gt; with foods from a wide variety of all the food groups in moderation will provide a mother with what is needed to produce quality breast milk for her baby.

Brother and sister Alex and Maia Shibutani are probably the cutest Team USA duo. They&#039;ll be competing for a gold medal in ice dancing in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Winter-Olympics-2018-Details-44259749&quot; &gt;Pyeongchang, South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, but before you see their sparkly outfits and amazing stunts on the ice, here are seven things you need to know about them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;They Have Been Skating Together For 14 Years&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Twenty-six-year-old Alex began skating at age 7 and 23-year-old Maia first put on her skates at age 4. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/Bb4nupajqCE/?taken-by=alexshibutani&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The duo&#039;s first competition together was at Lake Placid in 2004&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/Bb7Fzflllg-/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;they did the cha-cha&lt;/a&gt; just a few months after first pairing up as an ice dancing couple. At the Boston US Open in the same year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BZm0JEuj580/?taken-by=alexshibutani&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Maia was so short, she couldn&#039;t see above the boards around the rink&lt;/a&gt;. They competed in the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, coming in 9th place. This time they are going for the gold. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Their Nickname Is ShibSibs&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The three-time world medalist brother-sister team is known throughout the skating world as the ShibSibs, a combination of their last name and the word siblings. They have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/shibsibs/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a joint Instagram account under that nickname&lt;/a&gt;, but also have their own solo social media, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/maiashibutani/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@maiashibutani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/alexshibutani/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@alexshibutani&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-permalink=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BVGMZKCAvfk/&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;8&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot; class=&quot;insta-preview-v1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=&#039;  line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%; background:url(&quot;https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/58bd98ae1029cffe9c07de106a5713ec/5B12E7F4/t51.2885-15/e35/18949905_464216813927706_3865374032715055104_n.jpg&quot;); background-size:contain;&#039;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BVGMZKCAvfk/&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A post shared by Maia Shibutani, Alex Shibutani (@shibsibs)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2017-06-08T23:19:15+00:00&quot;&gt;Jun 8, 2017 at 4:19pm PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;They Were Inspired by Michelle Kwan&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The first Olympics they watched were the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.

After asking her daughter to help clean up her bath toys, Leah stepped our of the room for all of two seconds to help her son get his pajamas on. She told POPSUGAR that there&#039;s nothing more unsettling than quiet kids, so it&#039;s no surprise she went into a full-blown panic when she didn&#039;t hear the usual &quot;I OK Momma&quot; from her toddler when she asked how she was doing. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;When she suddenly stopped singing and didn&#039;t respond to that question, my heart dropped a little. The moments that followed seemed like they were in slow motion and lasted forever - although I&#039;m sure it was only the matter of seconds. I know I got up quickly and peeked around the door into the bathroom. My daughter&#039;s back was to me and her arms were extended . . . the second I laid eyes on her I knew something was wrong. I&#039;m not sure when the panic set in because I really wasn&#039;t even sure what exactly was wrong at first - but the panic most definitely set in,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;related-stories&quot;&gt;Related&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Blake-Lively-Ryan-Reynolds-Infant-CPR-Post-43687533&quot;&gt;Blake Lively&#039;s Powerful Message to 1 Mom About Her Infant&#039;s Unexpected Death&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once Leah finally got to the bathtub, she was faced with any parent&#039;s worst nightmare: her daughter was choking on a small toy. Leah realized she needed help fast, and unfortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Dad-Saves-Daughter-Who-Almost-Drowned-CPR-43605307&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;her CPR skills were rusty at best&lt;/a&gt; since she hadn&#039;t attended a training session since her son was born eight years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;pullquote-container&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#039;t just take a class and check it off your list. Review the techniques often, go online, and refresh your memory often.&quot; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Leah&#039;s neighbor, Mrs. T, is a daycare provider and knew exactly how to respond when the panicked mother came barreling up the steps with her daughter in her arms. After a few agonizing seconds, her toddler&#039;s airway was totally clear, and Leah could breath easy again. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;The toy that had lodged itself in her throat had absolutely NO BUSINESS coming out. I&#039;m not even sure how it got lodged in her throat to begin with because it seemed too large to do so,&quot; she said, adding that, &quot;She has never been one to put toys in her mouth and at 3-and-a-half she knows better now.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Leah&#039;s choking scare was enough for her to seriously get up-to-date on her CPR certification, and now she&#039;s urging other parents to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think it&#039;s important that parents really become comfortable with CPR and choking relief techniques,&quot; said Leah. &quot;Don&#039;t just take a class and check it off your list. Review the techniques often, go online, and refresh your memory often. Copy your certification book pictures/instructions and keep them up on the refrigerator. There is something about seeing your child turn white and blue that has the great potential to mess with your reactions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;She also says that even if you haven&#039;t been exactly good about getting recertified every few years, it&#039;s nothing to be embarrassed about. &quot;I&#039;ve had an overwhelming response from parents who have been in similar scary situations with their children, and sadly, some that did not turn out as great as mine. Don&#039;t be too embarrassed to ask questions and ask to review techniques until you&#039;re comfortable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Health and Safety\">Health and Safety</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Parenting News\">Parenting News</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Little Kids\">Little Kids</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Parenting\">Parenting</category>\n <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 08:35:09 -0800</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Murphy Moroney</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">44583491</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>Why Parents Need to Be CPR Certified</search_title>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title>Real Techniques Just Launched Glittery New Brushes and, Well, There Goes Our Money</title>\n <link>https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Real-Techniques-Brush-Crush-Collection-44500968</link>\n <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Real-Techniques-Brush-Crush-Collection-44500968&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;160&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; src=&quot;https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/PA7b9pBZwTRpeaJTf9ejy4IGmlM/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/01/15/941/n/1922153/b0cf439e5a5d1ed5035af7.37440639_edit_img_cover_file_44500968_1516051371.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/realtechniques/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Real Techniques&lt;/a&gt; is kicking 2018 off with a glittery, shimmery, holographic bang - and we&#039;re not complaining.

As an editor, I&#039;m always searching for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/Best-Cocktail-Dresses-2018-44558408&quot; &gt;the coolest products readers should know about&lt;/a&gt;. As we transition from Winter to Spring, I&#039;m loving pastel blazers, printed dresses, kitten heels, and cat-eye sunglasses. But fashion isn&#039;t the only thing I shop for - beauty releases and home decor are also on my radar. If you have ever been curious about what shopping editors are buying for themselves, I&#039;ll let you see for yourself. I curated a roundup of the buzziest must haves I&#039;m loving this week.

Instead of answering questions about how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Jamie-Foxx-Katie-Holmes-Valentine-Day-2018-44593510&quot;&gt;he spent Valentine&#039;s Day playing basketball with the former &lt;strong&gt;Dawson&#039;s Creek&lt;/strong&gt; actress&lt;/a&gt;, the Oscar winner paused before taking off his headphones and abruptly walking off, effectively ending the interview. &quot;Did we lose him?&quot; Michael can be heard asking in the background of in the clip. Luckily, Jamie did stick around to play against Justin Bieber in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game. Maybe next time keep the questions - on a sports-related show - related to sports?

She can also brace her arms against a wall to help with thrusting,&quot; Hall said. You&#039;ll orgasmically burn those calories together!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The Head Game&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This position requires some serious core strength, but get ready, it&#039;s worth it. &quot;A Kama Sutra position, start by lying flat on your back,&quot; explained Bethany Ricciardi, one of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tootimid.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TooTimid&lt;/a&gt;&#039;s &lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/span&gt; experts. This challenging position then has you prop your lower back up and use your hands to support your lower back while lifting your legs and backside way, way, way up so that they are as perpendicular to the ground as you can get them. &quot;You might feel like you&#039;re balancing on your shoulders, that&#039;s how up you want to go! Let your man kneel before you, grab your angles, and bring his knees close in, toward your shoulders. Ask him to hold your hips to help keep you both steady! Definitely don&#039;t be afraid to also hold his thighs for leverage; you&#039;re going to be using a lot of strength and balance here. But enjoy the upside-down fun!&quot; Ricciardi said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;related-stories&quot;&gt;Related&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Best-Sex-Positions-Relieve-Stress-44330290&quot;&gt;Say Goodbye to Stress and Hello to Bliss With These Pleasure-Inducing Sex Positions&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt; Throne&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is when the guy takes a seat on the edge of the bed and the woman takes a seat on his lap facing away from him (ideally with a table or chair within arm&#039;s reach for stabilizing). &quot;When penetration starts, it&#039;s really just quad and core work that&#039;s controlling the movement on the woman&#039;s part; the guy is motionless,&quot; explained &lt;a href=&quot;http://valerieaugust.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Valerie August&lt;/a&gt;, a UK-based escort and dominatrix. As long as the mattress isn&#039;t too hard or high, the woman can get a kind of bounce going if she picks up speed, which is intense on the muscles but creates better stimulation (otherwise lots of slow insertions and withdrawals). &quot;If the mattress poses an issue, you can modify the whole thing by reverting to reverse cowgirl, but with knees up and feet on the mattress - like a deep squat. Again ideally, you want a hand on a bedpost, and then thrusting is all quads, and a bit faster to activate the bouncier, shallower thrusts is key for nicer-feeling stimulation,&quot; August said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;related-stories&quot;&gt;Related&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/moms/Best-Sex-Positions-Get-Pregnant-43956208&quot;&gt;Try These Sex Positions If You Want a Kid Running Around the House ASAP&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt; The Bridge&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt; She begins on her back, with him on his knees between her legs. &quot;She lifts up into a backbend, which he can help support by holding her upper thighs or buttocks. Even the best personal trainer can&#039;t get you burning this many calories, and it&#039;ll be far more fun. But if it gets to be too much, she can lower herself onto her elbows,&quot; Hall said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt; Downward Dog&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With both people standing, she lowers herself into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Downward-Facing-Dog-2671016&quot;&gt;Downward Dog position&lt;/a&gt;, hands flat on the floor. &quot;She gets on her toes and rocks back and forth on her feet while thrusting with her major leg muscle groups. She can also raise one leg behind her, wrapping it around his waist area, which he helps support. He&#039;ll use his legs to help thrust and keep his back tight while supporting her weight. This balancing act will keep them both in shape and glowing with satisfaction!&quot; Hall said. (This is best done standing on the floor, as we know people who have broken beds doing it!)&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/NSFW\">NSFW</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Sexual Health\">Sexual Health</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Healthy Living\">Healthy Living</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Women&#039;s Health\">Women&#039;s Health</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Calories Burned\">Calories Burned</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Sex\">Sex</category>\n <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 08:30:27 -0800</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Aly Walansky</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">44358539</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>Sex Positions That Burn the Most Calories</search_title>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title>Exercises Your Trainer Doesn&#039;t Want You to Do</title>\n <link>https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Exercises-Trainers-Dont-Like-43200628</link>\n <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Exercises-Trainers-Dont-Like-43200628&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;160&quot; height=&quot;107&quot; src=&quot;https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/tfhp5txfL0Q8BVO5Z2QROggfi2U/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2017/02/21/064/n/40863086/6fc18aee58acdc24c7ac94.75897925_edit_img_cover_file_43200628_1487635084.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are literally hundreds of exercises you can do in the gym or at home.

We spoke with certified personal trainer Heather Neff and got her list of the top three moves she has her clients avoid and what to do instead. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;related-stories&quot;&gt;Related&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/How-Perform-Exercise-Rep-43009557&quot;&gt;The 1-Second Hack That Will Improve Any and Every Exercise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n</description>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Beginner Fitness Tips\">Beginner Fitness Tips</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Popsugar Interviews\">Popsugar Interviews</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Workouts\">Workouts</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Strength Training\">Strength Training</category>\n <has-gallery></has-gallery>\n <pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 08:30:24 -0800</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Michael De Medeiros</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">43200628</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>Exercises Trainers Don&#039;t Like</search_title>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title>You Should Recognize the Figure Skating Commentators - They ARE Former Olympians</title>\n <link>https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Who-Olympics-Figure-Skating-Commentators-44571226</link>\n <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Who-Olympics-Figure-Skating-Commentators-44571226&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;160&quot; height=&quot;159&quot; src=&quot;https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/nh8bSMAyhjS-VRxu1T2z3myuCrw/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/02/09/085/n/43466149/cc7613705a7e44a6d3cfc0.68774718_edit_img_image_44571226_1518223583_15182245425676.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-permalink=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BF-msr_N6Dy/&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;8&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot; class=&quot;insta-preview-v1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=&#039;  line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%; background:url(&quot;https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/83dbb19d0db87745ecb3e924b20d193c/5B0851FC/t51.2885-15/e35/13259038_223083108078209_1339768122_n.jpg&quot;); background-size:contain;&#039;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BF-msr_N6Dy/&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A post shared by TARA &amp;amp; JOHNNY (@taraandjohnny)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-05-29T04:44:17+00:00&quot;&gt;May 28, 2016 at 9:44pm PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\nThe figure skating commentators at this year&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Winter-Olympics-Sports-44271929&quot; &gt;Winter Olympics at Pyeongchang&lt;/a&gt;, South Korea, are best friends (and former Olympians) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Who-Tara-Lipinski-44570657&quot; &gt;Tara Lipinski&lt;/a&gt; and Johnny Weir. Both figure skaters have competed for the gold in the past. Tara &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Who-Tara-Lipinski-44570657&quot; &gt;won a gold medal at the 1998 Olympics in Japan&lt;/a&gt;, while Johnny famously paid homage to his idol in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Johnny-Weir-Skating-Lady-Gaga-Poker-Face-44569827&quot; &gt;2010 routine to Lady Gaga&#039;s &quot;Poker Face&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; Though neither are performing this year, their sassy rinkside commentary has already been a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/news/Reactions-Johnny-Weir-Tara-Lipinski-2018-Olympics-44570277&quot; &gt;much-discussed highlight&lt;/a&gt; of the Olympic Games.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Their long friendship is well-documented (and quite evident when watching their banter live); they even share a joint Instagram account (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/taraandjohnny/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@taraandjohnny&lt;/a&gt;). Their witty rapport has been well-honed over the years, as the fabulous duo have done everything from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/photo-gallery/22899519/image/37369291/Tara-Lipinski-Johnny-Weir-both-had-fun-extravagant&quot; &gt;attending the Kentucky Derby&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/photo-gallery/37351267/image/37351290/Tara-Lipinski-Johnny-Weir&quot; &gt;visiting the White House together&lt;/a&gt;.

Long-term ingestion of zinc can lower your good cholesterol HDL, decrease immunity, and lower your copper levels,&quot; said South Florida cardiologist Adam Splaver, MD, NanoHealth Associates.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Many people associate zinc with a healthy immune system, but it also works to support your nervous system. &quot;I recommend it for people with drained brains because it acts as a cofactor - helping your body to manufacture the stress-relieving neurotransmitters GABA and serotonin from the amino acids in your diet,&quot; said renowned psychotherapist and author of &lt;a href=&quot;http://drmikedow.com/books/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heal Your Drained Brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Mike Dow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;related-stories&quot;&gt;Related&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Can-You-Take-Too-Much-B12-44551442&quot;&gt;You Should Actually Be More Worried About Getting Too Little Vitamin B12 Than Too Much&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Too much of a good thing becomes a bad thing, and it does happen. &quot;Zinc toxicity is relatively rare and usually manifests first with nausea and or vomiting and taste changes (especially when using zinc lozenges) and then - to a lesser extent - fatigue and lethargy,&quot; said Joel Totoro, RD, who works with Thorne Research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The negative implications of higher-than-recommended zinc intakes are the result of zinc&#039;s impact on copper levels. &quot;Both zinc and copper activate a cell protein in the intestines that binds to both metal ions but has a much higher preference for copper,&quot; Totoro said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Excess zinc causes the body to remove even more copper, which can result in a copper deficiency over time. &quot;Osteoporosis and impaired growth have been linked to a copper deficiency, most commonly in children,&quot; Totoro said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;related-stories&quot;&gt;Related&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/What-Does-Vitamin-D-Do-44512743&quot;&gt;This Is the Supplement I Simply Can&#039;t Live Without During the Winter&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Zinc recommendations are split into two categories: &quot;Low dose for maintenance and to meet daily needs and high-dose protocols to correct a deficiency. Athletes and those with high sweat rates and vegan/vegetarians are at a higher risk for deficiency,&quot; said Totoro, who explained that zinc is one of the minerals that is lost in sweat, so the more you sweat, the more zinc you need. Totoro made the following dosage recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-Dose Recommendations:&lt;/strong&gt; 8 mg/day for women, 10-12 mg/day for pregnant women, 14-15 mg/day for men&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-Dose Recommendations:&lt;/strong&gt; 25-40 mg/day&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Tolerable Upper Limit (TUL):&lt;/strong&gt; 40 mg/day&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Short-term doses (two to three months) of 100 mg/day have been considered safe but should only be used under medical supervision to correct a deficiency, and attention should be paid to copper status.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;related-stories&quot;&gt;Related&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Best-Vitamins-44471452&quot;&gt;8 Top-Rated Vitamins That Will Give You a Boost in 2018 - All From Amazon&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Supplemental zinc comes in many forms, with varying zinc concentrations. Zinc picolinate is considered the most bioavailable, followed by zinc gluconate and zinc citrate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you are taking a multivitamin, check the ingredients. &quot;You probably have zinc in the vitamin. And this is one vitamin where too much is not a good thing,&quot; Dr. Splaver said.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Healthy Living\">Healthy Living</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Women&#039;s Health\">Women&#039;s Health</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Vitamins\">Vitamins</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Supplements\">Supplements</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Cold and Flu\">Cold and Flu</category>\n <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 08:30:26 -0800</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Aly Walansky</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">44548152</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>What Happens If You Take Too Much Zinc?</search_title>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title>Meghan Markle&#039;s Jewelry Trick Is So Ingenious, You&#039;ll Want to Try It For Yourself</title>\n <link>https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/Meghan-Markle-Rings-44583030</link>\n <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/Meghan-Markle-Rings-44583030&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;107&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; src=&quot;https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/YzbYwd65DniF4WP_4giVVmPPFcg/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/02/14/485/n/1922564/1d36b1705a8411e2a0c291.36040715_edit_img_cover_file_15895530_1518604192.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When Meghan Markle stepped out for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Prince-Harry-Meghan-Markle-Edinburgh-February-2018-44578421&quot;&gt;her first official visit to Scotland&lt;/a&gt; with Prince Harry, all eyes were on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/Meghan-Markle-Green-Strathberry-Crossbody-Bag-44578459&quot;&gt;her cute, yet rule-breaking crossbody bag&lt;/a&gt;. But while we loved her bottle green purse, what truly deserves your attention is her choice of jewelry. For the occasion, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/Meghan-Markle-Wedding-Dress-Designer-44513260&quot;&gt;royal bride-to-be&lt;/a&gt; wore five dainty little rings on her right hand, mixing some high-end pieces with more affordable options for a truly perfect look. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, this trick isn&#039;t new. Meghan is known for rocking both designer diamonds and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/Meghan-Markle-Bracelets-44445894&quot;&gt;inexpensive bracelets&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/Meghan-Markle-Jewelry-44232098&quot;&gt;her jewelry box&lt;/a&gt; is full of classic, grown-up pieces and delicate boho trinkets. This time around, though, she made sure her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/Delicate-Gold-Jewelry-37435254&quot;&gt;delicate gold jewelry&lt;/a&gt; perfectly matched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/Meghan-Markle-Engagement-Ring-44301791&quot;&gt;her stunning engagement ring&lt;/a&gt;, and we&#039;re absolutely loving the result.
