Mr. McCaffery is responsible for the firm\u2019s strategic client mandates for the firm\u2019s investment division with more than \u00a3250 billion ($350 billion) in assets.</p>\n<p>Monaco-based Altana Wealth, headed by former Tudor Capital manager Lee Robinson, has been recommending clients switch from portfolios betting on rising prices to portfolios betting on both rising and falling prices since before last week\u2019s market slump.</p>\n<p>The effects of QE, and the extent to which it has propped up markets and economic growth, are still unclear. Even less understood is what happens when QE is withdrawn \u2013 a process termed QT, or quantitative tightening.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fact that QE is turning to QT this year, and you\u2019re going from an absolute peak of QE in the summer of 2017 to this year when it looks like overall QT, to me that warrants caution,\u201d said Mr. Robinson, who previously co-founded hedge fund Trafalgar.</p>\n<p>If QE has \u201ctaken so much potential future demand from the future, at some point you\u2019re going to pay a price for that,\u201d said Aberdeen\u2019s Mr. McCaffery. \u201cThat price is going to be that [economic] growth is potentially going to come to a shuddering halt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Some executives believe the 8% drop in the Dow Jones since its Jan. 26 record high, including the slump of Feb. 5, could mark a fundamental change in the market environment.</p>\n<p>Sandy Rattray, chief investment officer at Man Group, the world\u2019s biggest listed hedge fund firm, and co-inventor of the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), said\u00a0\u201cit certainly feels as though the long period of low volatility may well have come to an end.\u201d</p>\n<p>The ECB has halved the pace of its bond purchases as of January, with the program now set to run through September.

That auction came a day after a $26 billion offering of three-year notes was sold at 2.28%, the highest yield since May 2007.</p>\n<p>Those higher yields are likely to be fairly costly for the U.S. Nine years of bond yields near record lows mean the U.S. government is paying virtually the same in interest costs on $20.5 trillion of debt as it paid in 2008 on about $10.6 trillion. Should bond yields continue to rise, so will the cost of funding that debt. This is of particular importance to the U.S., which is increasing the amount it borrows at its bond auctions this year as it funds a $1.5 trillion tax cut.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday,\u00a0Germany had to pay\u00a0\u200b0.69%\u00a0to borrow at\u00a010 years\u200b, more\u200b\u00a0than at any other time since 2015.</p>\n<p>In 2016, investors had to pay Germany to borrow money for\u00a010 years.\u00a0The 10-year German bond is a key\u00a0benchmark for Europe, and influences funding costs across the region.</p>\n<p>In other recent examples of higher European government funding costs, Austria sold 10-year bonds\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0at an average yield of 0.861%, up from 0.788% in January. Last week, France sold 10-year bonds at an average yield of 0.98%, up from 0.79% at the beginning of January.</p>\n<p>At the end of January,\u00a0Italy sold a new 10-year bond at a yield of 2.06%, paying a higher return to investors than the 1.86% it paid before the end of 2017. Italy\u2019s 10-year funding costs were above 2% in the first nine months of September.</p>\n<p>Governments are paying more as yields on their outstanding issues rise,\u00a0even if\u00a0to levels that remain extremely low on a historical basis.</p>\n<p>Yields on the 10-year benchmark German bond have risen to 0.67% from 0.46% at the beginning of the year and 0.30% in mid-December, according to Tradeweb data.\u00a0Yields on the U.S. 10-year have risen to 2.795%\u00a0Wednesday from 2.06% in September.</p>\n<p>When equity markets fell steeply on Monday, bond yields once again fell as investors looked for safe places to put their money. But\u00a0on Wednesday, they were mainly higher.</p>\n<p>This reflects mounting expectations that the long period of central bank stimulus is nearing its end on the back of accelerating economic growth.\u00a0On Wednesday, the European Union\u00a0raised its <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/eurozone-set-for-pickup-in-economic-growth-1518003272\">forecast for the eurozone\u2019s growth</a> to 2.3% in 2018 from its previous forecast of 2.1%, and to 2% in 2019 from 1.9% previously.</p>\n<p>\u201cHigher funding costs is one of the side effects of the European Central Bank\u2019s policy normalization,\u201d said Antoine Bouvet, rates strategist at Mizuho.</p>\n<p>That will have consequences. Not just for companies, whose bonds are priced off sovereign debt, but for governments themselves.</p>\n<p>For Germany, it is \u201cmanageable\u201d to pay 0.70% on a 10-year bond, said Mr. Bouvet. But for other countries, like Italy, rising funding costs can have a meaningful impact, he says.</p>\n<p>While its economy is now growing, Italy has suffered years of lackluster growth. The country\u2019s banks have struggled with nonperforming loans and the government has one of the highest debt burdens in Europe. In 2017, Italy had a debt-to-GDP ratio of 132.1%, against an average of\u00a083.5% across the rest of Europe.</p>\n<p>To be sure, any rise of in borrowing costs for governments is coming at a time when economic growth is accelerating, which will bring in\u00a0higher tax revenues.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/02/07/rising-yields-are-rocking-stocks-but-what-about-issuers/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<media:group><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-XA223_EUROPE_C_20180116150855.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-XA223_EUROPE_D_20180116150855.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-XA223_EUROPE_E_20180116150855.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-XA223_EUROPE_G_20180116150855.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-XA223_EUROPE_P_20180116150855.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-XA223_EUROPE_J_20180116150855.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-XA223_EUROPE_M_20180116150855.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-XA223_EUROPE_ER_20180116150855.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-XA223_EUROPE_GR_20180116150855.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /></media:group>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>As Yields Rise, Germany Has to Pay to Borrow Again</title>\n\t\t<link>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/01/31/as-yields-rise-germany-has-to-pay-to-borrow-again/?mod=WSJ_moneybeat_blog</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/01/31/as-yields-rise-germany-has-to-pay-to-borrow-again/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2018 13:19:56 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Emese Bartha]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[bonds]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Europe]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[ECB]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Germany]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/?p=66187</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Germany had to pay to borrow money for five years for the first time since 2015, as higher yields begin to raise financing costs for Europe\u2019s largest economy.]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>\n<div style=\"color: #222222\">\n<p>For the first time since 2015, Germany has actually had to pay to borrow money for five years. That\u2019s as investors sell bonds around the world, pushing up yields and raising financing costs for Europe\u2019s largest economy.</p>\n<p>The German Finance Agency sold \u20ac3.20 billion ($3.97 billion) of new debt at an average yield of 0.08%\u00a0on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Since September 2015, five-year German bonds have been sold with a negative yield, meaning that investors buying and holding new bonds would be paying to lend the country money.\u00a0Also this month, Germany paid an average yield of 0.54% in a sale of 10-year bonds, the highest for that maturity since July 2017.</p>\n<p>Yields on government bonds have climbed since the start of the year.</p>\n<p>Earlier this week, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note settled at 2.695%, its highest closing level since April 22, 2014. Germany\u2019s five-year bond yield touched positive territory for the first time since late 2015. Yields have also been rising for the government bonds of France, Italy, the U.K. and Japan.</p>\n<p>Investors are selling bonds, spurred by signs of growth and increasing expectations\u00a0of a pickup in inflation. Economic expansion can push investors into riskier assets while inflation poses a threat to the value of government bonds because it erodes the purchasing power of their fixed payments.\u00a0In Europe, faster growth is leading investors to anticipate tighter monetary policy from the European Central Bank.</p>\n<p>Investors are pricing in an earlier and faster-than-expected round of interest-rate rises, said\u00a0Peter Chatwell, head of EMEA rates strategy at Mizuho.</p>\n<p>Some yields in Europe and Japan had plummeted into negative territory as investors piled into government debt in the face of tepid growth, low inflation and high uncertainty, and as central banks cut rates into negative territory.</p>\n<p>Around $10 trillion of the JPM Global Government Bond Index was negative yielding around the middle of 2016. That had fallen to around $6.2 trillion as of Jan. 12.</p>\n<p><em>\u2013Mike Bird contributed to this article.</em></p>\n</div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/01/31/as-yields-rise-germany-has-to-pay-to-borrow-again/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>How the ECB Moved the Euro, and What Happens Next</title>\n\t\t<link>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/01/25/how-the-ecb-moved-the-euro-and-what-happens-next/?mod=WSJ_moneybeat_blog</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/01/25/how-the-ecb-moved-the-euro-and-what-happens-next/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2018 18:47:03 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Joe Wallace]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Central Banks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Europe]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Euro]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[European Central Bank]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Inflation]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Mario Draghi]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[monetary stimulus]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/?p=66057</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Here\u2019s how experts are responding to the latest news out of the European Central Bank.]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beyond a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/ecb-keeps-policy-unchanged-despite-divisions-1516884821\">slap on the wrist</a> for U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Thursday\u2019s policy announcement by the European Central Bank was an uneventful affair. All three main interest rates were unchanged from their all-time lows, and President Mario Draghi did not explain what will happen when the ECB winds down its bond-buying programme, which it could do as early as October.</p>\n<p>Policy remains exceptionally loose, yet the euro jumped as if it had been stung, hopping over $1.25 for the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/euro-breaks-1-25-for-first-time-in-over-three-years-1516892834\">first time since 2014</a> even as Mr. Draghi explained to journalists why the eurozone still requires \u201can ample degree of monetary stimulus.\u201d German government bond yields also jumped. Here\u2019s what observers thought of the decision and of how markets reacted.</p>\n<p>James Athey, senior investment manager at <strong>Aberdeen Standard Investments</strong>, thinks Mr. Draghi sounded more sanguine about inflation rising to its target, and that investors honed in on this. \u201cThe market has taken this as a hawkish message because the ECB\u2019s got a bit more confidence in inflation and Draghi has not rowed back on any of the more bullish prognosis banded around for the region lately,\u201d Mr. Athey said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In contrast, Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at <strong>Pantheon Macroeconomics</strong>, reckons Mr. Draghi could not have done much more to keep the euro bulls in check. \u201cWe think Mr. Draghi sent a clear message today; core inflation is still too low, despite clear signs of a strengthening economy, and investors shouldn\u2019t get too excited about an imminent hawkish shift in ECB policy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Timothy Graf, head of macro strategy for EMEA at <strong>State Street Global Markets</strong>, was also sympathetic but for different reasons. Rather than trying and failing to keep a lid on the common currency, he said, Mr. Draghi \u201chas done enough to keep euro bulls happy in not pushing back too much against the recent strength in the single currency.\u201d</p>\n<p>For clues as to what happens next, Julien-Pierre Nouen, chief economic strategist at <strong>Lazard Fr\u00e8res Gestion</strong>, pointed listeners towards the publication of the ECB\u2019s in-house economic forecasts in March.

Last year trailed only 2013 in terms of total issuance. Such bonds, typically sold by foreign companies\u00a0but issued in the U.S. and denominated in dollars, have made up an increasing share of total U.S. debt issuance recently.</p>\n<p>The rise in Yankee bonds <strong>was</strong> even more pronounced among banks. Financial institutions, including <a href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/UBS\">UBS Group</a>, <a href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/8316.TO\">Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group</a> and <a href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/SAN\">Banco Santander</a>, collectively issued a record $293.5 billion of such bonds last year, according to Dealogic. Such issuance is off to a fast start in 2018 as well.</p>\n<p>The moves are indicative of a number of trends that have propelled corporate bond issuance recently, even after years of a red-hot market. Investors are demanding smaller and smaller premiums over super-safe Treasurys to own corporate bonds, making it more attractive for companies to sell Yankee bonds.</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom a demand perspective and from a technical landscape, you\u2019ve seen two years of continued spread compression,\u201d said Meghan Graper, a managing director in New York at Barclays Plc.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yankee bonds have gained more widespread appeal in recent years. Trading transparency increased after the\u00a0Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\u2019s\u00a0Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine began tracking the trading on the bonds alongside other forms of corporate debt in 2014, bankers say. That has helped\u00a0Yankee bonds to trade closer in line with comparable debt issued by U.S. companies, some say.</p>\n<p>Meantime, investors hunting for yield have been happy to snap up the debt alongside other corporate bonds.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne thing we\u2019ve certainly done over the last year or so is we\u2019ve become more comfortable with some of the European banks,\u201d said Mike Collins, senior portfolio manager at PGIM Fixed Income. He said his firm has bought more Yankee bonds issued by European banks for clients who want U.S.-denominated debt.</p>\n<p>Financial institutions, which issue large amounts of debt to fund their operations,\u00a0typically sell bonds into many markets and make decisions about which market to use based on a variety of factors, including funding costs and the need to diversify issuance. Recently, those factors have been favoring issuance of Yankee bonds, bankers say.</p>\n<p>One factor that has helped make dollar funding more attractive in some cases has been volatility in the market for swapping funding between currencies. At the end of last year, the cost of <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/dollar-funding-costs-in-europe-highest-since-euro-crisis-1513333226\">obtaining dollar funding using other currencies</a> blew out. That\u2019s made it cheaper for some companies to raise funding in the U.S. bond market at particular maturities and swap it back to euros and other currencies.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt reinforced the relative attractiveness of dollars,\u201d Ms. Graper said.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/01/16/foreign-companies-flock-to-the-u-s-bond-market/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<media:group><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-WW774_trader_A_20180108112255.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-WW774_trader_C_20180108112255.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-WW774_trader_D_20180108112255.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-WW774_trader_E_20180108112255.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-WW774_trader_F_20180108112255.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-WW774_trader_G_20180108112255.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-WW774_trader_P_20180108112255.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-WW774_trader_J_20180108112255.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-WW774_trader_M_20180108112255.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-WW774_trader_ER_20180108112255.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-WW774_trader_FR_20180108112255.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-WW774_trader_GR_20180108112255.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-WW774_trader_AM_20180108112255.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /></media:group>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Why the Swiss Central Bank&#8217;s Stock Is Up 150% in a Year</title>\n\t\t<link>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/01/12/swiss-central-banks-profits-and-stock-are-at-records-heres-why/?mod=WSJ_moneybeat_blog</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/01/12/swiss-central-banks-profits-and-stock-are-at-records-heres-why/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2018 13:52:38 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Brian Blackstone]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Central Banks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Europe]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[SNB]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[swiss central bank]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Switzerland]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/?p=65779</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Shares of the Swiss National Bank have been on a tear this week after the central bank said it expected to report a 2017 profit of $55 billion.]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>\n<p>Shares of the Swiss National Bank have been on a tear this week after the central bank said it expected to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/55-billion-profit-for-giant-asset-managerthe-swiss-central-bank-1515485509\">report a 2017 profit of 54 billion francs</a> ($55 billion). SNB shares were up 5% midday Friday at 4,800 francs, a record, capping a three-day surge of 17%.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It raises a fascinating question: why own shares of a central bank? <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-stock-thats-as-safe-as-switzerland-1493199003\">The SNB is a rare breed of central banks</a>\u2014than includes those in Belgium and Japan\u2014that even have listed shares.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the SNB the answer is simple: it is a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/switzerlands-first-world-problem-what-to-do-with-750-billion-1501666483\">very large money manager</a>\u2014which about 760 billion francs worth of foreign stocks and bonds\u2014and gets to print its own money. That\u2019s a recipe for success.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But on the negative side, private shareholders of the SNB don\u2019t have the same kinds of rights and profit potential that investors of other banks and companies have. Other than a tiny dividend, it\u2019s not entirely clear what shareholders actually own.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With that backdrop in mind, here are five things to know about the SNB and its shares.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Why is the SNB making so much money?</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The SNB is trying to weaken the Swiss franc. To do that, it prints new francs and sells them in the markets. What it ends up with in return is a vast pile of foreign stocks and bonds. So long as people still want Swiss francs\u2013and they tend to want them especially in times of global stress\u2013it\u2019s quite a business model. Its efforts to weaken the franc showed some success last year with the euro strengthening about 10% against the franc. That makes the SNB\u2019s investments worth a lot more when converted back into Swiss francs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Has this always been the case?</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No. In 2015 the SNB lose more than 23 billion francs because the franc strengthened after the SNB abandoned a longstanding ceiling it had maintained on the currency\u2019s value. Still, in three of the last four years the SNB has earned big profits.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Who owns its shares?</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are 100,000 shares of the SNB. At the end of 2016, Swiss states, known as Cantons, and Cantonal banks owned a combined 52,000 shares and 75% of voting shares. Private shareholders owned 48,000 shares but only 25% of voting shares. The largest single shareholder at the end of 2016 was a German investor. Just as interesting is who doesn\u2019t own shares: the SNB\u2019s own governing council, according to the last annual report. An alternate board member owned one share.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>How liquid is the stock?</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not very, making it hard to load and unload vast sums. Only around 200 shares trade hands a day, which is one reason why the stock is volatile; it doesn\u2019t take a lot of trades to move the price.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>How about its dividend?</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the biggest reason why the SNB\u2019s sky-high share price is such a headscratcher: the dividend is capped at a puny 15 francs a share, which comes to a yield of about 0.3%. The dividend amount is fixed by law, so it doesn\u2019t matter much money the SNB makes, investors only get a tiny slice of the pie.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/01/12/swiss-central-banks-profits-and-stock-are-at-records-heres-why/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Fund Flows Show Thirst For International Stocks</title>\n\t\t<link>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/12/22/fund-flows-show-thirst-for-international-stocks/?mod=WSJ_moneybeat_blog</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/12/22/fund-flows-show-thirst-for-international-stocks/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2017 14:03:42 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Chris Dieterich]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Asia]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Europe]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Stocks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Equities]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[International stocks]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/?p=65420</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Big-time money is rolling into stock funds that own international equities, a sign that investors expect big things from overseas markets in the new year.]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Big-time money is rolling into stock funds that own international equities, a sign that investors expect big things from overseas markets in the new year.</p>\n<p>Fund investors have favored overseas markets all year as long-dormant economic growth kicked into higher gear in Europe, Japan and across emerging markets. Investors have added $221 billion into international equity funds in 2017, on pace to be the biggest one-year haul since at least 2000, according to the Investment Company Institute. Meantime, some $35 billion has exited U.S. stock mutual and exchange-traded funds in 2017.</p>\n<p>The rotation has intensified this week. The <a href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/EFA\">iShares MSCI EAFE ETF</a> pulled in more than $1 billion in new money Tuesday, the biggest one-day inflow since June, according to FactSet. This ETF owns stocks from major developed markets excluding the U.S. and Canada. At the same time, the <a href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/IEMG\">iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF</a> grabbed $664 million on the same day, the biggest one-day haul since October.</p>\n<p>All told, some $4.1 billion rolled into U.S.-listed international equity ETFs Tuesday, according to ETF.com, which is owned by Cboe Global Markets Inc.</p>\n<p>Big one-day flows can indicate either a swell of small buyers or, more likely, one big investors making a tactical switch to their portfolio, swapping one asset for another, as The Wall Street Journal\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/newsletters?sub=263\">Morning MoneyBeat newsletter</a> noted on Friday.</p>\n<p>It makes sense for U.S. investors to look abroad given that most portfolios heavily favor U.S. stocks. The average 401(k) retirement plan had 55.5% of assets dedicated to U.S. stocks at the end of last year, according to the more than one million 401(k) retirement plans tracked by Alight Solutions.

That compares to a high of 37% during the eurozone crisis in 2012 when Greece defaulted on its debt, and 7.86% in February.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Earlier this year, the Greek government reached a deal with its international creditors over its bailout package, sparking a sharp rally in the bonds. That enabled the country to return to capital markets in July with its first debt sale in three years. The rally has accelerated in recent sessions, with the yield dipping below 5% for the first time in years on Dec. 5.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is finally light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d strategists at Deutsche Bank wrote in a recent special report on Greece, in which they predicted a successful exit from its bailout program next August.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe outlook for 2018 remains positive. But the road to normalization will remain long and difficult,\u201d they added.</p>\n<p>The extra yield investors demand to hold Greek debt over haven German bonds has also compressed this year to 3.6 percentage points from 7.5 percentage points in February. But it still remains far higher than prior to the financial crisis, when it was less than quarter of a percentage point.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/12/15/greek-bond-yields-fall-to-lowest-since-2006/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<media:group><media:content url=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JA262_grscen_A_20150621090726.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JA262_grscen_D_20150621090726.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JA262_grscen_E_20150621090726.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JA262_grscen_G_20150621090726.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JA262_grscen_P_20150621090726.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JA262_grscen_J_20150621090726.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JA262_grscen_M_20150621090726.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JA262_grscen_BR_20150621090726.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JA262_grscen_GR_20150621090726.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /><media:content url=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JA262_grscen_AM_20150621090726.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" /></media:group>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>WSJ City: Markets Cheer Brexit Divorce Deal, Confronting The Brutal Trade-offs, German Coalition Talks Back on</title>\n\t\t<link>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/12/08/wsj-city-sterling-climbs-on-brexit-divorce-deal-confronting-the-brutal-trade-offs-german-coalition-talks-back-on/?mod=WSJ_moneybeat_blog</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/12/08/wsj-city-sterling-climbs-on-brexit-divorce-deal-confronting-the-brutal-trade-offs-german-coalition-talks-back-on/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 08 Dec 2017 08:27:08 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Rebecca Byrne]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Europe]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[City of London]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[WSJCity]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/index.php?p=65088</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Good morning from the WSJ City desks in London.\u00a0Be the first with high-value stories.
