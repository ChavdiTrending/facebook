(THE CANADIAN PRESS/Fred Chartrand)</p></div>\n<p>&#8220;What is a supercluster?&#8221; Navdeep Bains asked, basically, himself.</p>\n<p>We were in a conference room at the Museum of Science and Technology, on a warehouse strip in eastern Ottawa near the highway. The museum is freshly renovated, thanks to money from, if we&#8217;re being honest, Stephen Harper&#8217;s Conservative government, which decided not to relocate the museum from its dispiriting precinct but did set aside some tens of millions to make it spiffy. Which it really is. Spiffy.</p>\n<p>I caught only a glimpse of the museum&#8217;s exhibits on my way to Bains&#8217;s announcement. The permanent exhibition begins with some wooden sleighs from olden times and ends, I feel certain, with a Canadarm. Everything in Ottawa ends with a Canadarm. It is as though Champlain came to shore in 1603 and said, &#8220;Here, with the help of God, we can make things that will one day lift other things in space.&#8221; How his crewmen must have stared at him then.</p>\n<p>But I digress. Navdeep Bains is the minister of ISED, which as everyone in Ottawa knows, stands for Innovation, Science, and something beginning with E. Here I am reporting to you the content of about 60 conversations everyone has had in Ottawa since the bright and personable MP for Mississauga\u2014Malton was rewarded in 2015 for his prowess as a political organizer (the local Liberal nominees, all Bains prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, rolled over the Conservatives and the third-place New Democrats, across the region, like a fleet of Zambonis).</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have a meeting at ISED,&#8221; the conversation begins.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s ISED?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Nav Bains&#8217;s shop. It used to be Industry. You know. Innovation, Science and&#8230;.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Awkward pause.</p>\n<p>But I digress.</p>\n<p>Bains was here to unveil the names of the five winners of funding under the feds&#8217; $950 million supercluster initiative, which was announced in the 2016 budget and is designed to make five superclusters. Since then, the country has been divided into (a) people who haven&#8217;t heard anything about this (b) people who have heard, and are full of snarky theories about what a supercluster is and what someone has to do to win $(950 million/ 5); (c) people who have been frantically organizing to win their $(950 million/ 5).</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/want-better-science-listen-to-scientists/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Want better science? Listen to scientists.</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>On Thursday at the Museum of Science and Technology on the warehouse row near the highway, it became clear, in case there had ever been any doubt, that group (c) comprises a hefty plurality of all Canadians.</p>\n<p>But I digress. &#8220;A supercluster,&#8221; Bains said, answering his own question, &#8220;is a made-in-Canada Silicon Valley that will create tens of thousands of jobs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The minister, in white shirt with rolled-up sleeves and necktie, striding the stage in a passable impression of his boss the Prime Minister, held a microphone and jabbed his free hand forward with each of the last words of his sentence. &#8220;Tens \u2014 of thousands \u2014 of jobs.&#8221; The audience, made up largely of consultants and PR people associated with one or another of the winning bids, clapped heartily, because if nothing else, the supercluster initiative has already been a big part of their own jobs.</p>\n<p>Then Bains announced the winners of the initiative: The <a href=\"http://oceansupercluster.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ocean</a> Supercluster from Atlantic Canada; the <a href=\"https://aisupplychain.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SCALE.AI</a> Supercluster from Quebec; the <a href=\"http://ngmc.qreserve.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Next Generation Manufacturing</a> Supercluster from Ontario; the <a href=\"https://www.proteinindustriescanada.ca/goals.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Protein Industries</a> Supercluster from the Prairies; and the <a href=\"https://bcsupercluster.azurewebsites.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Digital Technology</a> Supercluster from British Columbia.</p>\n<p>Readers are referred to each organization&#8217;s website for information on what they will do. The amount of information you will get from each website varies spectacularly.</p>\n<p>The next-gen manufacturing group from Ontario lists 27 people leading it, although it&#8217;s not clear how many will be involved on anything approaching a full-time basis (one is Meric Gertler, the president of the University of Toronto; another is my onetime colleague Giles Gherson, an Ontario deputy minister, listed as an &#8220;observer&#8221;).</p>\n<p>The AI supply-chain group from, essentially, Montreal (wait! I guess I&#8217;m just guessing about that) is comically gnomic. I could find no name of any actual person or company anywhere on the website. Only a series of Zen riddles. &#8220;Over 120 industrial and enabling institutions, from very large firms to start-ups, have joined forces in this journey,&#8221; the website says helpfully, &#8220;and we have strong momentum.&#8221;</p>\n<p>My early favourite is the protein supercluster from Saskatchewan. Partly because I can already hear you snickering. Partly because the Saskatchewan protein people were much in evidence at Bains&#8217;s announcement. And partly because there is actual information on their website. I&#8217;m in a mood to quote them at some length:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u00a0<em>PIC will move Canada to second place in global agricultural exports and fifth in agri-food exports, equivalent to an additional US$30 billion in exports in today\u2019s distribution of global export shares, and representing nearly 2% of current national GDP. Plant based protein is a $13 billion market opportunity.</em></p>\n<p><em>Outcomes from this cluster will be a new range of plant-derived foods, ingredients and feedstuffs of superior quality, commanding market premiums. As such, the initial focus will be on value-added canola and pulse crop derived products developed by the value chain, including germplasm innovation, crop management technologies, through to advanced processing technologies yielding novel products and further enhancing value through quality, traceability and brand identity.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>The protein people&#8217;s\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.proteinindustriescanada.ca/supporters.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">list of\u00a0</a><a href=\"https://www.proteinindustriescanada.ca/supporters.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">supporters</a> \u00a0has more than 150 names, including the &#8220;City of Lethbridge&#8221;\u2014I have family there; do they know they&#8217;re in on this adventure in germplasm innovation?; &#8220;Balsillie, Jim&#8221;; and something called &#8220;Naturally Splendid Enterprises Canada Ltd.&#8221;, which I could look up but I fear it would spoil the mystery.</p>\n<p>As a few of us policy wonks marvelled at all of this on Twitter, it was popular this morning to note that there was precisely one winning initiative for every major region of the country, except I guess for the territories and, more conspicuously, Alberta, which had two projects among the shortlisted finalists but none among the winners. It was hard not to correlate this outcome with the Trudeau Liberals&#8217; recent shaky performance in Alberta polls. Bains offered no description of the process that led from 50 applicants to nine finalists to five winners, except to assure reporters it was &#8220;rigorous.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But he also said there was an informal process of self-selection and recomposition among applicants as the process went along. When Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced this supercluster business nearly two years ago, businesses and universities and incubators and industry associations started scrambling to constitute themselves as broad sectoral research initiatives. Some of their efforts were more impressive than others, and as the supercluster sector became self-aware and competitive, some would-be applicants threw in their towels early and joined with others.</p>\n<p>So now we have these five. Each will get between $150 million and $250 million to spend over five years. The ISED official who briefed me wouldn&#8217;t say which winners were at the high end and which at the low end of that range; to some extent it depends on their ability to attract matching money from local business or, I suppose, from Balsillie, Jim.</p>\n<p>The obvious questions that arise are to some extent contradictory. On one hand, a lot of observers are wondering whether this whole business is a perfect waste of money. On the other, it&#8217;s possible to wonder whether the federal investment is anywhere close to big enough. See? Contradictory.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take them in order. I was told, as the crowd dispersed after Bains&#8217;s announcement, that the protein people from Saskatchewan hope to take parts of plants that are currently discarded during processing and turn them into profitable new products. They have also noticed that more and more Canadians, often especially in younger demographics, are preferring substitutes like coconut milk and almond milk to traditional dairy and eggs. And they hope to get in on that. Now that they are officially a supercluster, the protein people from Saskatchewan want to get into those growth markets big time. But surely somebody on the open prairie was already thinking of heading in that direction? So it&#8217;ll never be clear which of the prairie protein products of the future was <em>caused</em> by superclustering and which would have happened anyway. Although one presumes one knows what the Liberals will claim, lo unto the end of days, when campaigning in Saskatchewan.</p>\n<p>The opposite worry is that the money Bains announced Thursday will in the end come to resemble a drop in the bucket. At the high end, $250 million over five years, the richest superclusters will get about $50 million a year. By coincidence, <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/quebec-urged-to-quintuple-ai-investment-or-risk-losing-edge-in-machine-learning/article37984029/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a new report released Thursday</a> called on the Quebec government to quintuple its own artificial-intelligence investment to $50 million a year (but for twice as long) or the recent AI bubble in Montreal might burst.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s only about keeping Canadian activity at about the scale it was yesterday. Bains began popularizing his pitch by claiming that each of his superclusters will be a &#8220;made-in-Canada Silicon Valley.&#8221; Would that it were so simple. If the feds&#8217; goal here is to step in for anemic Canadian venture-capital performance, they have barely begun to step in: <em>quarterly</em> VC investment in the real, made-in-Silicon-Valley Silicon Valley has <a href=\"http://svcip.com/halftime-report-investment-in-silicon-valley-has-rebounded-from-2015s-low/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lately hovered </a>around $US5 billion. That&#8217;s about <em>four hundred times</em> the Canadian supercluster burn rate.</p>\n<p>A visiting tech executive from Waterloo asked me the other day what I make of this whole project, and I had to say that it&#8217;s probably a good thing in a lot of ways. If good people from varied but compatible disciplines and activities have been having substantially more meetings about what they have in common and how they can face the future in smart and competitive ways, there&#8217;s a limit to my appetite for disdain. If thousands of people are suddenly in one another&#8217;s contact apps as they plan for a more ambitious next few years, there&#8217;s actually no telling how much good can come from it all, but it&#8217;s certainly more than zero and maybe vast.</p>\n<p>If pulling Silicon Valley out of a hat were easy, it&#8217;d have been done by now. Lord knows every region-state in the world is trying to do it. But the protein people from Saskatchewan were in a fine mood on Thursday, and you didn&#8217;t have to be Balsillie, Jim to feel pleased for them too.</p>\n<h3>MORE BY\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/author/inklesswells/\">PAUL WELLS</a>:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/how-opioid-vending-machines-could-fix-vancouvers-drug-crisis/\">How opioid vending machines could fix Vancouver\u2019s drug crisis</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/trudeau-and-resource-projects-the-urge-to-get-it-done/\">Trudeau and resource projects: the urge to get it done</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-on-electoral-reform-maybe-consistency-isnt-the-word/\">Justin Trudeau on electoral reform: Maybe consistency isn\u2019t the word</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/patrick-brown-and-priorities/\">Patrick Brown and priorities: Why the PC Party leader couldn\u2019t last</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/on-north-korea-its-basically-bad-cop-bad-cop/\">On North Korea, it\u2019s basically bad-cop, bad-cop</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/dispatches-from-the-ottawa-biography-wars/\">Dispatches from the Ottawa biography wars</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-battle-of-bill-morneau/\">The Battle of Bill Morneau</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/navdeep-bains-and-the-silicon-plant-people-from-saskatchewan/\">Navdeep Bains and the Silicon Plant People from Saskatchewan</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/navdeep-bains-and-the-silicon-plant-people-from-saskatchewan/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>2</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>How opioid vending machines could fix Vancouver&#8217;s drug crisis</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/how-opioid-vending-machines-could-fix-vancouvers-drug-crisis/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/how-opioid-vending-machines-could-fix-vancouvers-drug-crisis/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2018 12:00:54 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Downtown Eastside]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[opioid crisis]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[vancouver]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1097399</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Paul Wells: Overdoses killed 1,422 people in B.C. last year.

(Photograph by Rafal Gerszak)</p></div>\n<p>It took a long time for Dr. Mark Tyndall to decide that the best way to do his job would be to ensure Vancouverites could get hard drugs from automated vending machines.</p>\n<p>Tyndall, 58, is the director of the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control. He\u2019s been working with addicts for decades, helping them stay alive, helping them manage their addictions, helping those who think they might be ready\u2014and on most days, that\u2019s not a lot\u2014try to get off drugs.</p>\n<p>But lately he has grown weary of watching people die. Last year, overdoses killed 1,422 people in British Columbia, the highest number ever, a 43 per cent increase over 2016. It\u2019s time for something radical, Tyndall thinks. \u201cWe need to offer people the opportunity to get drugs that won\u2019t kill them,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>And not a few people. More like hundreds or thousands. So sometime in the next several weeks, in March or April, Tyndall will launch a pilot program to distribute hydromorphone pills (a pharmaceutical narcotic derived from morphine) to registered users, using vending machines that read the distinctive blood-vessel patterns in a user\u2019s finger to ensure they\u2019re going to the right addict.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/health/facing-the-opioid-crisis-an-establishment-doctor-heads-to-the-streets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facing the opioid crisis, an establishment doctor heads to the streets</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The machines are distributed by Dispension Industries, a company in Halifax that gets them from American Green, a company in North Carolina. Perhaps not surprisingly, given the name of the U.S. company, the machines were originally designed to distribute cannabis, but rejigging them to dispense hydromorphone pills is easy enough.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe media\u2019s kind of run with this idea of vending machines,\u201d Tyndall said ruefully. \u201cIt\u2019s given a lot of people the idea that we\u2019re going to put them in shopping malls, give them to children.\u201d That is not the case. \u201cIt\u2019s really more of an ATM than a vending machine. This is like a big metal box made of steel that can\u2019t be taken anywhere. Biometrics [the blood-vessel-scanning technology] for access. It\u2019ll tightly control how many pills you get out of it.\u201d Tyndall is considering calling the gadgets \u201cdispensing machines\u201d rather than \u201cvending machines,\u201d in hopes of freaking out fewer people.</p>\n<p>Vancouver\u2019s Downtown Eastside, defined as a de facto colony for people who inject or smoke hard drugs, is smaller than it used to be\u2014maybe half the 20 blocks it used to cover, with condo developments looming on all sides. On the warm January day when I visited, a lot of people are out, lining the sidewalks of East Hastings Street, a few side streets and many wide alleys off the main artery. Many are openly smoking or injecting drugs. It\u2019s a shocking sight the first time you visit. You get used to it pretty quickly.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1096531\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1096531\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC02_BC_OPIODS_POST01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"822\" height=\"543\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC02_BC_OPIODS_POST01.jpg 822w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC02_BC_OPIODS_POST01-300x198.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC02_BC_OPIODS_POST01-768x507.jpg 768w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC02_BC_OPIODS_POST01-375x248.jpg 375w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A user walks past a memorial as she arrives at Overdose Prevention Society safe-injection site in the Downtown Eastside, Vancouver, British Columbia, Monday, January 15, 2018. (Photograph by Rafal Gerszak)</p></div>\n<p>One of the striking aspects of life in the Downtown Eastside is that because so many of its residents and social services have had so much practice, it is actually one of the safest places in Canada to have a drug overdose. The Insite supervised-consumption site has been open in the neighbourhood for more than a decade, Tyndall tells me in a caf\u00e9 in the neighbourhood. Several less elaborate overdose-prevention sites, where users can take drugs at long tables and volunteers administer first aid if something goes awry, have opened more recently.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s rapid access to methadone and suboxone,\u201d used in treating narcotic addiction, Tyndall says. \u201cA lot of people carry naloxone all over the place.\u201d Naloxone blocks the effect of opioids, especially during an overdose. People here clip the little kits to their backpacks and take them everywhere. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a bit of supportive housing. There are outreach nurses.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/can-ottawa-stop-canadas-deadly-opioid-crisis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Can Ottawa stop Canada\u2019s deadly opioid crisis?</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The upshot is that if you\u2019re using opioids in the Downtown Eastside and something goes wrong, you\u2019re probably much closer to someone who can keep you from dying than you would be in most other places. Vancouver\u2019s fire department reports that while one person dies for every 17 calls to the city\u2019s 911 emergency line\u2014and in South Vancouver it\u2019s as high as one in five\u2014in the Downtown Eastside, only one in 24 calls leads to a fatality.</p>\n<p>But even when it\u2019s survivable, an overdose is a harrowing experience with unpredictable outcomes. This point was driven home when I saw a man collapse from an overdose in front of me. Tyndall had taken me to visit one of the Overdose Prevention Society sites run by Sarah Blyth, a community organizer. Strictly speaking, the place operates outside the law. In reality, the police never bother it.</p>\n<p>Tyndall hopes to put one of his dispensing machines in the back of Blyth\u2019s centre this spring. Blyth was explaining the centre\u2019s functioning to me when there was a thump at the plastic partition behind her. A man in his 50s using heroin at the end of one of the long steel tables had passed out and hit the partition on his way to the floor.</p>\n<p>Volunteers at the centre, themselves addicts in most cases\u2014they\u2019re called peers, and they\u2019re highly valued in places like this because addicts know how to spot an addict in distress\u2014crouched over the man, whose name was Allan, and tried to coax him back to consciousness. No dice. He wasn\u2019t breathing.</p>\n<p>One volunteer called 911 while two more gave Allan oxygen and an injection of naloxone. By the time the ambulance attendants arrived, minutes later, Allan was awake and sitting upright on the floor. The attendants quizzed the volunteers about his treatment. \u201cAll right, good work,\u201d one said after the briefing. They chatted with Allan briefly and left. He stayed sitting on the floor. They could have taken Allan to a hospital, Tyndall told me, but doctors could not have done more for him than Allan\u2019s peers had done on-site, and he would have had to walk back to the Downtown Eastside. Most of the neighbourhood\u2019s residents prefer to avoid the walk.</p>\n<p>If Allan had been alone at home, an overdose of the kind I watched might have killed him or it might have spared him. It\u2019s hard to guess. What\u2019s known is that 90 per cent of overdose deaths in B.C. happen to people who are home alone. But Allan was at what everyone in the Downtown Eastside calls Sarah\u2019s Place, so half an hour after he overdosed, he picked himself up and walked home.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/health/born-addicted-to-opioids/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Born addicted to opioids</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>This was a catastrophe averted. But it\u2019s hardly the best outcome. Tyndall says the Downtown Eastside is full of catastrophes averted, but it\u2019s sorely in need of better outcomes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can take you by the Crosstown clinic, which sees about 140 people every day for hydromorphone and heroin injections,\u201d he says. Crosstown is the only place in Canada authorized by Health Canada to distribute free drugs to addicts. \u201cThe model\u2019s been going on a long time. It\u2019s very intensive and very expensive. And not really scalable.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also not the kind of life most users can accommodate. \u201cEven if money was no object, most people don\u2019t want to go into a medical establishment three times a day. The protocol is, you have to stay there for 45 minutes after injection. So that\u2019s basically your whole life. It\u2019s three times a day, and most people don\u2019t travel far from the clinic. So they just mill around outside. So it\u2019s just not practical for most people to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tyndall\u2019s plan is for the hydromorphone to be distributed to far more people with far less supervision. He has a $1.4-million, three-year Health Canada grant to test his machines. He doesn\u2019t have final authorization to proceed, though he is talking to Health Canada officials nearly daily. That he has gotten this far is remarkable, because two successive federal Liberal health ministers, Jane Philpott and Ginette Petitpas Taylor, have said they wouldn\u2019t contemplate expanding access to doctor-distributed drugs for addicts. That Ottawa is wavering on that line is a measure of the desperation the opioid crisis is causing.</p>\n<p>Tyndall\u2019s pilot project will distribute pills three times a day to between 200 and 300 carefully selected people. \u201cIf it worked, we could put these machines out quite quickly and scale it up.\u201d He is aware the whole notion freaks people out.</p>\n<p>Every time I write about opioids, I tell Tyndall, I hear from readers who say, \u201cWe went from giving addicts a place where they can safely use the drug, to just giving them the drug. We\u2019re making it so easy for them. No wonder overdoses are skyrocketing. It\u2019s paradise for drug users.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tyndall\u2019s response: \u201cThat\u2019s why people need to go to one person, meet one person [who uses opioids daily]. Tell me they\u2019re living in paradise. I mean, it makes absolutely no sense. The people down here have gone through more hell than any of us could ever imagine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Addiction, he says, is a chronic relapsing disease. Most addicts don\u2019t stop. Prohibition forces them to spend their day committing petty theft or prostitution or whatever else they need to do to pay for their next fix. And even then they don\u2019t know whether their next fix will contain enough badly mixed carfentanyl to kill them. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask people to recover if they\u2019re dead. But the stigma goes so deep that I think a lot of people go, \u2018Well, who gives a shit? They die. Better for us. We don\u2019t have to pay their medical bills.\u2019\u2009\u201d</p>\n<p>How can a medical doctor distribute clean drugs to addicts? To Tyndall, the question is why he wouldn\u2019t, knowing that he is able to. \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough for me to say, \u2018Sorry, I have the drugs here that you need, but I\u2019m not going to be able to prescribe them to you. You\u2019ll have to go and find your own.\u2019 I now have a lot of ethical problems with that.\u201d</p>\n<h3>MORE BY\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/author/inklesswells/\">PAUL WELLS</a>:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/trudeau-and-resource-projects-the-urge-to-get-it-done/\">Trudeau and resource projects: the urge to get it done</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-on-electoral-reform-maybe-consistency-isnt-the-word/\">Justin Trudeau on electoral reform: Maybe consistency isn\u2019t the word</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/patrick-brown-and-priorities/\">Patrick Brown and priorities: Why the PC Party leader couldn\u2019t last</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/on-north-korea-its-basically-bad-cop-bad-cop/\">On North Korea, it\u2019s basically bad-cop, bad-cop</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/david-frum-interview-donald-trump/\">David Frum: Donald Trump is a threat to Western democracy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/dispatches-from-the-ottawa-biography-wars/\">Dispatches from the Ottawa biography wars</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-battle-of-bill-morneau/\">The Battle of Bill Morneau</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/friends-welcome-to-justin-trudeaus-ethical-island/\">Friends!

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang</p></div>\n<p>There was Catherine McKenna, the environment minister, in a roomful of Ottawa reporters on Thursday as she unveiled and defended the Trudeau government&#8217;s new assessment rules for major projects. These are the rules by which oil pipeline projects can be assessed for their environmental impact, so of course the stakes were sky-high.</p>\n<p>McKenna described a system that will be awfully impressive if it works: More projects will be assessed, each according to a wider set of criteria, with a greater number of interested groups invited to intervene in the assessment. And to hear the minister tell it, it&#8217;ll all happen faster than under the old rules.</p>\n<p>Leaving aside the odds on all of this working as advertised, it&#8217;s striking how much of an emphasis McKenna put on speed and predictability in her remarks. The point was even clearer in a prepared quote from Jim Carr, the natural resources minister, which was distributed with the press material.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>WATCH: Trudeau focused on &#8216;national interest&#8217; in Alberta-B.C. trade war</strong></p></blockquote>\n\t\t<div class=\"bc-video bc-video-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"player-loader\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n\t\t\t<iframe src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/video/iframe/13639244001/VJjIBwmqg/5729899785001\"\n\t\t\t\twidth=\"640\"\n\t\t\t\theight=\"360\"\n\t\t\t\tallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tmozallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; right: 0px; left: 0px;\" class=\"rdm-brightcove-videojs-iframe\"></iframe>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n<p>&#8220;A new wave of resource development is coming with more than $500 billion in projects planned over the next 10 years,&#8221; Carr said, or was reputed to have said. &#8220;We are building a better Canada, where investors, companies and all Canadians can have confidence that good projects will be approved in a timely manner and\u00a0 held to the highest standard.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/how-trudeau-hasnt-left-himself-any-wiggle-room-on-pipeline-politics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trudeau hasn\u2019t left himself any wiggle room on pipeline politics</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The very assertion that this new Canada is still being built suggests that so far it doesn&#8217;t exist\u2014that until now, investors couldn&#8217;t have confidence that good projects would be approved in a timely manner. Recent historical evidence suggests the same thing. It&#8217;s becoming a problem for Canada. It could become a bigger problem if it isn&#8217;t fixed.</p>\n<p>The nation stands transfixed as the NDP governments of Alberta and British Columbia feud over the fate of Kinder Morgan&#8217;s Trans Mountain project. The Conservative opposition is demanding that Justin Trudeau come back from San Francisco to fix the problem. It&#8217;s not clear why he needs to fix it this week, or why he&#8217;d have better luck now than he did last year, or the year before, or better than Stephen Harper had before him.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s clear that at bottom, Trudeau intends the same thing Harper did: That a pipeline get built. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to ensure that pipeline gets built because it is in the national interest,&#8221; the Prime Minister <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-kinder-morgan-california-1.4527516\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told reporters</a> in San Francisco. And I had to smile because the phrasing was so familiar.</p>\n<p>Six years ago Joe Oliver was Stephen Harper&#8217;s minister of natural resources. On the heels of Barack Obama&#8217;s refusal to promptly sanction construction of the Keystone XL pipeline through U.S. territory, Harper went on the fritz for a while, and Oliver with him\u2014threatening and denigrating opponents of pipeline projects, flirting with an overture to China, and above all deeply preoccupied with the prompt approval of oil pipelines specifically, and other natural resource projects more generally. <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/an-open-letter-from-natural-resources-minister-joe-oliver/article4085663/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The open letter Joe Oliver published</a>\u00a0was his manifesto, and his boss&#8217;s. That letter is one of maybe a half-dozen crucial documents for understanding the Harper decade.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/in-b-c-and-albertas-pipeline-fight-only-one-side-is-unified/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In B.C. and Alberta\u2019s pipeline fight, only one side is unified</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;Anyone looking at the record of approvals for certain major projects across Canada cannot help but come to the conclusion that many of these projects have been delayed too long,&#8221; Oliver wrote. He mentioned the Mackenzie Valley Gas Pipeline project, first proposed in the 1970s and <em>never</em> built, a totem of alienation in the country&#8217;s Western resource-producing regions. One way to fix such obstruction, Oliver argued\u2014in terms Catherine McKenna could have used today, and in fact basically did\u2014was to improve major project assessment. &#8220;Our regulatory system must be fair, independent, consider different viewpoints including those of Aboriginal communities, review the evidence dispassionately and then make an objective determination,&#8221; Oliver wrote. &#8220;It must be based on science <em>[ed. note: !!!]</em> and the facts.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe reviews for major projects can be accomplished in a quicker and more streamlined fashion,&#8221; Oliver continued, before concluding with the words Trudeau echoed today, six years later: &#8220;It is an urgent matter of Canada&#8217;s national interest.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The punchline, of course, is that of the major pipeline projects under consideration when Oliver was a minister\u2014Keystone XL, Energy East, Northern Gateway\u2014none has been built, six years later.</p>\n<p>Harper Conservatives and Trudeau Liberals would be appalled at any suggestion they&#8217;ve essentially collaborated in the same decade-long wild goose chase, so let&#8217;s cheerfully grant both sides the differences in approach that help each believe they&#8217;re not the other. The point is that we&#8217;re now up to two consecutive prime ministers who&#8217;ve identified pipelines as constituting part of Canada&#8217;s &#8220;national interest,&#8221; a term no national government invokes lightly. And yet they&#8217;re still coming up snake-eyes.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why Trudeau was sounding all get-er-done in San Francisco, and why McKenna and Carr were signing a <em>Financial Post</em> <a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/opinion/catherine-mckenna-jim-carr-weaker-project-reviews-didnt-get-things-built-our-plan-will\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">op-ed</a> whose theme was that their process would ensure success in building big resource projects.</p>\n<p>Again I&#8217;m less interested today in whether they&#8217;ll succeed than that building big things is the goal. Inevitably a lot of the current debate is bound up in the environmental politics (I&#8217;m tempted to say <em>the theology</em>) of oil. But the question is bigger: Is Canada a place where <em>any</em> project that crosses provincial borders and traverses an array of unceded territories can happen?</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/albertas-strong-carbon-policy-is-key-to-getting-pipelines-built/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alberta\u2019s strong carbon policy is key to getting pipelines built</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>People with deep pockets are watching. On the same day McKenna made her announcement, Suncor&#8217;s CEO Steve Williams <a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/suncor-not-embarking-on-major-new-projects-unless-canada-up-its-game\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">folded his hand</a>, declaring that Canada&#8217;s just become too hard a country to spend a few billion dollars in. Last autumn the Fraser Institute published a report suggesting that <a href=\"http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/fraser-institute-news-release-business-investment-canada-second-lowest-among-17-advanced-2236876.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">business investment in Canada is second-lowest</a> out of 17 advanced economies.</p>\n<p>The Trudeau Liberals&#8217; vaunted but still embryonic Canada Infrastructure Bank is designed to lure big international investors for big projects. Months after the Bank announced the names of its board, it still has no CEO and the only project publicly known as a candidate for CIB investment, Montreal&#8217;s audacious regional rail network, looks like it&#8217;s\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-light-rail-system-to-be-built-by-snc-lavalin-pomerleau-1.4526038\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">costing more and arriving later than planned</a>, though so far not seriously so.</p>\n<p>Trudeau entertainingly got in trouble four years ago for saying he had &#8220;a level of admiration&#8221; for China&#8217;s &#8220;basic dictatorship.&#8221; It&#8217;s worth recalling the entire thought: What he liked about Chinese dictatorship wasn&#8217;t the enforced cap on procreation or the systematic persecution of Tibet. It was the <em>brisk execution of major projects</em>. &#8220;Their basic dictatorship is actually allowing them to turn their economy around on a dime,&#8221; Trudeau said. In hindsight it seems Trudeau was not expressing admiration so much as envy.</p>\n<p>When I suggest that Canada may be developing a reputation as a nice place where nothing big is ever permitted to happen, government sources are quick to put things into perspective: Canadian policy gridlock is a pretty mild problem, they say, compared to the chaos in much of the world. The next dollar you invest in Canada is likely to have a happier life, they say, than your next dollar invested almost anywhere else. And there&#8217;s something to that.</p>\n<p>But the scale of the investment Trudeau hoped to attract is incompatible with the suspicion that any next dollar anyone invests in Canada will just lie there like a latke.

I came to very clearly believe that a form of proportional representation would be harmful to Canada.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Great. When was that? After his benighted former democratic-reform minister, Maryam Monsef, held consultations in 2016? No, apparently well before:</p>\n<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ve been consistent about this for a long time,&#8221; Trudeau told Hall, &#8220;in debates during my leadership race as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So apparently we are talking about convictions Justin Trudeau held in 2013 and continued to hold\u2014consistently, in a consistent fashion, in the manner in which one normally holds convictions when one is being described by others as &#8220;consistent,&#8221; which is to say, consistently\u2014throughout the span of time connecting 2013 to 2018.</p>\n<p>Hall, who is a sucker for punishment as indeed one must be if one is to flog this particular dead horse with this particular prime minister, persisted. &#8220;Do you understand why people are still so upset about that?&#8221; the host of The House asked his guest. A few members of the show&#8217;s audience who had submitted questions about this particular dead horse &#8220;went on to ask about trust and whether this is something they can trust you on,&#8221; Hall added.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/trudeaus-zeal-for-electoral-reform-fell-with-his-own-electoral-success/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trudeau\u2019s zeal for electoral reform fell with his own electoral success</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The PM was ready for that one. &#8220;They can trust me to put the interests of the country ahead of my own partisan interest to tick a box off my campaign platform.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Here we have a chance to do some checking. What did Trudeau&#8217;s platform say? Here is the section on electoral reform, in its entirety:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>&#8220;We will make every vote count.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>&#8220;We are committed to ensuring that 2015 will be the last federal election conducted under the first-past-the-post voting system. We will convene an all-party Parliamentary committee to review a wide variety of reforms, such as ranked ballots, proportional representation, mandatory\u00a0</em><em>voting, and online voting. This committee will deliver its recommendations to Parliament. Within 18 months of forming government, we will introduce legislation to enact electoral reform.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>And you know, it&#8217;s funny, because <a href=\"https://www.liberal.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-plan-for-a-strong-middle-class.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Liberal platform of the day</a> was both voluminous\u201488 pages\u2014and capacious in its margins, in the manner of an undergrad essay formatted to fill as many pages as possible. And yet in all that white space, the Liberals could not, apparently, find room to add &#8220;which we very clearly believe would be harmful to Canada&#8221; after the words &#8220;proportional representation&#8221; in the excerpt above. Formatting is such a delicate thing.</p>\n<p>It would have been handy if the Liberal leader had specified <em>before</em> people voted, and <em>before</em> his ministers spent a year consulting them, that he had already privately discarded one of the leading systems of electoral reform. The danger was that people would vote Liberal in the mistaken belief that when their election platform listed both &#8220;ranked ballots&#8221; and &#8220;proportional representation&#8221; that it was agnostic as between the two.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-we-broke-our-electoral-reform-promise-signed-a-liberal-mp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Why we broke our electoral reform promise. Signed, a Liberal MP</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>And indeed, for some time after his election, Trudeau continued to claim he had no preferred system. I interviewed the prime minister at the beginning of my brief stint working for the Toronto Star, and I asked him specifically whether he preferred preferential ballots. As I <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/06/08/trudeau-points-to-black-and-whiteness-of-referendum-in-electoral-reform-debate-wells.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote at the time</a>:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>\u201cBecause I\u2019m the leader of a party that is very much focused on appealing to the broadest possible number of people as opposed to narrowing voices, you could certainly make arguments around one form or another,\u201d he said, backing away from a clear answer in the home stretch of a long sentence.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>\u201cBut <strong>I\u2019m really open</strong>. I\u2019m really open to listening to Canadians. And <strong>actually, I have moved in my thinking toward a greater degree of openness towards what Canadians actually want.</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>\u201cI\u2019m very aware that the decision we take on electoral reform \u2014 we as a country \u2014 will have long-reaching implications over the next generations. Because you don\u2019t change your parliamentary system very quickly or easily. And my long-term focus is getting the right system for Canadians. And <strong>it\u2019s not up to any one person, even if it\u2019s the prime minister, to define exactly what that right system is.</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>\u201cWe can all have different opinions and perceptions, but mine are obviously going to be coloured by the fact that I think diversity within a party, broad-based consensus, is the best thing for this country. Liberals would certainly agree. <strong>Canadians might not agree.</strong> And I think this is an important conversation to have, where <strong>we do have to respect Canadians.</strong>\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Those statements\u2014about openness and how it wasn&#8217;t up to one person to define the right system, and how he did have to respect Canadians\u2014are no longer operative. If it&#8217;s any consolation, as he approaches his second attempt at explaining his plans to an electorate in 2019, Trudeau is getting better at saying he does not want a real debate. &#8220;I will not move towards any form of proportional representation,&#8221; he told the CBC&#8217;s Hall. &#8220;But if people want to talk about a different system that might benefit Canadians, like a preferential ballot, I&#8217;d be open to that.&#8221; He&#8217;s like Henry Ford selling Model Ts: You can get it in any colour so long as it&#8217;s black.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/why-the-electoral-reform-sham-will-breed-cynicism/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Why the electoral reform sham will breed cynicism</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Two final things. First, I never put much stock in electoral reform, and I would not be interested in belabouring Justin Trudeau&#8217;s obvious flagrant disingenuousness on the question if he would simply stop being obviously flagrantly disingenuous. His putative &#8220;consistency&#8221; in standing up for the &#8220;interests of Canada&#8221; is incompatible with the plain language of his campaign platform and his campaign speeches. He tried to pull a fast one. It worked for a while and then he had to drop the charade. Congratulating himself for any part of this contemptible farce is a bad fit.</p>\n<p>Second, it would help if more voters had some self-respect. What Trudeau did on electoral reform is <em>so easy to do</em> that very few political leaders can resist it: Deliver half a promise and let hope fill in the blanks. It&#8217;s what Jean Chr\u00e9tien did when he promised a magical replacement for the GST that would raise the same revenues while annoying nobody. Do yourself a favour: Next time a politician promises &#8220;change,&#8221; and you find yourself filling in all the details of the change in your heart, demand details. You&#8217;re probably being played for a sucker.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/justin-trudeau/\">JUSTIN TRUDEAU</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a

ET):</strong> <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/patrick-brown-denies-troubling-allegations-in-hasty-statement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Patrick Brown has announced he will resign as leader of the Ontario PC Party, but will stay on as an MPP.</a></em></p>\n<p>I know I&#8217;m paid to game out the electoral repercussions of public events, but it is not easy to generate much enthusiasm for the task in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/patrick-brown-denies-sexual-misconduct-allegations-from-two-women-1.3774686\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">explosive allegations of sexual assault</a> by Ontario Progressive Conservative leader Patrick Brown.</p>\n<p>The province&#8217;s election, scheduled for June 7 under a fixed election-date law, will sort itself out, and suddenly seems quite distant anyway. What is much closer is the claims themselves, unearthed by CTV reporters Rachel Aiello and Glen McGregor and backed in one case by an extensive and contemporaneous social-media record. The stories told by the reporters&#8217; two sources are far worse than stale anecdotes about an after-hours scoundrel. Rather, they suggest the systematic use of alcohol to deny meaningful consent to very young women, one of whom depended on Brown for career advancement.</p>\n<p>These accounts have not been independently verified. Brown has denied them and said he will seek legal recourse against his accusers. That&#8217;s his right. I know Andrea Horwath, the province&#8217;s NDP leader, is the furthest thing from an impartial judge, but I think she <a href=\"https://www.ontariondp.ca/news/horwath-calls-browns-resignation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">drew</a> a useful distinction between the right to a day in court and the right to lead a political party, come what may: only the first of those rights actually exists. Brown &#8220;deserves his day in court,&#8221; Horwath <a href=\"https://www.ontariondp.ca/news/horwath-calls-browns-resignation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said in a news release</a>, &#8220;but no person can lead a political party in this province with allegations like these hanging over his head.\u201d</p>\n<p>Among those who seem to agree are most of the people who were, until Wednesday night, Brown&#8217;s closest political advisors, including two I know personally and take to be among the most thoughtful members of their party, deputy campaign chair Dan Robertson and chief of staff Alykhan Velshi. They quit rather than support their leader. Given the success they&#8217;ve had bringing Brown close to a likely electoral victory, it must have been a terribly difficult day. But not a hard decision: Robertson and Velshi would certainly have helped Brown impose a swift exit on any member of the PC caucus who faced similar accusations, and due process take the hindmost.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/patrick-brown-denies-sexual-misconduct-allegations-transcript/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Patrick Brown denies allegations: Transcript</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Armchair political theorists sometimes lament the fact that Canadian political parties lack a formal mechanism for replacing their leaders through a simple vote of their parliamentary caucus. Caucuses used to pick and depose leaders just like that, on short notice and with no appeal to the broader party membership. Australian political party caucuses sometimes launch such &#8220;spills&#8221; against their leaders, to the delighted envy of Canadian process wonks.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday night, observers were quick to note there is no such mechanism, either formal or traditional, in the Ontario PC constitution for deposing a leader who doesn&#8217;t want to go. I believe we&#8217;ll soon be reminded no formal mechanism is needed.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Hayward</p></div>\n<p>Chrystia Freeland has become Canada&#8217;s\u2014and on some days the world&#8217;s\u2014minister of long shots. When she&#8217;s not preparing for a <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/a-peacekeeping-force-on-the-russia-ukraine-border/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">peacekeeping mission in Ukraine that&#8217;s hard to imagine</a>, she&#8217;s preparing for a diplomatic breakthrough with North Korea that&#8217;s hard to imagine. It is hard to blame her: Better is always possible, as someone once said, and for the improbable to become real it must first be imagined.</p>\n<p>So while Freeland&#8217;s one-day conference in Vancouver on peace in the Korean peninsula, co-hosted with the United States secretary of state Rex Tillerson (she calls him &#8220;Rex,&#8221; he calls her &#8220;Foreign Minister Freeland&#8221;), is open to all kinds of criticism\u2014there are no North Koreans present, nor anyone from China or Russia, and there is in fact nothing you could charitably call a plan for getting back to a negotiating table\u2014it&#8217;s probably all still worth doing. Better to jaw jaw than to war war, as someone once said.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s well known that Tillerson&#8217;s boss, President Donald Trump, holds diplomacy in dim view, and it&#8217;s widely suspected he is not fond of Tillerson either. You could almost hear a big prop clock ticking whenever Tillerson spoke, during the 37 minutes at the beginning of Tuesday&#8217;s meeting when reporters were permitted to listen before being escorted out. But what in life is perfect? As of today, Tillerson is still the secretary of state. Make hay while the sun shines, as someone once said.</p>\n<p>Still, the circumstances made the proceedings strikingly gloomy. This was no meeting of Polyannas looking for any excuse to make nice with our North Korean friends. The frequency of North Korean missile tests and nuclear test explosions\u201420 last year, the U.K.&#8217;s Boris Johnson told his colleagues\u2014makes the country a present threat to its neighbours. Of the five ministers who spoke at the opening session, every one called strongly for continued and reinforced sanctions to starve North Korea to the bargaining table.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/north-korea-missiles-are-reaching-higher-and-further-than-ever-before/\">See just how far North Korean missiles can strike</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Freeland set the tone. She noted the 206,000 Canadians of Korean descent, many of them in her own Toronto riding of University\u2013Rosedale. She welcomed last week&#8217;s announcement of military-to-military talks between North and South Korea, and of North Korean participation in the Pyeongchang Olympics. &#8220;These are encouraging signals.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>WATCH: Canada and partners tell North Korea to give up nuclear weapons</strong></p></blockquote>\n<div>\n\t\t<div class=\"bc-video bc-video-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"player-loader\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n\t\t\t<iframe src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/video/iframe/13639244001/VJjIBwmqg/5713001858001\"\n\t\t\t\twidth=\"640\"\n\t\t\t\theight=\"360\"\n\t\t\t\tallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tmozallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; right: 0px; left: 0px;\" class=\"rdm-brightcove-videojs-iframe\"></iframe>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n</div>\n<p>You could hear the &#8220;but&#8221; coming. &#8220;But let me be clear:\u00a0no true progress can be made in addressing instability in the Korean Peninsula until North Korea commits to changing course and verifiably and irreversibly abandoning all its weapons of mass destruction.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tillerson concurred. He brought a chart showing the density of commercial air traffic over Korea and the surrounding region, and argued that North Korean tests endanger that traffic. &#8220;We must increase the cost of the regime\u2019s behaviour to the point that North Korea comes to the table for credible negotiations,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>If anything, Taro Kono, Japan&#8217;s foreign minister, was more hawkish. &#8220;Some&#8221; are taking North Korea&#8217;s Olympic overture as a sign that sanctions should be loosened, Kono said. That&#8217;s &#8220;too naive,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/the-case-for-using-military-force-against-north-korea/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The case for using military force against North Korea</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;I think North Korea wants to buy some time to continue their nuclear and missile programs. They simply want to get something out of this dialogue. I would therefore argue that this recognition should be the starting point of today\u2019s discussion. Secondly, we should judge [North Korea&#8217;s] intention in terms of what they are actually doing, not in terms of what we hope they are doing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>What to make of Kim Jong-un&#8217;s apparent overtures to South Korea and the rest of the world? &#8220;Number one: They must be hoping to get sanctions lifted by some countries,&#8221; Kono said. &#8220;Number two: They must be attempting to obtain financial assistance in whatever form, exploiting the goodwill of others. Number three: They must also be hoping that the military exercises between the United States and the [South Korean] military be cancelled. Number four: they must be hoping to drive a wedge between tough countries and those that are not so tough.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If anyone thought South Korea might be one of those &#8220;countries that are not so tough,&#8221; the country&#8217;s foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, was quick to disabuse them. Kang opened by welcoming the North&#8217;s Olympic overture, but pivoted as neatly as Freeland had: &#8220;Despite these overtures to improve relations with the south, North Korea has yet to show any intention to fulfill its international obligations regarding denuclearization.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It was fascinating to watch Freeland while this was going on. The minister has no poker face. When Kang stopped lauding North Korea&#8217;s token overtures toward dialogue and reminded everyone its nuclear program continues unchecked, Freeland broke into a wide smile. When Kang added that the South was willing to accompany the North toward a brighter future\u2014&#8221;if they make the right choice&#8221; by abandoning their nuclear program\u2014Freeland looked like her day had been made.</p>\n<p>On that note, the assembled foreign ministers kicked the reporters out and got down to brass tacks.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a

Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy, David Frum admits, he was \u201cTrump-curious\u201d\u2014intrigued, and willing to believe the Manhattan real estate developer might shake up a staid Republican Party. That didn\u2019t last. Now Frum, the veteran Canadian-born journalist and former speechwriter for former president George W. Bush, sees Trump and his enablers as a threat to American democracy, and as part of a widespread assault on democratic rules across the Western world. He spoke in Toronto with <em>Maclean\u2019s</em> about his new book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Trumpocracy-Corruption-American-David-Frum/dp/0062796739\"><em>Trumpocracy: The Corruption of the American Republic</em></a>. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Q: One of the first things that I noticed about this book is that if you took Donald Trump out of it\u2014if you took Donald Trump out of today\u2019s United States\u2014your book still describes a country that\u2019s in a lot of trouble.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> It describes a Western world that\u2019s in a lot of trouble. This is maybe something that, from a Canadian perspective, I bring to this project. I keep telling my American friends, \u201cIf you think of Donald Trump as only something that is happening inside the United States, you\u2019re missing it.\u201d Because there are Trump-like events happening across the Western world, in Warsaw Pact countries, in France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands. As we speak, the second-largest party in the Dutch legislature\u2014who\u2019s more level-headed than the Dutch?\u2014is Geert Wilders\u2019s party, which is a very Trump-like party, and they\u2019ve got 33 out of 150 seats.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Your book describes an impressive array of what you call \u201cenablers\u201d: a conservative entertainment complex, essentially Fox News, that propagandized for him; fellow candidates for president who appeased him; a Republican Party apparatus that submitted to him; a donor elite who funded him; a Congressional party that protected him; writers and intellectuals who invented excuses for him; and millions of rank-and-file Republicans who accepted him. What is it in Donald Trump that brought all of those people to heel? Or what is it in them that made them ready to be seduced?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Different people had different motives. In some cases, it was just arrogance, the belief that they could use Donald Trump for their own ends rather than be used by him. For example, Trump didn\u2019t have a polling operation until very late in his campaign. How did he know what to do? And the answer was that the Ted Cruz people leaked their polls to Trump because they were looking forward to eliminating all the other rivals, clearing the way for a Cruz-Trump fight that they were certain Cruz would win. Well, in the end, Cruz was the last man standing, it\u2019s true. And Cruz lost. If he had known at the beginning what he knew at the end, he might have thought twice. The Congressional Republican Party thought they could make Trump their tool to impose their very unpopular agenda. Instead, they became his tool.</p>\n<p>I need to make it clear: I am a very conservative person. And there are a lot of things that Donald Trump\u2019s government or administration is doing that I might agree with. The point is we have to defend the rules of the game. And one of the things that has empowered Donald Trump is that not enough people are serious enough about defending the rules of the game, maybe because they don\u2019t understand how endangered those rules are.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Trump says the rules of the game are the problem, because the rules of the game\u2014and we hear this from the governing party in Poland, for instance\u2014elevate a certain kind of person and create a certain spoils system that not everyone benefits from. And that you have to smash the rules of the game so that ordinary people can get back into the game.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Right. What has enabled these kinds of parties is precisely the failure of elites to deliver. I wrote a history of the 1970s a long time ago, and one of the stories I tell is: whatever happened to the man in the white lab coat? If you watch a movie from between the end of the Second World War and the mid-1970s, whenever anyone steps out in a white lab coat, they\u2019re there to offer a solution. They\u2019re there to tell you how the time machine is going to work, how the laser\u2019s going to save the day. They\u2019re going to give you James Bond\u2019s array of tools. After about 1975, whenever the man in the white lab coat steps out, it\u2019s to come up with some crazy idea that\u2019s going to bring ruin on everybody. \u201cLet\u2019s clone dinosaurs!\u201d And the last we see of him is disappearing down the gullet of the Tyrannosaurus rex.</p>\n<p>I mentioned I\u2019m a conservative person. I\u2019m going to say something very conservative. Elites are inevitable in politics. That is how politics is going to work. Because most people will not put in the effort, most people don\u2019t have the knowledge. It is an elite game, always. The question is, are your elites responsible, patriotic, public-spirited? Do they think about the interests of others, not just themselves? And the story of Western politics since, I would say, the beginning of the century, maybe a little earlier, is that as elites become more separated, more selfish, as they leave behind their populations and don\u2019t think about them, they become discredited. And the people look for alternatives. But the alternative is worse. Those rules of the game protect us all. And they are more precious than almost any political outcome.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Do you think he\u2019s going to serve out his term?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> I think that\u2019s the way you have to bet, barring some kind of health event. Obviously, he won\u2019t be impeached or removed so long as the Republicans hold even one House of Congress. And even should they lose both in November of 2018, launching an impeachment\u2014as the Republicans discovered with Bill Clinton\u2014is very dangerous to the impeaching party. Unless you have a highly credible set of extremely damning facts, you turn a constitutional crisis into a political crisis. You rally potential supporters of the impeached president to him. You make his base bigger. So I imagine that he is likely to serve out the full term.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: So the thesis whereby the Republicans decide he\u2019s a liability\u2014he dips below a certain level in the polls and they decide that he\u2019s a stone and not something lifting them up\u2014you don\u2019t buy that?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Donald Trump is the least unpopular thing about today\u2019s Republican Party. I mean, the idea that a Mitch McConnell or a Paul Ryan could say, \u201cLet\u2019s toss Trump overboard and return to our program of plutocratic politics, health care removal, massive income tax cuts for the affluent, deregulation of finance\u201d\u2014if they cut loose from Donald Trump, it\u2019s like, you know, storm in channel, continent cut off. If they cut loose from him, they are much likelier to sink.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Your defence of Obamacare\u2014or at least your constant Cassandra-like warnings to the Republican Party that trying to take Obamacare back would never work and would be self-destructive\u2014that\u2019s well-known. Your suspicion of the current state of the American immigration system probably makes you fewer friends in Canada. A Canadian asking a Canadian would say: What\u2019s your problem with immigration?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Well, let\u2019s start with the health care. Because I actually see these as very related issues. One of the great drivers of the alienation that has made Donald Trump possible is that the growth in the American economy has been weak. In the decade from 2005 to 2015, there was not one year when the United States hit three per cent growth. And to the extent there\u2019s been growth, virtually all of it\u2014and, in many years, literally all of it\u2014has been collected by the top 10 per cent of the population. Obviously, if we knew how to make growth faster, we would. We don\u2019t. And it\u2019s very difficult to make growth more broadly shared. Because it\u2019s not just the United States that has this problem.</p>\n<p>So, one of the reasons I\u2019ve been interested in health care is that here is something you can do, that governments know how to do, that could lift one of the largest burdens of worry from the shoulders of tens of millions of people for whom the rest of the economy isn\u2019t working. A lot of the things that are in Obamacare that Republicans don\u2019t like were deliberately put there to force Republicans to negotiate. Republicans wouldn\u2019t negotiate, so we got Obamacare with all of the fur on it. Once it\u2019s there, of course, it\u2019s very hard to take health care benefits away from people, as the Republicans discovered.</p>\n<p>Immigration is driven by the same concern, which is how do you build a middle-class society? The argument is very strong that immigration in the United States, because it is so concentrated at the bottom of the labour market, because so much of it is illegal, depresses wages and working conditions. Economists will say that\u2019s not true. They have models that show that even the lowest-skilled immigration drives up wages. But when you look at those models, how do you get this? And they say, \u201cWell, what we do is we compare the effect of this group of immigrants on that group of natives and we see what happens.\u201d And I say, \u201cWell, what if a native leaves the job market altogether? What happens then?\u201d \u201cOh, we stop counting him.\u201d \u201cOh, okay. How many people is that?\u201d \u201cOh, that\u2019s a 10th of American men between 25 and 54.\u201d Labour force participation for that group was 98 per cent when you and I were young. It\u2019s 88 per cent now. They vanish from the economists\u2019 models.</p>\n<p>Now, they\u2019re not driven out entirely by immigration. It\u2019s drugs and disability and other things. But America\u2019s immigration system has created a society in which labour is very, very disposable.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: It\u2019s striking how hopeful the note you conclude on is. It\u2019s a call to arms to people: if you value the institutions, participate in the institutions. Is that something you can really get your heart into, that note of optimism?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Look, I\u2019m not an optimist by temperament at all. It\u2019s easy for me to sink into pessimism and despair. But the one question I don\u2019t dodge\u2014that I actually point-blank refuse to answer\u2014is when people start asking me to predict how this is all going to go. I refuse to do it because I don\u2019t want to be a spectator. I don\u2019t want to be making book on this contest. We\u2019re in it. So you have to act as if you\u2019re an optimist, even if you\u2019re not. I was in the White House, probably the only administration I\u2019ll ever work for. The administration was not a success, neither at home nor abroad. The Iraq War was not a success. The condition of the average person was not enough better at the end of seven years of George Bush [than] it was at the beginning, and certainly it all ended in the collapse that was the Great Recession. So I feel a sense of karmic obligation to the universe because of that.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/donald-trump/\">DONALD TRUMP</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/asking-if-oprah-will-run-for-president-is-the-wrong-question/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Asking if Oprah will run for president is the wrong question</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/trump-and-oprah-are-one-in-the-same/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>What are the odds of Oprah Winfrey becoming U.S. president?</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/genius-not-crazy-allies-line-up-to-declare-trump-mentally-sound/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>\u2018Genius,\u2019 \u2018Not crazy\u2019: Allies line up to declare Trump mentally sound</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/how-sports-diplomacy-could-lead-to-an-unprecedented-shift-for-the-koreas/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>How sports diplomacy could lead to an unprecedented shift for the Koreas</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/why-scientific-information-is-the-key-to-democracy/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Why scientific information is the key to democracy</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/will-one-bad-tweet-end-the-world/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>How one Donald Trump tweet could end the world</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/north-korea-reopens-cross-border-communications-with-south-korea/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>North Korea reopens cross-border communications with South Korea</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/joseph-stiglitz-on-the-anti-globalization-movements-epic-transformation/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Joseph Stiglitz on the anti-globalization movement\u2019s epic transformation</strong></a>\t\t<div class=\"bc-video bc-video-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"player-loader\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n\t\t\t<iframe src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/video/iframe/13639244001/VJjIBwmqg/5708201332001\"\n\t\t\t\twidth=\"640\"\n\t\t\t\theight=\"360\"\n\t\t\t\tallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tmozallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"width: 100%;

(Justin Tang/CP)</p></div>\n<p>&#8220;I grew up in the kind of family lots of Canadians would recognize,&#8221; Andrew Scheer says in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AndrewScheerMP/videos/1870640219636388/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">his latest Facebook get-to-know-me video</a>.</p>\n<p>Really? What sort of family is that, and how does it contrast in electorally useful ways with the bizarre family rituals of certain hypothetical other incumbent leaders?</p>\n<p>&#8220;My mom was a nurse. My dad worked for a newspaper,&#8221; Scheer continues. So far, so normal. (I checked: His dad wasn&#8217;t a reporter, which in the struggle for grassroots credibility must count as extraordinary good luck.) &#8220;They had to make a lot of sacrifices for me and my sisters. It wasn&#8217;t always easy. Like a lot of people I had to take the bus everywhere because our family didn&#8217;t have a car. And I learned you have to have a pretty good pitch if you&#8217;re trying to get a girl to meet you for a date at a bus stop.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One wants to reach back in time to young Scheer and tell him that part of his pitch should involve reassuring his romantic interests that the bulk of the date wouldn&#8217;t actually take place at the bus stop. But he seems to have done fine without our help, because he married young and now has five smiling children.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I always had to get a job to pay my own way,&#8221; Scheer says. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s a lot of people&#8217;s experience.&#8221; Well, yes, a lot of people who weren&#8217;t literally born at 24 Sussex Drive. &#8220;I had a paper route as a kid. I sold popcorn at football and hockey games. I&#8217;ve been a waiter.&#8221; This gave him insight into the importance of &#8220;local businesses,&#8221; a term Scheer has lately used in his fight against Bill Morneau&#8217;s proposed tax changes. &#8220;I worked for an insurance broker at a family-run business.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/andrew-scheer-of-the-suburbs-vs-justin-trudeau-and-his-throngs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Andrew Scheer of the suburbs vs Justin Trudeau and his throngs</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Why, Andrew Scheer has built his life in the kind of institutions now under attack from the tax-changing depredations of Bill Morneau and the Liberals. Not that the ad says so explicitly. You&#8217;re just supposed to put two and two together. Anyway, Scheer concludes, his fondness for the type of upbringing common to families most Canadians would recognize is &#8220;why I&#8217;m in this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite some editing peculiarities\u2014all the time Scheer talks about sacrificing for a life that&#8217;s not easy, the ad shows Scheer and a staffer gliding elegantly through the marble hallways of Parliament&#8217;s Centre Block\u2014this is a pretty good example of campaigning via biography.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s in the nature of such products that they&#8217;re needlessly coy. Scheer never does get around to saying whose coddled and decadent upbringing he was saved from, but I don&#8217;t think the Conservatives would be crushed if viewers&#8217; thoughts turned, entirely spontaneously, to Justin Trudeau. Now, it&#8217;s true that Trudeau&#8217;s father worked for the newspapers too, sort of, but in most other particulars his early life contrasts with Scheer&#8217;s. Pollsters often check whether respondents believe a given political leader &#8220;understands people like me.&#8221; The Conservatives&#8217; hope is that Scheer will be seen to understand, and will himself become easier to understand.</p>\n<p>Stephen Harper started to emphasize his own humble upbringing when Paul Martin, the millionaire son of a political lifer, became Harper&#8217;s chief opponent in 2003. But this is hardly only a Conservative gambit. In Alberta it&#8217;s become pretty common lately to hear members of the embattled NDP government explain their policy choices by saying &#8220;parents understand&#8221; this or that. We are expected to fill in a blank: that Jason Kenney, who is not a parent, doesn&#8217;t understand.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s normal, when engaging in biography politics, to skip lightly over certain unhelpful details of one&#8217;s own biography. Scheer, for instance, does not mention that he has been a Member of Parliament making more than $100,000 a year from taxpayers, with <a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/salaries-of-canadian-mps-2015-16-510493\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gusts to nearly $250,000</a>, since he was 25. Or that he lived for more than half a decade at Kingsmere, the stately Speaker&#8217;s residence in the rolling Gatineau Hills, a commute easily navigated when one has a car and driver at one&#8217;s constant disposition.</p>\n<p>Nobody should begrudge any MP or any former Speaker such things. And indeed I&#8217;d go so far as to say a lot of Canadians would recognize them as a reasonable part of a dedicated public servant&#8217;s lifestyle. But one cannot squeeze everything into a short video, and these are the parts Scheer left out.</p>\n<p>It should come as no surprise that the Conservatives are emphasizing lifestyle as they go about introducing their new leader to Canadians. Harper&#8217;s work to contrast his own life with Martin&#8217;s eventually helped him win. And after the year the Liberals have had, culminating in Bill Morneau&#8217;s tax trauma and Trudeau&#8217;s comeuppance at the hands of the ethics commissioner, they have nobody to blame but themselves if they&#8217;ve opened up room for attack on their people-like-me flank.</p>\n<p>Not that biography is everything. Scheer establishes his credentials as a bus-rider, and elsewhere has complained that the Liberals have scrapped the Conservatives&#8217; public transit tax credit. It will be up to voters who commute to decide whether that&#8217;s more important than the Liberals&#8217; sharply increased <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/04/05/trudeau-transit-investment-baloney_n_15828056.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spending</a> on public transport.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/andrew-scheer/\">ANDREW SCHEER</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/andrew-scheer-election-justin-trudeau/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Andrew Scheer\u2019s Everyman image won\u2019t be enough to beat Justin Trudeau</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/ottawa-bloodsport-calling-for-morneau-to-resign/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Ottawa bloodsport: Calling for Bill Morneau to resign</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/andrew-scheer-of-the-suburbs-vs-justin-trudeau-and-his-throngs/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Andrew Scheer of the suburbs vs Justin Trudeau and his throngs</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/andrew-scheer-learns-his-jobs-no-fun/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Andrew Scheer learns his job\u2019s no fun</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/mckenna-hopes-climate-barbie-furor-brings-change-in-behaviour/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>McKenna hopes \u2018climate Barbie\u2019 furor brings change in behaviour</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/dispatches-from-the-ottawa-biography-wars/\">Dispatches from the Ottawa biography wars</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/dispatches-from-the-ottawa-biography-wars/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>6</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The Battle of Bill Morneau</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-battle-of-bill-morneau/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-battle-of-bill-morneau/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2018 09:00:04 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Bill Morneau]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Justin Trudeau]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Liberal party]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[small business tax]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1089809</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Canada\u2019s federal finance minister on his catastrophic autumn, what went wrong and how he\u2019s fighting back</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-battle-of-bill-morneau/\">The Battle of Bill Morneau</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_1089643\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-1089643 size-full\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST01.jpg\" alt=\"Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau\" width=\"822\" height=\"462\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST01.jpg 822w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST01-300x168.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST01-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST01-600x336.jpg 600w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST01-375x211.jpg 375w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST01-111x63.jpg 111w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Minister Bill Morneau announcing changes to the small business tax rate at Pastaggio Italian Eatery in Stouffville, Ont., October 16, 2017. (Adam Scotti/PMO)</p></div>\n<p>Jet Fuel Coffee on Parliament Street in Toronto is a shotgun shack, long and narrow, with almost all the action concentrated at the bar just inside the front door. Farther back there\u2019s a second room where patrons who aren\u2019t in a rush, which is almost none of them, can sip their caffeine at leisure. A man in that quiet room, facing away from the front door, can sit unnoticed for most of an hour, talking with a visitor about how his year has gone. On a recent Friday morning, that man was Bill Morneau.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo how have the last five months been?\u201d the finance minister said, repeating my question. \u201cWell, there\u2019ve been fun days.\u201d</p>\n<p>Morneau is 55, the same age Paul Martin was when he became finance minister and only two years younger than Jim Flaherty when he got the job. But even after all he\u2019s been through, he looks much younger than his predecessors, as though he could have been seconded to carry their papers. Trim, athletic and casual in a cashmere blazer as soft as butter, open-necked dress shirt and chinos, he was nursing a head cold and trying to make sense of the chaotic days since July.</p>\n<p>July was when he announced a series of changes to the tax treatment of small businesses and provoked an outburst of taxpayer wrath he didn\u2019t foresee.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, there\u2019ve absolutely been a few really frustrating periods, as you can imagine.\u201d One can indeed. By the time Parliament finally rose in mid-December, Morneau had been fined $200 by Mary Dawson, the ethics commissioner, for failing to report the corporation he had set up in France to run his private villa there. The Conservative opposition was calling for his resignation. Much of the country saw him as a rich guy launching an inexplicable attack on the plucky mom-and-pop businesses that made Canada great.</p>\n<p>How did that happen? Listening to him, it became clear Morneau hasn\u2019t entirely digested the experience. \u201cI guess I sort of look at it as two distinct things.\u201d By \u201cthings,\u201d he meant two distinct periods. An early period, fairly smooth, and a later period, pretty hellish.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE:\u00a0</strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeaus-mid-life-crisis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Justin Trudeau\u2019s mid-life crisis</strong></a></p></blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThe first thing is our introduction of the tax changes.\u201d The changes had been coming for a while. As early as the 2015 campaign, Justin Trudeau told the CBC that \u201ca large percentage of small businesses are actually just ways for wealthier Canadians to save on their taxes.\u201d He promised \u201ca little tweaking&#8230;\u2009around that.\u201d By the time Morneau delivered the 2017 budget in March, the big budget book contained half a page on the topic of \u201ctax planning using private corporations.\u201d The government would be laying out \u201cproposed policy responses soon,\u201d the budget document said.</p>\n<p>And in a May speech at the Toronto Board of Trade, Morneau sounded positively eager for what he was getting himself into. \u201cIn the coming weeks, our government intends to release a discussion paper looking at these tax planning schemes in more detail,\u201d he said then. \u201cThat\u2019s sure to create some debate. That\u2019s good. That\u2019s what I\u2019m after.\u201d</p>\n<p>So the minister and his boss had \ufb01red three warning shots, and not a lot of people had reacted at all. It looked like clear sailing. \u201cAnd then,\u201d Morneau said, \u201cwe announced the changes in July. And that actually went off quite well. People sort of accepted what we were trying to achieve. We\u2019d telegraphed it a long way in advance.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then?</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then there was just a tsunami of concerns from a collection of different constituents that, frankly, we didn\u2019t prepare for as adequately as we should have.\u201d</p>\n<p>As Morneau spoke, the sound system at Jet Fuel Coffee\u2014big, powerful speakers that make the place sound more like a nightclub than a coffee joint\u2014began playing Johnny Cash\u2019s 2002 cover of a Nine Inch Nails song. \u201cI hurt myself today, to see if I still feel; I focus on the pain, the only thing that\u2019s real.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-shepell-is-not-happy-with-morneau/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Why Shepell is not happy with Morneau</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>He had warned the Liberal caucus in June, he said, and they didn\u2019t tell him not to proceed. He told Trudeau a little later. They were on a flight somewhere. \u201cI said, \u2018We\u2019re prepared, right? Because this is going to be challenging when we do this.\u2019 And he was absolutely on board for the challenge.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then, honestly, I think what happened was, it went better than expected when we initially rolled it out.\u201d So Morneau and his staff got complacent. This is credible. Complacency has stalked this Liberal government since its election, and in some ways it\u2019s been richly earned. So many things that looked like trouble at first for Trudeau and his charges turned out not to be much trouble at all. Admitting they would run bigger deficits than they had promised in the campaign. Passing assisted-dying legislation and a reform to public pensions. Getting every province to accept a new health care funding arrangement the provinces had unanimously rejected as too miserly the first time they heard it. So many crises averted. Maybe the tax changes would be a cinch too.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd once the strong pushback came, we weren\u2019t leaning forward. And it just got away from us. And the strength of the concerns was such that it was very hard for us to get back into the discussion.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1089647\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-1089647 size-full\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST03.jpg\" alt=\"Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau with a sign that reads \u201cCutting taxes for small business\u201d\" width=\"822\" height=\"462\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST03.jpg 822w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST03-300x168.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST03-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST03-600x336.jpg 600w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST03-375x211.jpg 375w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST03-111x63.jpg 111w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Finance Minister Bill Morneau looks on as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks to members of the media at a press conference in Stouffville, Ont., on Monday, October 16, 2017. (Nathan Denette/CP)</p></div>\n<p>At times it was painful to watch. At a town hall-style listening session in Oakville, Ont., on Sept. 29, the event\u2019s nominal host, Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould, had to plead repeatedly for silence while several people in the audience heckled Morneau.</p>\n<p>Morneau ran for public office for the first time in 2015 in Toronto Centre, a riding where just about no politician ever gets a rough ride and where the winners for most of Morneau\u2019s lifetime have been a succession of clubbable Liberals\u2014Donald Macdonald, Bill Graham, Bob Rae\u2014leavened by the odd Albany Club Tory, temperamentally indistinguishable from the Liberals they replaced.</p>\n<p>He learned few political lessons on his way to Ottawa and found himself in a caucus of rookies where few of his colleagues had much to teach him. Watching video of the Oakville town hall, what\u2019s clearest is how few political chops Morneau has. You can see him deciding he needs to push back, but all that comes out of his mouth is the corporate jargon he refined into a highly lucrative art as CEO of the rapidly expanding human resources company Morneau Shepell in the \u201990s and 2000s.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will tell you that we have looked at the system and concluded that some of the dynamics in the system are not what was intended,\u201d he tells the Oakville crowd. \u201cSo\u2014\u201d Angry shouts shut him down.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hear you that some of you are not in, in, in agreement with some of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he stammers. \u201cWe are trying to listen to the impacts on businesses, to try to make sure they continue to have an incentive to invest.\u201d</p>\n<p>More shouts. A few in the crowd try to push back on Morneau\u2019s behalf. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we let the minister speak, people. You all had your opportunity!\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s have some respect.\u201d \u201cPlease let the minister speak.\u201d But the day is already pretty much a write-off.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/on-business-tax-liberals-need-to-catch-up-to-the-u-s/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">On business tax, Liberals need to catch up to the U.S.</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Seventeen days later, Morneau kicked off a series of events to announce a package of measures designed to mollify outraged small business owners: Accelerated cuts to the small-business tax rate; indexing of the Canada Child Benefit; an increase to the Working Income Tax Benefit.</p>\n<p>\u201cHindsight, now, we look back and say we should have been articulating, from the very first day, what the benefits would have been,\u201d Morneau said at Jet Fuel Coffee, summing up his experience. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t do, we didn\u2019t say to the people in this coffee shop, \u2018The reason we\u2019re doing it is because in the end this is going to allow us to do some other things.\u2019 To do the indexation of the CCB, or to do the WITB. To do the things we knew we were going to end up doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>What about the part where Pierre Poilievre, the indefatigable Conservative finance critic, spent months calling Morneau a rich guy who doesn\u2019t want to do a thing about his own advantages?</p>\n<p>\u201cThe whole discussion about my personal finances\u2014from day one, I thought this was entirely an opposition tactic,\u201d Morneau said. \u201cBut they grabbed the megaphone because it\u2019s complicated, because I didn\u2019t have a way to articulate exactly what the answer was.\u201d</p>\n<p>At about this point, Morneau plainly decided he had indulged in enough introspection. The Johnny Cash song was over.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it wasn\u2019t fun every day. But for me, honestly, you\u2019ve always got to come back and say, \u2018So why did you get into this adventure?\u2019 And I got into this adventure because I thought there were big things that I could be a part of doing. And here we are now, two years in, where the stuff we\u2019ve done, in my estimation\u2014and I think the evidence is absolutely supportive of this\u2014is having a really big impact. And frankly, even bigger, sooner, than we expected it was going to have.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d still do this. I\u2019d come back and do this again and again. It\u2019s worth it. But it\u2019s hard.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE:\u00a0</strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/ottawa-bloodsport-calling-for-morneau-to-resign/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Ottawa bloodsport: Calling for Bill Morneau to resign</strong></a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Did anyone on his staff, or in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, lean forward while he was preparing to announce all these small-business tax measures and say, \u201cHey minister, you\u2019re a rich guy, and that\u2019s going to make you a target?\u201d Did anyone tell him his biography should be a concern?</p>\n<p>\u201cI think my biography was the reason I was a candidate for the job. Think back to my biography. I\u2019m the guy who went into a family business in 1990 that had a couple of hundred employees. And who absolutely, from day one, thought about the really long term.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s true that Morneau Shepell was a far bigger \ufb01rm by the time Morneau left it than when he started. It\u2019s also true that he and his wife, Nancy McCain, heiress of the frozen-food clan, are long-time regulars on the philanthropic circuit in Toronto. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re going to be successful, which is sort of a card for doing the kind of job I\u2019m doing, what did you do with the success? Did you buy a Ferrari or did you spend your time on doing stuff that you thought was going to make a difference?\u201d</p>\n<p>So the whole thing about being rich? \u201cWe didn\u2019t sit around and say anything about this as a negative. We saw it as a positive.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s great, except the opposition saw it as a negative, and they used it to ring Morneau\u2019s bells for Q3 and Q4 of 2017. So maybe instead of reminding himself what a great life story he\u2019s lived, he could have spotted the openings it provided to his opponents.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s it like to take a question in the House of Commons, I asked. It was a leading question. Even when the questions were easier, it was clear Morneau was not a big fan of the daily 45-minute hot-seat session.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI find Question Period to be, uh, Question Period. It\u2019s more about the questioner than it is about the answers. Because clearly the opposition is trying to use it as their space to create friction, to create noise, to make it interesting for journalists as opposed to trying to illuminate an issue or really advance the cause of making the country better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sometimes he is accused of sounding bitter. He sounded like he was catching himself sounding bitter. \u201cThat\u2019s not to denigrate what the opposition is doing. That\u2019s just their role. They\u2019re the opposition. So for me, what that means is, my job is not to react in a way that adds gasoline to the fire. It\u2019s to answer the question in a respectful way, but to understand the dynamics.\u201d</p>\n<p>If their job is to create noise, they had a good fall, I said.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh really, do you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>I laughed. Morneau persisted.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, seriously, do you think? Because look at the outcome. I mean, if you look at what\u2019s happened over the course of the fall, we\u2019ve done something we said we were going to do, which is to look at some tax issues we felt were advantaging a small subset of the population. And from 30,000 feet, we\u2019re doing exactly what we said we were going to do. And the math is going to be very easy for people to understand in the budget. They\u2019re going to be able to see that the tax changes that have been made will fund the increase in the Canada Child Benefit and the Working Income Tax Benefit and the small-business tax cut. Not dollar for dollar, but very close. And I think people are going to say, \u2018Okay, now I get it.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve wasted a lot of precious time on things that are meant to distract. That\u2019s not actually helpful to them. If they\u2019re doing that because they don\u2019t have anything else to say, I don\u2019t know, it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s working. And certainly the by-election results don\u2019t suggest it\u2019s working.\u201d</p>\n<p>The results in question were from four by-elections on Dec. 11: two Liberal holds, a Conservative hold and a British Columbia seat the Liberals took from the Conservatives. Out of 12 by-elections since the 2015 elections, the only ridings to change seats were two that had been Conservative but have gone Liberal. This is the story Liberals tell themselves these days. I heard it from a backbencher on Sparks Street the day before Morneau recited it: The opposition is loud and the opinion columns are vexed, but if the people have had enough of Morneau or of the Trudeau Liberals more generally, they have a funny way of showing it.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1089645\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-1089645 size-full\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST02.jpg\" alt=\"Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\" width=\"822\" height=\"462\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST02.jpg 822w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST02-300x168.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST02-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST02-600x336.jpg 600w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST02-375x211.jpg 375w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST02-111x63.jpg 111w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Morneau and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau carry copies of the 2017 Federal Budget on Parliament Hill, March 22, 2017. (David Kawai/Bloomberg/Getty Images)</p></div>\n<p>Meanwhile, Morneau works on the next budget. His cabinet colleagues spent October sending him formal letters with their budget requests. November was devoted to evaluating those requests, along with hundreds of others from stakeholders. Morneau\u2019s first formal meeting with Trudeau to discuss the broad outline of the budget was on Dec.14, the day before I met Morneau at Jet Fuel.</p>\n<p>His main goal when he became finance minister was to increase economic growth, at more or less the precise moment\u2014now\u2014when an aging population would tend to slow growth down. So far his luck has held. \u201cI look at five indicators,\u201d Morneau said, ticking them off with his fingers. \u201cGlobal growth is better than we expected.\u201d That was one. \u201cHousing is fuelling our economy even more than we expected.\u201d Two. \u201cThe stuff we did, the Canada Child Benefit, that\u2019s still impacting the economy and we\u2019ve got disposable income growth.\u201d Three. The Canada Child Benefit was designed to be spent, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening to it, in large part. \u201cThe rebound in Alberta is going a little better than we expected.\u201d Four. \u201cAnd then obviously we\u2019ve still got stimulative interest rates.\u201d Five.</p>\n<p>Not that Morneau is getting clapped on the back by a grateful nation everywhere he goes. As we left Jet Fuel, a guy at the coffee bar grabbed Morneau\u2019s hand, shook it harder and longer than courtesy dictated, and leaned in to tell the minister something.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe wanted to take the photo for our budget cover,\u201d Morneau said ruefully once he had escaped to the sidewalk. \u201cSaid he could save us a lot of money.\u201d This was over an October story in Blacklock\u2019s Reporter, an Ottawa news website, that said Morneau\u2019s department had spent $212,234 on \u201cartistic themes\u201d for the 2017 budget. Morneau had explained that the money had gone to pay for a lot more than the budget document\u2019s cover photo. The guy at the coffee bar had not been particularly mollified. \u201cIt\u2019s funny what people remember,\u201d Morneau said.</p>\n<p>On this particular day, the theme of Morneau\u2019s pre-budget consultations was science. Morneau has been saying science will be one of the themes in his spring budget, along with improving women\u2019s economic success and preparing workers for a fast-changing job market.</p>\n<p>In some ways, with whatever they end up doing on science funding, the Liberals hope to get some natural allies off their back. Science researchers and university administrators have surprised the Trudeau government by complaining all year about stagnant funding for the big federal granting councils that pay for much of the country\u2019s basic research. Declining funding per researcher is a trend line the Liberals inherited from their Conservative predecessors, but so far they haven\u2019t done much to change it. In April, a report commissioned by Morneau\u2019s colleague Kirsty Duncan, the science minister, called for federal funding to the granting councils to increase over four years until it\u2019s $1.3 billion higher than today.</p>\n<p>The report\u2019s author was David Naylor, a glowering former president of the University of Toronto who was a national leader on higher-education issues when he led that institution. He has spent the year since April rallying support for his funding demands. The response from federal Liberals has been an elevated level of annoyance. If scientists don\u2019t love Liberals unconditionally, who will? Naylor\u2019s report is asking for a lot, one of Morneau\u2019s staffers told me later: $1.3 billion is almost as much as the total amount of new spending Morneau announced in his 2017 budget for everything the government does. (It\u2019s not an entirely fair comparison. The 2016 budget had so much new spending in it, after a Conservative decade in power, it was like a fire sale in a candy factory. The reason new spending was so low in 2017 was that the previous year\u2019s budget had already accounted for years of new spending.)</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1089649\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-1089649 size-full\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST04.jpg\" alt=\"Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau at his constituency office\" width=\"822\" height=\"516\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST04.jpg 822w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST04-300x188.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST04-768x482.jpg 768w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_MORNEAU_POST04-375x235.jpg 375w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bill Morneau having lunch with his constituency office staff. (Yasin Osman)</p></div>\n<p>But Morneau can\u2019t simply ignore a report that has backing from just about every university in the country. So after a preliminary meeting with Naylor in the autumn, he\u2019d invited him back for some follow-up. When Morneau arrived at his riding office from the caf\u00e9, Naylor was sitting in the office\u2019s compact boardroom.</p>\n<p>The two men have known each other for years. Naylor took one look at the cold-bedraggled minister. \u201cAre you sleeping as much as you used to?\u201d</p>\n<p>No, Morneau admitted.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you exercising?\u201d</p>\n<p>Not a lot, Morneau said.</p>\n<p>Naylor was a physician before he got into the administration racket. He slipped easily into his old role. \u201cYou need a routine of early-morning exercise,\u201d he admonished Morneau gently. \u201cYou need to exasperate the catecholamines and have enough fatigue built up at night so you can sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>I had agreed in advance not to report the substantive contents of the meeting, but Naylor gave Morneau a stern talking-to. At the end, Morneau thanked Naylor for his time with a chilly cordiality that made his visitor laugh out loud.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not much of a backslapper,\u201d a Morneau adviser told me later. \u201cNot much for small talk,\u201d another agreed.</p>\n<p>If anything, this makes Morneau relatively appealing among Trudeau ministers. Covering Justin Trudeau\u2019s cabinet can be like finding yourself snowed in at a ski lodge with a touring production of Up With People: the non-stop cheerfulness and five-alarm groupthink can be wearying. Morneau stands a little distant from his colleagues and, indeed, from most other people in a room. He keeps his counsel.</p>\n<p>To some extent, that introversion, with gusts to caginess, came close to ruining him in the autumn: When the time came to tell his side of a story his opponents had effectively personalized, he had no instinct for a heart-tugging yarn. But in the cockpit during the budget crunch, his detachment probably keeps him sane.</p>\n<p>By the time he delivered his first budget in 2016, he said, his cabinet colleagues\u2019 spending requests had outspent the available money by 15 to one. Last year they had it down to eight to one. This year they\u2019re still closer to making real-world requests, he said. But theirs aren\u2019t the only demands on a finance minister\u2019s purse. The Commons finance committee hears from dozens of groups. Lobbyists and professional associations have meetings with Morneau\u2019s staff all the time. In long meetings with bureaucrats from the finance department, Morneau\u2019s staff has been busy deciding which requests they can actually accommodate.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to do everything,\u201d Morneau told me, \u201cbut you can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>He will\u2014barring a truly astonishing decision by the Prime Minister to hoist him from the finance minister\u2019s job near the end of a budget cycle\u2014get his next big chance when he delivers his third budget this spring. There\u2019s no doubt that Morneau is, by now, seriously damaged political goods. But everyone gets damaged in politics at some point. It\u2019s a cruel business.

Who will ever want to run for high office again, knowing the time-honoured option of an occasional tropical getaway to the sprawling demesne of a vaguely spiritual host who periodically petitions the federal government for grants-in-kind will forever be foreclosed?</p>\n<p>I kid. Probably this sort of situation won&#8217;t come up, in precisely the same form, again. In its details, this whole thing is Byzantine in the intricacy of its silliness. Part of Mary Dawson&#8217;s ruling\u2014which she took longer to deliver than Prime Ministers Tupper, Turner, Campbell and Clark took to <em>be prime minister\u2014</em>hinges on her decision that the Aga Khan cannot be considered a &#8220;friend&#8221; of Justin Trudeau&#8217;s within the meaning of the Conflict of Interest Act. Mostly contrite in the lobby of the House of Commons, the prime minister still insisted the Aga Khan is indeed a friend.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m never good on this kind of story, so I&#8217;m still trying to figure out why it could matter. The Aga Khan&#8217;s foundation was registered to lobby with the PMO. It had benefited from government spending decisions before (including under Trudeau&#8217;s predecessor, Stephen Harper) and stood to do so again. But it would be okay for him to bestow repeated gifts on Trudeau&#8217;s family\u2014including one that becomes more precious the longer you&#8217;re in public life, which is the gift of privacy and isolation\u2014if they were demonstrably pals? The ethically prophylactic solution, I guess, is to elect leaders who maintain active friendships with the <em>largest possible number</em> of plutocrats.</p>\n<p><em>Prime Minister, where have you been?</em></p>\n<p><em>My pal Tex&#8217;s ranch! Mustn&#8217;t fall out of touch!</em></p>\n<p>But the details, while intriguing, are to some extent a distraction. They allow for all kinds of room to dodge or distract (&#8220;<em>It&#8217;s not as though the Aga Khan is a bad guy, after all</em>&#8220;). Meanwhile the general rule is simple: public officeholders should not be given, or at least they should not accept, what they could not ordinarily buy. The reason for this is that nothing is free, and if there is no dollar cost, then the debt will be the baser currency of favours owed. And, as Justin Trudeau used to <a href=\"https://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2015/11/27/open-and-accountable-government#Message_to_Ministers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">feel free to explain to his ministers</a>, it doesn&#8217;t even matter if favours are thought to be owed between the protagonists in such a drama: if a reasonable outside observer could construe the situation as to leave a debt on one side or the other, that&#8217;s enough to cast doubt on the integrity of the transaction.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/trudeau-talks-about-quality-family-time-on-the-aga-khans-island/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trudeau talks about \u2018quality family time\u2019 on the Aga Khan\u2019s island</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s tedious to have to do all this paperwork and turn down experiences that might be fun! It is a drag that bad things happened in Canada\u2014the sponsorship scandal, Karlheinz Schreiber, the deep morass of collusion in the Quebec construction industry\u2014that have led to all sorts of ethics rules and constraints and checks. But the alternative to all these ethical belts and suspenders is, precisely, a world in which &#8220;who you know in the PMO&#8221; can affect one&#8217;s chances of getting ahead.</p>\n<p>In <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>, Shakespeare has several characters muse about why it&#8217;s important to uphold transparent contract law, even if it means granting Shylock his bloody bond in his dispute with Antonio. Even Antonio, when it looks like he&#8217;ll come up on the losing end of the deal, gets it: &#8220;The duke cannot deny the course of law: For the commodity that strangers have/ With us in Venice, if it be denied,/ Will much impeach the justice of his state;/ Since that the trade and profit of the city/ Consisteth of all nations.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In other words: you can&#8217;t deny a stranger justice, because if you did, strangers from around the world would understand that this trading nation is no place to expect justice. Exactly so, in a trading nation like Canada. The <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/trump-profit-cash-presidency-maralago-753970\">collapse of our nearest neighbour and largest trading partner into an abject crony state</a>\u00a0offers competitive advantage only to the extent Canada refuses to follow suit.</p>\n<p>There are risks all over. As the Trudeau government ramps up spending on infrastructure, often involving large investors whose principals the PM likes to <a href=\"https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/the-davos-file-trudeau-s-schedule-includes-more-meetings-with-ceos-1.2746062\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cajole in person</a>, everyone will need to ensure there is no hint of back-scratching and log-rolling. The scale of the temptation is vast. As the government&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2016/02/25/prime-minister-announces-new-governor-council-appointment-process\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">open, transparent and merit-based appointment process</a>&#8221; requires thousands of Canadians to apply in person for plum government jobs\u2014actually, I&#8217;m not sure what will happen as a result of that, but there seems to be room for concern. For every senator, official, judge, board member or other public figure who&#8217;s been selected through the new process, there&#8217;ve been several more who&#8217;ve been turned down, may hope to try again, and in the meantime are conscious of themselves as petitioners for a government favour. And on a day like today, that&#8217;s worth thinking about.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/justin-trudeau/\">JUSTIN TRUDEAU</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/trudeau-talks-about-quality-family-time-on-the-aga-khans-island/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Trudeau talks about \u2018quality family time\u2019 on the Aga Khan\u2019s island</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ethics-watchdog-says-justin-trudeaus-vacation-broke-conflict-rules/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Ethics watchdog says Justin Trudeau\u2019s vacation broke conflict rules</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-tillerson-is-courting-sending-states-and-why-canada-is-one-of-them/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>How Canada fits into Rex Tillerson\u2019s plan for North Korea</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/videos/prime-minister-justin-trudeau-answers-questions-in-first-year-end-interview/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau answers questions in first year-end interview</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/justin-trudeau-on-trade-pot-and-die-hards-status-as-a-christmas-movie/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Justin Trudeau on trade, pot and Die Hard\u2019s status as a Christmas movie</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-ties-that-bind-the-liberals-and-the-bronfmans/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>The ties that bind the Liberals and the Bronfmans</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/politicians-need-to-learn-how-to-show-not-tell/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Politicians need to learn how to show, not tell</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/why-2018-is-the-year-of-the-trudeau-reset/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Why 2018 is the year of the Trudeau reset</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/friends-welcome-to-justin-trudeaus-ethical-island/\">Friends!

The courtly Quebec lawyer had been Canada&#8217;s prime minister for just over seven months when North Korean forces invaded the South, on what was, in Ottawa time, a Sunday in June, 1950.</p>\n<p>St. Laurent liked to think of himself as more activist and interventionist than his cautious predecessor, W.L. Mackenzie King, but as King&#8217;s foreign minister St. Laurent had already been whipsawed by postwar politics in Europe. There was a shattered Western Europe to rebuild after the Second World War, but the great powers elbowed Canada out of a direct administrative role in divided Berlin, and King and St. Laurent took that as their cue to bring Canada&#8217;s tired troops home. But within two years, the tightening Communist grip across Eastern Europe led to rapid re-militarization. Canada would reap no great peace dividend; Canadian troops would not be long returning to Europe, to remain for a generation.</p>\n<p>What did Korea have to do with any of this? Already Europe&#8217;s a nuclear-tipped quagmire and St. Laurent&#8217;s supposed to worry about <em>Korea</em>? He hoped the new UN Security Council would be deadlocked, as it already usually was, but the Russians were boycotting it, and soon not only the Americans but the Brits, Australians, New Zealanders and the Dutch had sent warships to the region. Canada followed suit with two destroyers (my source for most of this is the writings of Blair Fraser, one of my predecessors at this magazine).</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/worldpolitics/north-korea-vs-donald-trump-who-made-each-of-these-inflammatory-threats/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Donald Trump and North Korea\u2019s nuclear war rhetoric is frighteningly similar</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>By mid-July the invading North Koreans had pushed past their southern cousins and a not-yet-adequately-numerous line of defending Americans and overrun Seoul. The UN Secretary General called on all member states to defend South Korea. It was a Friday. St. Laurent was fishing. He finally drove in for the regular Wednesday cabinet meeting. Reporters waited for word from the meeting. St. Laurent had some. &#8220;Well, gentlemen, I hope to be fishing again by the day after tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It was August before he announced the dispatch of Canadian ground troops \u2014 a brigade that would be recruited for task, rather than assigned from regular forces. The first Canadian soldiers finally moseyed into Korea in February; the bulk of the force wouldn&#8217;t be in place until May. Canadian soldiers are often measurably more game than their leaders; these fought like hell once they&#8217;d arrived, took heavy casualties, helped push the North Koreans back and hold the line in the divided country.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>WATCH: Rex Tillerson on North Korea: &#8220;All options remain on the table&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote>\n\t\t<div class=\"bc-video bc-video-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"player-loader\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n\t\t\t<iframe src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/video/iframe/13639244001/VJjIBwmqg/5687267883001\"\n\t\t\t\twidth=\"640\"\n\t\t\t\theight=\"360\"\n\t\t\t\tallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tmozallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; right: 0px; left: 0px;\" class=\"rdm-brightcove-videojs-iframe\"></iframe>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n<p>It all seemed so distant to Canadian preoccupations, even as it was happening. Writes Fraser: &#8220;At one point the <em>Vancouver Sun</em> ran the same Korean War story on its front page for three days running, then gleefully announced that not a single reader had noticed this fact.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But for today&#8217;s purposes, perhaps what&#8217;s most germane about the Korean War is that as a matter of treaty law, it never ended. The 1953 armistice that ended the fighting was an agreement among <em>armies</em> to stop fighting, pending &#8220;a final peaceful settlement&#8221; among <em>governments</em>. That peace treaty never arrived. So <a href=\"http://www.yokota.af.mil/Units/United-Nations-Command-Rear/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">United Nations Command \u2014 Rear</a>, a base set up in Japan in the 1950s, has never been abandoned. Command at UNC-R rotates among several &#8220;sending nations,&#8221; meaning those that responded \u2014 however reluctantly! \u2014 to the UN&#8217;s call in 1950. That included Canada. The current Deputy Commander at UNC-R is Maj. Tammy Hiscock of the RCAF. I&#8217;m told there are about half a dozen Canadians over there all told.</p>\n<p>This would be merely an odd coincidence of nature, a geopolitical appendix never removed, except that North Korea keeps testing ICBMs, and the Americans have been talking \u2014 since before Donald Trump was elected, it&#8217;s worth noting \u2014 about &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/back-focus-united-nations-command-south-korea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">revitalizing</a>&#8221; the United Nations Command and the mandate and responsibilities of the &#8220;sending nations.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/north-koreas-latest-nuclear-tremors-felt-in-canada/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Should Canada help in North Korean standoff?</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s <em>really interesting</em> that on Nov. 28, after the most recent and potentially destabilizing North Korean missile test, Rex Tillerson, the U.S. Secretary of State, <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2017/11/276019.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> a meeting &#8220;in partnership with Canada&#8221; of &#8220;the United Nations Command Sending States.&#8221; It takes a little detective work to find a current list of sending states; it seems to include\u00a0Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, Philippines, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</p>\n<p>This is, of course, all handy background for Tillerson&#8217;s Ottawa visit on Tuesday, when he&#8217;ll meet Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. I drag you through all this diplomatic history, first, because it makes interesting reading, and also because it&#8217;s germane to the day&#8217;s events. Germane but not determinative: It would be fun if I could claim that a 64-year-old treaty locks Canada into the next chapter of land war in Asia, but there are two problems with that story.</p>\n<p>First, this isn&#8217;t World War I; no old signature locks Canada into anything. But it does provide a <em>basis</em> for Canadian involvement, a reason if not a requirement, and that&#8217;s handy because Rex Tillerson, at least, is still trying to <em>avoid</em> a war in, around or over Korea. As he put it in his own communiqu\u00e9 invoking the &#8220;Command Sending States,&#8221; &#8220;Diplomatic options remain viable and open, for now.&#8221; Tillerson rather famously <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-contradicts-tillerson-on-north-korea-the-latest-in-a-series-of-put-downs/2017/10/01/1f11f886-a6bb-11e7-92d1-58c702d2d975_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">differs</a> from his boss, Donald Trump, on this question, and there&#8217;s been speculation it could cost Tillerson his job. This would be a serious problem for, among billions of other people, Chrystia Freeland, whose most important regular U.S. interlocutor is Tillerson. But in the meantime, Tillerson is interested in Canada, not for the trivially modest contributions it could make to a very nasty shooting war, but to the potentially greater contributions it might make to avoiding one.</p>\n<p>Again over the public objections of his doofus boss, Tillerson has been trying to lure the North Korean regime into serious talk over alternatives to the current brinksmanship. This is a long shot: direct public talks involving Americans and North Koreans haven&#8217;t happened since the so-called six-party talks collapsed in 2009. Who could lure them back? Maybe Canada. Or maybe not. But maybe. We would at least be a fresh face, and Trudeau&#8217;s good relations with the Cuban regime might help. It&#8217;s worth a try. The alternatives to talking are nasty.</p>\n<p>Unlike St. Laurent, Justin Trudeau will tend to see North Korea as a welcome diversion from other issues. First, because Canada would not, at this stage, be getting dragged into a fiercely kinetic ground combat, but seeking to avoid that or far worse. Second, because progress against (or with) North Korea would be a way of reasserting Canadian good faith on an issue that, policy options aside, preoccupies both the U.S. president and his Secretary of State. A reminder for all concerned, the president first among them, that Canada can be a source of solutions, not just problems.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/north-korea/\">NORTH KOREA</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-tillerson-is-courting-sending-states-and-why-canada-is-one-of-them/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Why Tillerson is courting \u2018sending states.\u2019 And why Canada is one of them.</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/worldpolitics/north-korea-vs-donald-trump-who-made-each-of-these-inflammatory-threats/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Donald Trump and North Korea\u2019s nuclear war rhetoric is frighteningly similar</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/u-s-nuclear-commander-says-any-illegal-trump-orders-will-be-resisted/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>U.S. nuclear commander says any \u2018illegal\u2019 Trump orders will be resisted</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/the-real-challenge-america-faces-in-east-asias-new-geopolitical-game/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>The real challenge America faces in East Asia\u2019s new geopolitical game</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/how-trumps-asia-trip-is-another-crucial-test-for-his-presidency/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>How Trump\u2019s Asia trip is another crucial test for his presidency</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/on-foreign-policy-trump-and-trudeau-are-feckless-birds-of-a-feather/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>On foreign policy, Trump and Trudeau are birds of a feather</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/trump-calls-negotiation-efforts-with-north-korea-a-waste-of-time/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Trump calls negotiation efforts with North Korea a waste of time</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/u-s-flies-bomber-fighter-mission-off-coast-of-north-korea/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>U.S. flies bomber, fighter mission off coast of North Korea</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-tillerson-is-courting-sending-states-and-why-canada-is-one-of-them/\">How Canada fits into Rex Tillerson&#8217;s plan for North Korea</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-tillerson-is-courting-sending-states-and-why-canada-is-one-of-them/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>13</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Bonjour!

The province&#8217;s premier, the softspoken and deeply tactical Robert Bourassa, had brought in legislation to re-assert some elements of Bill 101 that had been struck down by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>Because the new law used the Charter of Rights&#8217; &#8220;notwithstanding&#8221; clause to establish the predominance of French over English on signs, it made Montreal&#8217;s anglophones as angry as hell. Because it <del>permitted English on signs </del>[UPDATE: No, that didn&#8217;t happen until another law in 1993, I&#8217;m reminded]\u00a0, it made francophone nationalists about as mad. Because the whole country was mainlining adrenaline over an ambitious constitutional reform package called the Meech Lake accord (I feel like I should explain that now, but this is already the longest anecdote lede in history; basically, it seemed like the only thing worth arguing about in 1989), the emotions stirred up by Bourassa&#8217;s legislation were intense. It would become clear later that the backlash against Bourassa&#8217;s language laws had contributed to the eventual collapse of the Meech Lake amendments and, through a circuitous route, to the harrowing 1995 sovereignty referendum.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I was a kid from Sarnia. I wasn&#8217;t sure I got any of this. &#8220;What&#8217;s it like living through all of this language strife?&#8221; I asked <em>The Gazette</em>&#8216;s city editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If we weren&#8217;t covering it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you wouldn&#8217;t know it was going on.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/quebec-without-equalization/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quebec without equalization?</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>This is the thing about language politics in Montreal. It&#8217;s a game with many participants but few spectators. It&#8217;s addictive fun to play and unbearable to watch. If you&#8217;re not arguing about the state of the fragile equilibrium\u2014standoff? Cold war?\u2014between the local francophone majority and the continental anglophone majority, then you&#8217;re just living your life. And living your life is almost always <em>very different</em> from whatever the current argument is about.</p>\n<p>The latest argument is so stupid I have avoided it for a week. Probably you have heard anyway. Quebec&#8217;s National Assembly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/world/canada/bonjour-hi-quebec.html\">passed a unanimous resolution urging merchants to greet customers with a hearty &#8220;bonjour!&#8221;</a>\u00a0 The unstated subtext was that they should stop there and not add an incriminating &#8220;Hi!&#8221; in English. In fact, in the motion&#8217;s original wording, as presented by the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lis\u00e9e, it wasn&#8217;t even unstated. The frequent use of &#8220;Bonjour-hi&#8221; by Montreal merchants was described as an &#8220;irritant,&#8221; until Quebec premier Philippe Couillard sat down with Lis\u00e9e and haggled over the motion, line by line, eventually removing the bit about &#8220;hi&#8221; being an irritant.</p>\n<p>Thus amended\u2014essentially, <em>Say &#8216;bonjour!&#8217; to customers, because the English language is&#8230; well, you know\u2014</em>the motion was adapted unanimously by the National Assembly.</p>\n<p>Unanimous motions of the National Assembly are believed, by its members and by about three staffers at<em> Le Devoir</em>, to carry a particular weight, because they mark occasions when the representatives of the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois nation put aside their differences to speak with one voice in sacred defence of the besieged descendants of France on American soil. Unfortunately, the rush of passing such a motion must be intense to the point of addiction because for many years now, the members of the National Assembly have been passing so many that by now the effect is ruined.</p>\n<p>Here is <a href=\"https://www.sqrc.gouv.qc.ca/relations-canadiennes/positions-historiques/motions-assemblee-nationale.asp\">a <em>partial</em> list of unanimous motions going back to 1960</a>, including 15 so far this year alone. Five in November. On Nov. 14, the representatives of the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois nation put aside their differences long enough to demand a share of federal subsidies for electric-car recharging stations proportional to Quebec&#8217;s share of Canada-wide electric car sales. Come on. I&#8217;m a big fan of the National Assembly, but these days, it&#8217;s precisely at its most solemn moments that it&#8217;s the biggest farce.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/quebec-motion-calls-on-store-clerks-to-drop-english-greetings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quebec motion calls on store clerks to drop English greetings</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s this motion from a perpetual-motion motion factory that urges people to say <em>bonjour</em> and to stop right there. Three responses are possible. You could ignore it; you could see a germ of wisdom in it; or you could view it as a slap in the face. Most people have chosen the first response. Advocates of the latter two positions, unfortunately, buy ink by the barrel. Let&#8217;s consider those responses in turn.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s actually easy, for anyone who&#8217;s spent any time in Quebec in the last half-century, to understand why some people are leery about creeping anglicization: if it ever crept too far it would leave no room for French as the living common language of what even Stephen Harper recognized as a distinct nation. When I lived in Montreal, and it&#8217;s 23 years since I left, this concern was obvious <em>to most anglophones</em>, especially those my age or younger. It&#8217;s why younger Montrealers of any background were usually highly fluent in French, comfortable among francophones, happy to be greeted in any language.</p>\n<p>It does seem to me that some of this spirit of <em>bonne entente</em> has faded in recent years. It&#8217;s only an impression, but these days it seems that anglos in Montreal mostly just keep anglo-ing. Is it arrogance? Fatigue at being told, in a hundred ways, that no matter how much they conform, they&#8217;ll never be francophone enough? Maybe both. But the defence of French in Quebec has <em>always</em> been a defence against English\u2014and yet Quebec has also remained home to a lot of anglophones who understand they can still live very well in the midst of that fight, because it&#8217;s never a total war.</p>\n<p>As for the notion that <em>bonjour</em>-but-not-hi is an affront to the very existence of non-francophone Quebecers, well, sure it is, if you want to be that way. In the battle to keep French alive in this corner of North America, <em>bonjour</em>-hi is the tiniest conceivable molehill to die on. But precisely so: surely in such a trivial skirmish, it shouldn&#8217;t be hard to rise above the fray. The National Assembly&#8217;s preferred greeting will be ignored by most Quebecers. Those who do stop at <em>bonjour</em> will not, surely in most cases, be prejudicing the language of the next word anyone speaks. It&#8217;s easy to imagine a conversation that goes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Merchant: <em>Bonjour!</em></p>\n<p>Customer: <em>Bonjour!</em> [Pause] Do you have quarter-inch screws?</p>\n<p>Merchant: Yeah, they&#8217;re in aisle three.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Everyone who&#8217;s spent time in Quebec and who has even rudimentary French has lived through a thousand variations on that conversation. The long talks in French between anglophone strangers who haven&#8217;t yet caught each other&#8217;s English accent. The negotiations with someone whose first language is neither English nor French, while each of you wonders which of the two, or a third, would make everything run more smoothly. Repeated interactions with the same merchant or lover or landlord, in French when you&#8217;re peppy, in English when you&#8217;re lazy. My French is good; most times when I run into Philippe Couillard or Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lis\u00e9e, they greet me in English anyway. Most of the time, Montreal is Ground Zero of the proverbial Canada that works in practice but not in theory. Not even the National Assembly, in all its unanimous wisdom, can fix or wreck any of that.</p>\n<p>If, by the way, the National Assembly or any other defender of the French language feels like being useful, they can recall that one way to defend the French language is to speak it eloquently, write it with passion and lift up its most elegant practitioners. On that score, French was rather better defended when Lucien Bouchard was the province&#8217;s premier than it will be if Fran\u00e7ois Legault, to whom the construction <em>Ce dont on parle</em> seems as alien as Klingon, becomes his next successor.</p>\n<p>And to the extent that each of us imperfect vessels is, by adulthood, mostly a lost cause when it comes to improving the state of the language we speak and write, the National Assembly might want to busy itself by figuring out ways to help future generations make Quebec French, with its gorgeous accents and idioms, more often some of the best French in the world. Essay contests, public-speaking tournaments, visits by the finest young writers to the National Assembly to be toasted by the representatives of the nation. You don&#8217;t lift a language up by putting another down. Or not only.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/quebec/\">QUEBEC</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/quebec-motion-calls-on-store-clerks-to-drop-english-greetings/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Quebec motion calls on store clerks to drop English greetings</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/quebec-without-equalization/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Quebec without equalization?</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/trudeau-weighing-options-on-bill-62-after-court-challenge/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Trudeau weighing options on Bill 62 after court challenge</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/controversial-quebec-face-covering-law-faces-court-challenge/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Controversial Quebec face covering law faces court challenge</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/an-americans-view-of-quebec/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Adam Miller\u2019s \u2018Quebec\u2019: An American\u2019s view of La belle province</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/opinion-bill-62-is-what-islamophobia-looks-like/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Opinion: Bill 62 is what Islamophobia looks like</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-quebecs-bill-62-is-an-indefensible-mess/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Why Quebec\u2019s Bill 62 is an indefensible mess</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/quebec-face-covering-ban-likely-to-face-supreme-court-challenge/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Quebec face-covering ban likely to face Supreme Court challenge</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/bonjour-hi-let-us-discuss-language-politics/\">Bonjour!

The results <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-10/canadian-views-on-china-trade-talks-clouded-by-legal-concerns\" target=\"_blank\">did get reported</a>, by the redoubtable Josh Wingrove at Bloomberg, when they came out, but they&#8217;re worth another look.</p>\n<p>The consultations, with more than 400 business groups and a decent number of civil-society organizations and individuals, in every province and the Northwest Territories, seems admirably thorough. The reported results, of course, are whatever the government felt like reporting, but they don&#8217;t read as a whitewash. To me they suggest Canadians are interested in closer trade ties with China\u2014but not at any price. Canadians want access to the Chinese market if it&#8217;s real access, not if they&#8217;re stymied at every turn. Those Canadians who have any experience doing business in China have had a lot of experience with the feeling of being stymied at every turn. They&#8217;re not interested in more of that feeling.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0&#8220;Stakeholders throughout the country conveyed that one of the greatest obstacles they face in doing business with China is an unpredictable and opaque regulatory environment,&#8221; the report says. &#8220;We heard about the experience of Canadian business in facing different customs procedures depending on their port of entry, and about regulatory requirements being changed without any notice.&#8221; </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>READ MORE:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/worldpolitics/why-canadians-need-to-start-worrying-about-china/\" target=\"_blank\">Why Canadians need to start worrying about China</a></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What&#8217;s to be done? Appeals to good faith haven&#8217;t worked, and legal remedies often don&#8217;t either.

Think about the implications: Is China even able to deliver an open market?)</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Is intellectual property safe in China? Canada&#8217;s traders don&#8217;t think so. &#8220;China is still not providing the enforcement and remedial awards needed to ensure the protection of IP rights.&#8221; Hence the &#8220;crucial importance&#8221; of &#8220;a robust and effective dispute settlement mechanism.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">What&#8217;s the cost of cracking that huge tough market? The groups consulted &#8220;<span class=\"s1\">expressed concerns that increased engagement with China could lead Canada to compromise on its values.&#8221; They mentioned\u00a0</span><span class=\"s1\">China\u2019s &#8220;lax labour standards, lower environmental requirements, state-driven subsidization of production, export subsidies, Chinese overcapacity, and the dumping of Chinese products on international markets.&#8221; Without\u00a0&#8220;meaningful&#8221; measures to address those concerns, stakeholders told the government a trade deal &#8220;would only result in a hollowing-out of Canadian manufacturing and increased job displacement.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">What would we export if we got a deal? Trudeau government officials used to wax lyrical about the burgeoning Chinese market for clean tech, but it&#8217;s becoming increasingly obvious that China plans to feed that market through domestic supply. In Canada, meanwhile, while &#8220;reactions from Canada\u2019s agriculture stakeholders were especially supportive of a prospective FTA with China,&#8221; companies that export manufactured goods said it&#8217;s a shell game: &#8220;<span class=\"s1\">issues affecting trade in goods for Canadian businesses in China include inconsistent technical regulations and standards&#8230; S</span><span class=\"s1\">takeholders expressed frustration with the frequency of changes to Chinese regulations, which are often difficult to identify, and are sometimes applied differently across various jurisdictions within China.&#8221;\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Meanwhile, there were persistent concerns about the kind of regime we&#8217;d be trading with. &#8220;Stakeholders raised concerns related to China\u2019s domestic human rights record, specifically with regard to Tibet and other ethnic and religious minority groups, the respect for the freedoms of speech and assembly, and the treatment of political dissidents, journalists, and lawyers.&#8221; Of course, as we&#8217;re frequently reminded, the China regime is not fond of hearing such concerns. &#8220;</span><span class=\"s1\">Some stakeholders expressed concern that a decision to negotiate an FTA could have a chilling effect on the Government of Canada\u2019s willingness to raise sensitive issues related to human rights with China.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Those are the costs of getting into the Chinese market. Meanwhile Chinese companies would be getting further into the Canadian market. &#8220;Chinese investments in Canadian real estate markets have contributed to higher real estate prices, which has benefited some owners, but have also had a variety of negative impacts on several communities. In farm communities, properties have been acquired and then left unattended&#8230; Similarly, commercial properties owned by absentee landlords are sometimes boarded up, leaving once vibrant communities with hollowed-out commercial centres.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Justin Trudeau is sometimes portrayed, especially in his foreign-policy adventures, as a <a href=\"http://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/trudeaus-trade-deal-with-china-turns-into-an-embarrassment\" target=\"_blank\">creature of pure whimsy</a>, wandering into the halls of power, checking out his debonair reflection in every mirror, scowling as an aide whispers in his ear to remind him which country he&#8217;s in, what day it is, and what&#8217;s drawn on his socks. That&#8217;s not easy to square with a government that held 70 round-table discussions during this consultation round, and 17 days of face-to-face meetings between lower-level Canadian and Chinese trade delegations in only the last year.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It&#8217;s easier to suspect that Trudeau has heard from each of those processes that the two will be hard to reconcile. From the exploratory talks, he&#8217;ll have been told that China wants a standard deal of the sort it&#8217;s worked out many times before: China has, after all, a <a href=\"http://fta.mofcom.gov.cn/english/fta_qianshu.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">dozen free-trade deals</a> inked, 10 more under active negotiation and another 10 under consideration, including with Canada. From the consultations, he&#8217;ll have heard that a lot of Canadians figure a standard deal won&#8217;t help them and, incidentally, it won&#8217;t help the Chinese people either.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The pressure on labour standards, human rights and market access\u00a0don&#8217;t come from some Trudeauvian progressive whimsy; they come from the calculations of Canadians who trade for a living about what kind of deal is worth having. The gap between that deal and the one that&#8217;s on offer is the sort of thing a prime minister might fly to Beijing to try to close. We are often lectured, when a PM goes to China, about the expectations the Chinese have from such meetings. Turns out Canadians have some too.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/justin-trudeau/\">JUSTIN TRUDEAU</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeaus-apology-to-lgbtq2-canadians/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Justin Trudeau\u2019s apology to LGBTQ2 Canadians</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-conservative-roots-of-public-apologies/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The conservative roots of public apologies</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/realestateeconomy/markets-and-not-national-strategies-will-make-housing-affordable/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Markets, not national strategies, will make housing affordable</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/canada-braces-for-a-trump-visit-in-2018/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Canada braces for a Trump visit in 2018</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/trudeaus-lgbtq-apology-is-a-good-start-but-its-not-enough/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Trudeau\u2019s LGBTQ apology is a good start, but it\u2019s not enough</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/trudeaus-lgbt-apology-and-the-sacrifices-that-made-it-possible/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Trudeau\u2019s LGBT apology and the sacrifices that made it possible</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-trudeau-will-be-his-best-advertisement-and-worst-enemy-in-2018/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Why Trudeau will be his best advertisement\u2014and worst enemy\u2014in 2018</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/trudeau-tries-to-thread-the-china-needle/\">Trudeau tries to thread the China needle</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/trudeau-tries-to-thread-the-china-needle/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>8</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>A peacekeeping force on the Russia-Ukraine border?</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/a-peacekeeping-force-on-the-russia-ukraine-border/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/a-peacekeeping-force-on-the-russia-ukraine-border/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2017 00:07:59 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Chrystia Freeland]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Peacekeeping]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Russia]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ukraine]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Vladimir Putin]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1081271</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Paul Wells on how a long shot mission hinging on a retreat by Vladimir Putin is taking shape, and how Canada is playing a role</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/a-peacekeeping-force-on-the-russia-ukraine-border/\">A peacekeeping force on the Russia-Ukraine border?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_897821\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MAC30_CANADIAN_FORCES_POST02.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-897821\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-897821\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MAC30_CANADIAN_FORCES_POST02.jpg\" alt=\"Canadian Army instructors discuss mechanized infantry defence tactics with their Ukrainian Armed Forces colleagues during Exercise RAPID TRIDENT in Starychi, Ukraine on June 30, 2016.

(Joint Task Force Ukraine)</p></div>\n<p>The strangest thing began to happen this autumn: signs of Canadian support for an international peacekeeping mission in Eastern Ukraine.</p>\n<p>In September, during a visit by Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-poroshenko-ukraine-peacekeeping-1.4303831\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> &#8220;there is definitely a very strong potential role&#8221; for peacekeepers, nearly four years into a Russian invasion and occupation of the country&#8217;s eastern regions.</p>\n<p>In November Andrew Scheer, the leader of the official opposition, <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/scheer-joins-calls-for-trudeau-government-to-spearhead-un-peacekeeping-mission-in-ukraine/article36888716/\" target=\"_blank\">called for</a> an international force to patrol the Ukraine-Russia border. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/11/09/no-promises-but-lots-of-talk-about-canadian-peacekeepers-in-ukraine.html\" target=\"_blank\">responded</a> with openness to the call.</p>\n<p>All of which was confusing to some Ukraine watchers. Russian president Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/explainer-putin-ukraine-peacekeepers-donbas-poroshenko/28720342.html\" target=\"_blank\">suggested</a> an international force in the region in early September. But he wanted troops along the &#8220;demarcation line&#8221; separating Ukrainian army regulars from Russia-backed separatists in Luhansk and Donetsk. A force deployed in such a way\u00a0would essentially freeze the conflict in its tracks, granting Russia part marks for an invasion and occupation the Western world rejects as illegitimate, and durably destabilizing the Ukrainian government.</p>\n<p>Trudeau, Scheer and Sajjan insist any force must be deployed at the border between Russia and Ukraine. Isn&#8217;t that wishful thinking? As analysts have <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/peacekeeping-ukraine-canada-russia-1.4306593\" target=\"_blank\">pointed out</a>, permitting peacekeepers on the border would amount to a capitulation by Putin. He isn&#8217;t normally the capitulating type.</p>\n<p>But senior Canadian and U.S. government sources tell <em>Maclean&#8217;s</em> that a recent flurry of Western diplomatic activity is predicated on the suspicion that Putin may indeed be looking for a way out of his Ukrainian adventure.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>RELATED:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/donald-trump-putins-manchurian-idiot/\" target=\"_blank\">Donald Trump: Putin\u2019s Manchurian Idiot</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;What Russia wants is a more friendly government in Kiev,&#8221; Kurt Volker, the U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine, told <em>Maclean&#8217;s</em> in a telephone interview. &#8220;They want a Ukraine that sees itself as connected to Russia. But by invading and taking this territory they\u2019ve produced the opposite: they\u2019ve produced a more unified, more nationalist, more anti-Russian, more pro-Western Ukraine. So they\u2019re actually producing the opposite of what they called for. Which is why they might be willing to rethink. &#8221;</p>\n<p>In case a Russian rethink is on the way, Western diplomats have held a steady succession of low-profile meetings to prepare for some kind of multilateral troop deployment. One person who&#8217;s been busy on the file is Chrystia Freeland, Canada&#8217;s foreign minister, who has family roots in Ukraine and who studied and worked there nearly 30 years ago.</p>\n<p>At\u00a0their first meeting in February,\u00a0Freeland and\u00a0Rex Tillerson, the U.S. Secretary of State,\u00a0discussed Ukraine. The same month, both Trudeau and Freeland discussed Ukraine with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin. Merkel asked Canada to play a bigger role\u00a0on Ukraine. Freeland has met frequently with Germany&#8217;s ambassador to the United Nations, Christoph Heusgen, who was Merkel&#8217;s national security advisor and who has kept responsibility for Ukraine since taking up his new role.</p>\n<p>At Canada&#8217;s High Commission in London, Freeland had dinner with Pavlo Klimkin, Ukraine&#8217;s foreign minister, and with their Latvian and Lithuanian counterparts,\u00a0Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds and\u00a0Linas Linkevi\u010dius.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Canada&#8217;s role increased still further when Poroshenko visited Toronto for the Invictus Games and held his joint media availability with Trudeau. Five weeks later Ukraine&#8217;s prime minister, Volodymyr Groysman, was in Ottawa and Toronto. He was a guest for dinner at Freeland&#8217;s Toronto residence, along with the author and <em>Washington Post</em> columnist Anne Applebaum; the Ukrainian ambassador to Canada, Andriy Shevchenko; and Canada&#8217;s ambassador to Ukraine, Roman Waschuk, who like Freeland speaks Ukrainian.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It&#8217;s a lot of planning for something that may never happen\u2014something that seems, as of today, unlikely to happen: a\u00a0retreat\u00a0by Vladimir Putin on his most high-profile foreign-policy intervention, unless you count the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\u00a0Putin and Western leaders are not talking about the same sort of stabilization force in the same place. Nothing can happen until they agree on terms.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;A peacekeeping force that helps to solve the problem in the Donbas will do its job, and will be acceptable to Canada, only if those peacekeepers are at the Ukrainian border,&#8221; Freeland said in an interview with <em>Maclean&#8217;s</em>. &#8220;It is absolutely essential in this process that Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity be affirmed and recognized. That\u2019s the key to the whole issue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Why, having annexed Crimea and sent troops into the eastern Donbas region, would Putin reverse course? &#8220;It\u2019s really a strategic decision for Russia,&#8221; Volker, the U.S. envoy, said. &#8220;Do they want to get out, try to portray President Putin as a peacemaker, take credit for getting special status, and get on the path for sanctions relief? These are things they could sell.&#8221;</p>\n<p>(Note that all of this discussion relates only to the presence of Russians and surrogates in the Eastern region of Donbas. Russia&#8217;s annexation of Crimea is another question: Still rejected by Western governments as an illegal Russian adventure, but unlikely to be unwound by sanctions or any other mechanism any time soon. &#8220;Never say never,&#8221; a Canadian source said, but Crimea is likely to remain under Russian control for some time to come.)</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Russia is heading for a presidential election in the spring, and Putin has always run for office &#8220;on the basis of an assertive nationalism, defending Russian-speaking people wherever they may be against perceived threats from the outside world,&#8221; Volker said. &#8220;And\u00a0he could very well do so again. So I can\u2019t say how\u00a0he&#8217;ll come down on this, but I think there\u2019s an opportunity\u2026even in the context of elections.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Volker said Putin&#8217;s expectations for an easy and successful subjugation of Ukraine may be conditioned by the pretty easy time he had of things after Russia invaded Georgia in 2008. &#8220;They saw that the West kind of walked away after six months. We didn\u2019t put in place any sanctions. We hit this big red reset button&#8221;\u2014literally, in the form of a toy prop former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton used to symbolize a new relationship with Russia after Barack Obama was elected President. &#8220;There was no lasting penalty to Russia for having invaded Georgia,&#8221; Volker said.</p>\n<p>Putin might have expected a Ukraine would be a comparable walk in the park. Instead he got united Western condemnations, sanctions that have hurt and held, and the collapse of pro-Russian sentiment in Ukrainian politics. And suddenly he&#8217;s talking about peacekeeping. Just not, yet, where his adversaries want it.</p>\n<p>Volker has had three meetings with his designated Russian interlocutor, Kremlin envoy Vladislav Surkov. Their <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/volker-surkov-ukraine-russia-un-peacekeeping-force/28850546.html\" target=\"_blank\">most recent meeting</a> was in Belgrade in early October. Their earlier meetings, in Minsk in August and Belgrade in September, were encouraging, Volker said. &#8220;It felt like we were exchanging views on how we could actually keep a peacekeeping force. It seemed like we were making some progress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Volker&#8217;s latest meeting with Surkov, however, &#8220;felt like a step backwards,&#8221; Volker said. &#8220;We have very different concepts now.&#8221; Surkov&#8217;s includes no access for a hypothetical new peacekeeping force to\u00a0Ukraine&#8217;s border with Russia. &#8220;That\u2019s critically important as well, because without controlling the inflow and outflows of people and arms, you\u2019re really not going to be able to secure the area,&#8221; Volker said. &#8220;So Russia took a step back on that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If they change their minds, soften up, decide to make some concessions to a lousy outcome in Ukraine and consent to a multinational force with jurisdiction all the way to the border, who would lead it? Probably not Canada. It&#8217;s a NATO country, it has troops in Latvia bolstering the alliance&#8217;s eastern frontier, and there&#8217;s not much Putin likes less than NATO. It would take another country, one that gets along well with NATO but isn&#8217;t a member, ideally one with a centuries-long history of alliances with Ukraine. Sweden is such a country. Volker was in Stockholm earlier this month. And two weeks ago in Toronto, Freeland welcomed another visitor, former Swedish prime minister and foreign minister Carl Bildt.

(Adam Scotti/PMO)</p></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s standard operating <span class=\"s1\">procedure when predicting an entire year\u2019s worth of politics in advance to protest that it can\u2019t be done. The ritual incantations are many: if a week\u2019s a long time in politics, then a year\u2019s an eternity. Events, dear boy, events. And so on.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Yet for all his supposed dynamism, what\u2019s striking about Justin Trudeau at the dawn of 2018 is how closely his prospects and pitfalls resemble what he faced at the dawn of 2017. The surprise with this Prime Minister is that he is becoming a known quantity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Here\u2019s a <i>Toronto Star</i> headline from Jan. 7: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/01/07/justin-trudeau-tries-to-find-his-populist-voice-paul-wells.html\">Justin Trudeau tries to shake air of entitlement</a>.\u201d A year later, he\u2019s still shaking. Another January headline: \u201c<a href=\"http://Trudeau\u2019s Trump tactics seem to be working \u2014 so far: Paul Wells\">Trudeau\u2019s Trump tactics seem to be working\u2014so far.</a>\u201d Still true, so far. A year ago, we didn\u2019t even know which party leaders Trudeau would face at the next election. Now we know, but it doesn\u2019t help: Andrew Scheer and Jagmeet Singh have made hardly any progress imprinting their personalities and projects onto the national psyche.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The likeliest outcome from 2018, then, is that Justin Trudeau will continue to be his own best advertisement\u2014and worst enemy. By the end of the year ahead, Canada will be in the long approach to an election in the fall of 2019. Campaigns are about opponents giving the gears to incumbents, but it\u2019s hard to imagine Trudeau\u2019s opponents doing damage to him on a scale approaching the damage he routinely does to himself.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">So 2018 will be a \ufb01ght between Trudeau and Trudeau. Let\u2019s sketch a portrait of the Trudeau who could be hard to beat in 2019, before describing the Trudeau who could be surprisingly vulnerable by then.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">On the bright side: the Prime Minister continues to bring formidable energy and organizational chops to his big tasks. He won the 2015 debates by outpreparing his adversaries. He responded to Donald Trump\u2019s election in similar fashion, by flooding the zone. Trudeau accomplished what several prime ministers always meant to do, identifying and motivating the most elaborate network of pro-Canadian contacts any Canadian government has ever pieced together on American soil. He has put most of his cabinet, much of his Liberal caucus and even some erstwhile opponents\u2014Conservative icons like Brian Mulroney and Rona Ambrose, the normally adversarial Saskatchewan premier Brad Wall\u2014to work making the case for the NAFTA trade deal, and for Canada more generally, south of the border. He has kept up his warm personal relationship with Trump even as his government has moved aggressively to position Canada as a better home for talent and investment than the United States.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/andrew-scheer-of-the-suburbs-vs-justin-trudeau-and-his-throngs/\">Andrew Scheer of the suburbs vs Justin Trudeau and his throngs</a></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\">Whether any of this activity neutralizes Trump as an economic threat is a question only time can answer. But it was probably worth doing anyway: someday, when the great republic to the south is under less mercurial executive leadership, it\u2019ll be handy to have all of Canada\u2019s friends on one contact list.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Meanwhile, Canada\u2019s economy is growing nicely. Alberta is rebounding from the worst job losses of the oil crash. Quebec is a relative growth tiger amid the general good news, which helps ensure that separatist sentiment is so low it\u2019s hard to measure.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">By the new year, one of Trudeau\u2019s biggest projects, the Canada Infrastructure Bank, should be connecting the world\u2019s biggest institutional investors to very large projects to build Canadian roads, bridges, rail networks and power grids. If the bank works, it\u2019ll mean billions of dollars injected into an already robust economy, in highly visible ways. Meanwhile, new visa rules are making it easier for tech \ufb01rms to attract international talent, leading several companies to announce of\ufb01ce expansions in Vancouver and Toronto.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Trudeau\u2019s early moves on what are sometimes called identity politics are lately looking prescient. The women who comprise half of his cabinet are at least as impressive, on average, as the men who constitute the other half. Trudeau\u2019s gender-parity advocacy\u2014in international development, trade and the military\u2014is mentioned by other world leaders as often as his other economic measures. The zero-tolerance policy that has led to four Liberal MPs leaving the caucus over assorted accusations of personal misconduct seems, in retrospect, to have put the Trudeau Liberals ahead of a societal curve, given recent debates over sexual harassment and misconduct in the workplace.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The Senate, which was rattled when Trudeau kicked every Liberal senator out of his party\u2019s national caucus, is reconstituting itself as an august debating society whose independent-minded new members sometimes forget to support the government. So far it\u2019s at least arguable that the changes Trudeau wrought have improved the place.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">That\u2019s a tidy suite of stories an incumbent government can look forward to telling about itself on the campaign trail. And if in the end none of it saves Trudeau\u2019s bacon, it will be because he has already sown the seeds of a very different competing narrative.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Start with that Senate: the new Trudeau-appointed \u201cindependents\u201d are actually pretty Liberal, voting most of the time for policies favoured by the Prime Minister to whom each of them had to apply for a job. But not all of them and not all the time. That\u2019s made the Senate the most unpredictable place in Ottawa. Soon enough, some of its members will delay or block crucial legislation, derailing Trudeau\u2019s attempt to deliver on a major commitment. For a while in the spring it looked like it would be the infrastructure bank. These days it\u2019s cannabis legalization.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1079783\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1079783\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MAC12_TRUDEAUS_FUTURE_POST02.jpg\" alt=\"Trudeau\u2019s efforts to position himself as a champion of the middle class have been somewhat undermined by his privileged background (Adam Scotti/PMO)\" width=\"822\" height=\"462\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MAC12_TRUDEAUS_FUTURE_POST02.jpg 822w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MAC12_TRUDEAUS_FUTURE_POST02-300x168.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MAC12_TRUDEAUS_FUTURE_POST02-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MAC12_TRUDEAUS_FUTURE_POST02-600x336.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trudeau\u2019s efforts to position himself as a champion of the middle class have been somewhat undermined by his privileged background. (Adam Scotti/PMO)</p></div>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s not a rebellious spirit that is making the Senate a dangerous place for Liberal projects, merely the unaccustomed outbreak of intellectual curiosity. In June, the upper house came within a vote of considering the infrastructure bank separately from the rest of Bill Morneau\u2019s 2017 budget, a move that could have delayed the proposed bank\u2019s creation. Andr\u00e9 Pratte, a Trudeau-appointed former <i>La Presse</i> editorialist, wanted the proposed bank studied in more detail. Every Conservative lined up with him, plus a handful of other independents and independent-minded Liberals. That\u2019s the sort of odd geometry that comes into play on vote after vote in the new Senate. There will surely be further chaos in the year ahead.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">That matters because Trudeau really needs to deliver results on big \ufb01les. If the infrastructure bank is a dud, the energy expended to get it up and running will be hard to explain. What could make it a dud? Perhaps the creeping suspicion among big global investors\u2014fed in part by the infernal dif\ufb01culty oil companies have had getting pipelines built\u2014that Canada is a nice place where nobody ever actually makes a decision.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">If drinking water doesn\u2019t get measurably cleaner in Indigenous communities, or the Phoenix pay system can\u2019t work out the bugs, or the Liberals make it through an entire electoral mandate without buying a single serious piece of military equipment, it\u2019ll be all the harder to take \u201cmanagerial competence\u201d back to the voters and ask for a re\ufb01ll on the mandate. None of these outcomes is a long shot. In fact, it\u2019s starting to look like all three chronic problems are likelier to get worse than better in the next two years.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Trudeau\u2019s relatively smooth ride on federal-provincial relations will be tested in 2018 too. Elections, in Ontario in June and Quebec in October, will threaten two dependable Trudeau allies, Kathleen Wynne and Philippe Couillard. Both have been trailing opposition parties in recent polls. The biggest threat to Couillard comes from Fran\u00e7ois Legault of the upstart Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec, a centre-right party whose leader is cheerfully incurious about the rest of the country and whose reflexes on most intergovernmental \ufb01les would be fundamentally unpredictable.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In Alberta, there\u2019s no election until 2019, but to beat Jason Kenney, the new leader of the (re-)United Conservative Party, NDP Premier Rachel Notley may \ufb01nd herself forced to behave more like him, picking \ufb01ghts with Ottawa over natural resources. So the PM will \ufb01nd himself running short of allies in a year when a lot of his big projects\u2014legalizing cannabis, stitching together a nationwide carbon plan\u2014will require some amount of civility in federal-provincial relations.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>MORE:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeaus-mid-life-crisis/\">Justin Trudeau\u2019s mid-life crisis</a></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Complicating all of this is Trudeau\u2019s increasingly obvious tin ear on questions of class and wealth. It\u2019s worth remembering that the unending calvary of Finance Minister Bill Morneau began on territory the Liberals chose and believed they could work to their advantage: tax fairness. \u201cWe need to make sure that everyone\u2019s pulling their weight and doing their fair share,\u201d Trudeau told <i>Maclean\u2019s</i> in a Canada Day interview only weeks before Morneau announced the small-business tax changes that erupted into months of crisis for the government.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Suddenly it\u2019s not obvious why Trudeau thought a manicured plutocrat like Morneau would be a credible champion of the middle class. It\u2019s not clear why he turned to Stephen Bronfman, scion of Canada\u2019s most legendary rich family, to raise money for the Liberals. And it\u2019s far from clear that he understands that every time he talks about \u201cvalues\u201d and the \u201cmiddle class,\u201d he comes closer to hurting his case than to helping it.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The Justin Trudeau of early 2017 could have warned him, if only the Justin Trudeau of mid-2017 had been in a mood to listen. In a February speech to a fancy dinner in Hamburg, Germany, he warned that governments risk voter wrath if they don\u2019t take the preoccupations of ordinary voters seriously. \u201cWhen governments serve special interests instead of the citizens\u2019 interests who elected them, people lose faith,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re watching that anxiety transform into anger on an almost daily basis.\u201d Boy, I\u2019ll say.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">So 2018 for Trudeau looks like one endless headache\u2014the NAFTA talks\u2014and an existential question. Can Trudeau recover the image of vigour, decisiveness and empathy that won him a healthy majority in 2015? Or will he seem increasingly out of touch with the ordinary Canadians he claims to champion?</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>MORE ABOUT <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/justin-trudeau/\">JUSTIN TRUDEAU</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/science-in-canada-needs-funding-not-photo-ops/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Science in Canada needs funding, not photo-ops</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/justin-trudeau-is-getting-cocky-about-the-economy-watch-out/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Justin Trudeau is getting cocky about the economy.

One leader sets the agenda, the others react. It actually doesn&#8217;t matter much who&#8217;s right on the facts: what matters is who&#8217;s making everyone dance.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday in Quebec politics, that person was Fran\u00e7ois Legault, the leader of the Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec party (shortened everywhere as CAQ, pronounced\u00a0&#8220;cack.&#8221; I don&#8217;t make it up, I just report it). In Question Period,\u00a0Legault was making the best of things, going\u00a0after Premier Philippe Couillard for\u00a0the previous day&#8217;s actually quite rosy fall economic update. Federal equalization payments to Quebec have tripled since 2003, Legault said, to more than $11 billion. Isn&#8217;t it a shame?</p>\n<p>Then Legault uncorked the following: &#8220;What I want to tell Quebecers is that a CAQ government will aim for zero equalization. A CAQ government will eliminate the wealth gap with the rest of Canada. A CAQ government will have ambition, will aim high for Quebec.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/canadas-jobless-rate-slides-to-6-3/\" target=\"_blank\">Quebec\u2019s unemployment rate is lower than any time since the 1976 Olympics</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Couillard&#8217;s first response was to mock Legault for even imagining a CAQ government, for indeed Quebec\u00a0has never had one. The CAQ was formed in 2011, usually wanders listlessly among mutually contradictory policies, and generally looks like a reasonable idea to a reasonable number of Quebecers until the actual voting day arrives, scaring\u00a0them back to one of the more old-line parties.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s getting hot for Couillard. The CAQ won a Liberal seat in a recent by-election, and a <a href=\"http://blog.qc125.com/2017/10/nouveau-sondage-legerle-devoir-la-caq.html\" target=\"_blank\">poll</a> shows Legault&#8217;s party ahead of the Liberals.

How&#8217;s he going to eliminate equalization payments to Quebec? &#8220;What&#8217;s he going to do, precisely?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Then Couillard suggested these questions are part of a general change in his own attitude toward Legault&#8217;s party. &#8220;Until now, \u00a0he&#8217;s had it easy,&#8221; the premier said. &#8220;They say whatever they want, they change their mind three times a day, and that&#8217;s all for the day. Starting now, we&#8217;re going to answer everything they say.&#8221;<span id=\"more-1079241\"></span></p>\n<p>On his way out of the National Assembly, Couillard gave Legault 24 hours to show how he&#8217;ll arrange things so that Quebec doesn&#8217;t need more than $11 billion in net payments from the federal government. Then he repeated the challenge on Twitter,\u00a0\u00a0saying, &#8220;I give Fran\u00e7ois Legault 24 hours to explain to Quebecers how he will eliminate equalization in Quebec in 4 years, with numbers to support his argument.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\">\n<p lang=\"fr\" dir=\"ltr\">Je donne 24h <a href=\"https://twitter.com/francoislegault?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@francoislegault</a> pour expliquer aux Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois et aux Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises comment il va \u00e9liminer la p\u00e9r\u00e9quation au <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Qu%C3%A9bec?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Qu\u00e9bec</a> en 4 ans, chiffres \u00e0 l\u2019appui!\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PolQc?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PolQc</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Philippe Couillard (@phcouillard) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phcouillard/status/933370596993445888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 22, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Not quite\u00a0an ultimatum, I guess, because there&#8217;s no &#8220;or else.&#8221; Show us your numbers or&#8230; don&#8217;t?</p>\n<p>In his own tweet in reply, Legault opted for the second choice.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\">\n<p lang=\"fr\" dir=\"ltr\">Il faut premi\u00e8rement un objectif et une volont\u00e9 pour y arriver.

His reply was characteristic: it was long, unrealistic, and nobody had asked for it.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1079399\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Lisee.png\" alt=\"Lisee\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Lisee.png 500w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Lisee-300x229.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>You get out of equalization, Lis\u00e9e said, by cutting health care and education, boosting Quebec&#8217;s GDP spectacularly, or by &#8220;attaining independence and finally abolishing the grave deficit in productive federal investment in Quebec.&#8221; One of the more interesting things about this intervention is that Lis\u00e9e isn&#8217;t even offering an independence referendum during the (profoundly hypothetical) first term of a PQ government. So the PQ leader has turned into one of these guys who suggests things on Twitter he doesn&#8217;t even plan to do.</p>\n<p>For observers outside Quebec, all of this is a reminder that, contrary to rest-of-Canadian myth, nobody in Quebec is having a good chuckle over the scale of equalization payments to the province. Because equalization is received by provinces whose economies underperform, the program is a bit embarrassing for most Quebec politicians. And because Quebec, while not the poorest &#8220;have-not&#8221; province, is the largest by population, it&#8217;s by far the largest recipient of equalization. This\u00a0makes Quebec a political target, one Alberta&#8217;s new opposition leader <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/3846646/jason-kenney-promises-referendum-on-equalization-payments-if-feds-continue-to-push-carbon-tax/\" target=\"_blank\">hasn&#8217;t been shy about mentioning</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/for-jason-kenney-and-brian-jean-its-alberta-versus-the-world/\" target=\"_blank\">For Jason Kenney and Brian Jean, it\u2019s Alberta versus the world</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s clever of Legault to &#8220;aim for zero equalization.&#8221; It&#8217;s the same as championing an economy on fire. It&#8217;s also\u00a0not realistic. By most measures, Quebec&#8217;s economy is already on fire\u2014it was &#8220;<a href=\"http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/from-the-doghouse-to-a-powerhouse-quebecs-economy-has-rebounded\" target=\"_blank\">raining money</a>&#8221; this summer, though growth should <a href=\"http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/west-is-best-canadas-two-western-most-provinces-to-lead-economic-growth-this-year-and-next-659297653.html\" target=\"_blank\">slow to a drizzle</a> by next year\u2014and equalization payments to Quebec have <a href=\"https://www.fin.gc.ca/fedprov/mtp-eng.asp\" target=\"_blank\">increased</a> lately anyway.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re probably headed for at least a year of equalization debates anyway, which nobody would wish on their worst enemy, so I&#8217;ll avoid details for now. What strikes me, from the parochial perspective of an old Montreal <em>Gazette</em> reporter, is that dynamic we saw in Quebec City this morning. Couillard&#8217;s right: Legault is saying random things he can&#8217;t possibly mean. But Legault was leading the parade today, with the premier and the leader of a larger opposition party trying to squeeze into the frame. He must be pleased with his day. It&#8217;s the sort of day that improves\u00a0his chances of replacing Couillard.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/francois-legault/\">FRANCOIS LEGAULT</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/quebec-debate-2/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Shake, rattle, roll</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/quebec-political-leaders-gear-up-for-first-televised-debate/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Quebec political leaders gear up for first televised debate</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/education/uniandcollege/two-tier-tuition-massage-ad-at-memorial-prayer-spaces/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Two-tier tuition, massage ad at Memorial &amp; prayer spaces</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/the-pq-has-lost-its-monopoly-over-sovereignty/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>PQ has lost monopoly over sovereignty</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/a-shocking-night/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The future of Quebec and Canada: all bets are off</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/education/uniandcollege/quebec-students-sue-25-universities-and-colleges/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Quebec students sue 25 universities and colleges</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/francois-legault-trying-to-close-the-deal/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Fran\u00e7ois Legault, trying to close the deal</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/education/uniandcollege/quebec-students-could-block-classes-monday/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Quebec students could block classes Monday</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/quebec-without-equalization/\">Quebec without equalization?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/quebec-without-equalization/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>6</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Joe Biden: Hope, unchanged</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/joe-biden-hope-unchanged/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/joe-biden-hope-unchanged/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 15 Nov 2017 00:04:06 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Washington]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Barack Obama]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Beau Biden]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[books]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Joe Biden]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1077421</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Paul Wells on the launch of  the former vice president's 'American Promise Tour'\u2014an exercise in grieving and the start of a presidential run</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/joe-biden-hope-unchanged/\">Joe Biden: Hope, unchanged</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_1077475\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1077475\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/biden2.jpg\" alt=\"Dr. Jill Biden and Vice President Joe Biden wave after speaking to delegates during the third day session of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Wednesday, July 27, 2016.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)</p></div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Here\u2019s Joe Biden mourning his dead son. Here\u2019s Joe Biden running for president. I can\u2019t tell the difference. Can you?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">By the time the 47th Vice President of the United States of America strode onstage at the David Geffen Hall at Lincoln Center in New York City on Monday evening, the launch of his 16-city American Promise Tour was already reminiscent of a major political party\u2019s presidential nominating convention.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">First came the video highlighting the candidate\u2019s\u2014sorry, I mean the retired 74-year-old\u2019s\u2014career accomplishments, artfully interwoven with high-profile endorsements. \u201cIf you can\u2019t admire Joe Biden as a person,\u201d Barack Obama says in one clip, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d Their shouts of approval suggested just about the entire Lincoln Center crowd agreed. Surely even in this polarized American hour, most Americans do too. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Then Biden\u2019s wife Jill marched out to a lectern at stage left. Suddenly the evening diverged from the convention script. \u201cIt\u2019s been tough,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cBut you all carried us when I thought we couldn\u2019t go on.\u201d She thanked assorted Biden children and grandchildren for supporting the family patriarch as he wrote the slim book that had been distributed to each audience member once they had cleared the venue\u2019s metal detectors.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThis was a hard story to tell, and one he had to get right,\u201d she said. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The book in question is <em>Promise Me Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship and Purpose</em>, released Tuesday. It\u2019s Biden\u2019s account of the year his son Beau Biden died of cancer. A quick read suggests it\u2019s a genuinely affecting tale of a father\u2019s worst nightmare. But it\u2019s more than that, or it\u2019s simultaneously that and something else entirely.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/barack-obama-surprises-vp-joe-biden-with-medal-of-freedom/\" target=\"_blank\">Barack Obama surprises VP Joe Biden with Medal of Freedom</a></span></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At the end of the book, in early 2016, Biden decides against a third run for the presidency, after unsuccessful attempts in 1988 and 2008. It\u2019s a wrenching decision. This time he would have run from the best possible launch position, as the vice-president of a popular president. He would have been fulfilling a dying wish of his son, a popular Delaware state politician who would, Biden feels sure, have run for president himself one day. As the book ends, its author has said nothing definitive about his future. He has already suggested he\u2019s revisiting his decision. Three days before Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, Biden told an interviewer that in 2020, \u201cI\u2019ll run if I can walk.\u201d It\u2019s a big if. He\u2019ll be 78 on inauguration day in 2021. It would make him by far his country\u2019s oldest president, older by nearly eight years than Trump, who was older by a year at his inauguration than Ronald Reagan.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So what, precisely, was the near-capacity crowd at Geffen Hall there to do? Meditate on grief or rally around a champion?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Wearing a navy suit and looking hale, Biden plunked himself down in one of two plush chairs at centre stage. Stephen Colbert, the television talk-show host, took the other. Colbert does not like to keep an audience guessing about whether he likes an interview subject. \u201cI just want to say that, you know, people love Joe Biden,\u201d Colbert said. The audience roared its agreement. Colbert continued: \u201cAnd Joe Biden loves people!\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The next hour of conversation, while not scripted, covered a lot of ground briskly and in orderly fashion. What\u2019s he been up to? Biden mentioned new Biden Institutes at the Universities of Pennsylvania, for foreign affairs, and Delaware, for domestic policy (delighted squeals from Quaker and Blue Hen alumni in the crowd). He said he\u2019s still trying to help researchers cure cancer.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Does he miss politics? \u201cI do. I enjoyed politics. I enjoyed being a senator.\u201d </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What\u2019s the book about? \u201cIt\u2019s basically to find purpose,\u201d Biden said. When you\u2019re dealt a crushing blow like the death of an adult child, you need a reason to go on. Biden asked the audience how many of them have had similar losses. Hundreds of hands went up.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou know,\u201d Biden said. \u201cYou know. You\u2019ve got to find purpose.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He\u2019d poured himself into writing the book. \u201cIt surprised me. I didn\u2019t realize how much I\u2019d put out of my mind\u2014that I didn\u2019t want to remember.\u201d He\u2019d repeat something he remembered Beau saying to his other son, Hunter. \u201cDad, Beau couldn\u2019t say that,\u201d Hunter would reply. \u201cHis throat was full of tubes.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Biden\u2019s first wife and daughter died in an automobile crash in 1972. Writing the new book \u201creminded me how long it took to deal with it the first time.\u201d </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The book\u2019s title is a line from one of their last conversations. \u201cI\u2019ll be all right,\u201d Beau had told him. The Bidens are a big Catholic family. \u201cBut promise me, Dad, that you\u2019ll be all right.\u201d Biden took this as an admonition to resist the urge toward introversion\u2014to \u201cstay engaged\u201d instead.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Colbert spotted a cue for a pivot. How, he asked, has writing the book affected Biden\u2019s sense of purpose? \u201cWell, it\u2019s intensified it,\u201d Biden said. And with that Biden was clear of the precincts of grief and free to romp more or less uninhibited in the sunlit uplands of political commentary.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1077471\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1077471\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/biden.jpg\" alt=\"Vice President Joe Biden talks to people as he checks out the stage at Wells Fargo Arena before the start of the second day session of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Tuesday, July 26, 2016.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya)</p></div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Does anything in today\u2019s U.S. politics give him hope? Why, yes it does, and he began by listing two Republicans. \u201cStart with my friend John McCain,\u201d Biden said. He added \u201ca guy who\u2019s probably not getting enough credit,\u201d Republican senator Jeff Flake, who\u2019s already announced he won\u2019t run again and is serving out his term as a persistent Trump critic. This was deft. In a country whose politics often seem to have degenerated into a war of all against all, here was a Democrat naming two nominal opponents when asked for heroes. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Who else did Biden want to compliment and, by implication, associate himself with? The military. \u201cThey do it every single day.\u201d Millennials. (Millennials?) \u201cThe most open, the most engaged, the most tolerant generation in American history.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">By this point Colbert was sailing one lob after another right over the plate. What advice might Biden have for discouraged voters? Turned out he had advice! \u201cFolks. Folks. There\u2019s nowhere to hide.\u201d A call to service. \u201cYou can\u2019t build a wall high enough to make the environment cleaner. You are diminished when your sister can\u2019t marry the woman she loves.\u201d </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Trump presidency is not a joke anymore, he said. \u201cWhat started out as bemusing or somewhat distasteful\u2014people are now genuinely worried about the fate of our democratic system.\u201d At this, Colbert\u2019s hand drifted slowly upward like a shy student\u2019s. The crowd laughed. Biden ignored the distraction. He was just getting wound up.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">America has all the attributes of a great country, he said, mentioning natural resources and \u201cresearch universities\u201d and\u2014and\u2014and \u201cventure capitalists.\u201d \u201cWhat drives me crazy is that we\u2019re squandering it right now. We\u2019re squandering it. And you think you\u2019re tired? Get up. Just get up.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There was a detour into autobiography-as-credential-setting. What was it like working with Obama? \u201cWhen he gave me authority, I had absolute authority,\u201d he said. \u201cI was calling the shots.\u201d Once at a senior staff meeting, someone had put a question about Iraq to the president. He\u2019d pointed at his veep, all casual, just like that: \u201cJoe gets Iraq.\u201d The Obamas and the Bidens were super-close. Still are. He\u2019d talked to the ex-president on that very day. His granddaughter Maisy \u201cis Sasha\u2019s best friend in the world.\u201d The two families weren\u2019t just friends. \u201cIt became a family. But it\u2019s because the value set is the same. The value set.\u201d </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Does he talk to his successor, Mike Pence? Sure he does. Would he rather see a President Pence than a President Trump? \u201cI\u2019d rather see a President Clinton.\u201d</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/joe-biden-at-the-dnc-americans-have-never-ever-let-the-country-down/\">Joe Biden\u2019s speech to the 2016 Democratic National Convention</a></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Colbert, no fool: \u201cOr a President Biden?\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Biden just sat there, smiling sheepishly, while the crowd applauded and offered its endorsements. \u201cWe need you, Joe!\u201d a guy behind me shouted.

Colbert asked about Bernie Sanders. \u201cBernie struck a chord that is consequential,\u201d Biden allowed listlessly. \u201cLook, the income inequality in this country is unsustainable.\u201d It was the first time in more than an hour he had mentioned income inequality. Sanders can effortlessly regale a crowd for an hour on the theme. The mutual incomprehension between the Democrats\u2019 Sanders wing and its establishment wing remains complete.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Biden has to know this talk about who might run for his party in 2020 contains in it the germ of the end of his own dream. Three years out, it\u2019s impossible to know who\u2019ll run, or who the party will want. In 1999 I visited the Iowa Republican Straw Poll, an entertaining event on a state fairground that served as the unofficial kickoff for the next year\u2019s presidential election campaign festivities. George W. Bush was there, but he was only one of several candidates getting a serious look from the state\u2019s GOP base. Lamar Alexander, who\u2019d put a scare into Bob Dole in 1996, was there. Dan Quayle, who\u2019d once been a vice president and who still thought that meant something he could benefit from. Elizabeth Dole, whose walk-and-talk on the floor of the<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span>1996 San Diego Republican convention had briefly outshone her own husband\u2019s candidacy. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Each of them had walked through fire to get this far. Each had a dream and at least the rough foundation of a reason to believe. None but one made it to the big desk in the Oval Office. A lingering sense of justice and decency has left millions of Americans feeling that fate owes Joe Biden something. But fate is cruel, as perhaps only a man on a speaking tour about his own son\u2019s death can understand.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Maybe Joe Biden will run again. He might even win. Stranger things have happened. On Nov. 8, 2016, that sentence became authorized for use in any discussion of presidential politics, lo unto the end of days. For now, Biden is a reminder that politics can be redemptive\u2014or that it is, at least, permitted to wish it could be.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>MORE ABOUT <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/joe-biden/\">JOE BIDEN</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/rebuking-trump-biden-warns-against-backsliding-on-democracy/\">Biden warns Trump will cause democracy backslide</a></strong></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/biden-canada-trudeau/\">Canada an ally the U.S. needs more than ever: Biden</a></strong></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/joe-biden-says-he-will-not-run-for-president-in-2016/\">Joe Biden says he will not run for president in 2016</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/joe-biden-hope-unchanged/\">Joe Biden: Hope, unchanged</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/joe-biden-hope-unchanged/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>15</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Garnett Genuis: The 2017 Parliamentarian of the Year</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/garnett-genuis-poty-2017/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2017 00:50:36 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Garnett Genuis]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Parliamentarians of the Year 2017]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1074609</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Of the 10 recipients of the prize since its inception, Genuis is, by more than a decade, the youngest</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/garnett-genuis-poty-2017/\">Garnett Genuis: The 2017 Parliamentarian of the Year</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_1073971\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1073971\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MAC11_POTY_Garrett-Genuis_POST01.jpg\" alt=\"Garnett Genuis.

(Photograph by Chris Roussakis)</p></div>\n<p>Garnett Genuis is no ordinary Parliamentarian of the Year.</p>\n<p>Of the 10 recipients of the prize since its inception, he is, by more than a decade, the youngest. He has the least parliamentary experience\u2014like nearly 200 other MPs, he was elected for the first time in the bumper rookie crop of 2015. He has the lowest rank in his party\u2019s hierarchy: where previous recipients were cabinet ministers, senior critics and even leaders of their parties, Genuis, a 30-year-old Conservative from the Edmonton-area riding of Sherwood Park-Fort Saskatchewan, is his party\u2019s deputy critic for foreign affairs.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"http://macleans.ca/tag/parliamentarians-of-the-year-2017/\">Check out the rest of our 2017 parliamentarians of the year!</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Yet Genuis is his colleagues\u2019 choice for this year\u2019s top honour, their pick for Parliamentarian of the Year. And it\u2019s not just his Conservative colleagues: he also won a plurality among MPs who voted outside their party, which means he\u2019s the consensus pick of Liberals and New Democrats for the top post.</p>\n<p>How\u2019d that happen?</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had great debates in the House and he\u2019s a really good guy,\u201d said Raj Grewal, the Liberal MP for Brampton East. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the smartest MPs in the House. If he puts forward an argument, you\u2019d better be well prepared to debate with facts.\u201d And, only two years into his Commons career, Genuis is a fixture in debate. \u201cI\u2019ve never given a speech in the House when Garnett hasn\u2019t asked me a question,\u201d Grewal said. \u201cAnd I speak a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>But not as much as Genuis speaks. This year\u2019s Parliamentarian of the Year takes his role as a parliamentarian seriously: only one other MP, Kevin Lamoureux (Liberal, Winnipeg North) has spoken more words than Genuis in this Parliament. He\u2019s spoken almost three times as much on the Commons floor as Justin Trudeau.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love the work I do,\u201d Genuis said in an interview, \u201cand I think that by and large the tools are there for you to make a difference. Sometimes the tools are underutilized. But if we have a too-powerful executive, it\u2019s often just a question of \u2018Are the tools that exist for members being used or not?\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p>What kind of dusty old tool is a speech in the Commons? Ah, but Genuis makes modern use of his. He offered a comparison with Ken Epp, a former Canadian Alliance MP who last served in Parliament in 2004, when Genuis was in high school. Epp was a legendary talker during Commons debates, \u201cbut people in the riding didn\u2019t necessarily see that unless they were watching CPAC at that moment,\u201d Genuis said.</p>\n<p>By contrast, Genuis and his staff are constantly editing video of his interventions, posting them to YouTube or Facebook. A speech Genuis gave on carbon taxes (he\u2019s against) was viewed more than 100,000 times on Facebook.</p>\n<p>So it\u2019s this level of engagement, old-fashioned work ethic and modern approach that\u2019s made Genuis one of the most prominent members of this Parliament. Add his ability to get along with colleagues and seek common ground (\u201cI nicknamed him \u2018Part-Time NDP,\u2019 \u201d the NDP\u2019s foreign-affairs critic H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Laverdi\u00e8re said; Genuis winced when I passed the compliment along) and you have a parliamentarian who\u2019ll make a difference for years to come.</p>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    var

sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Ryan Remiorz/CP)</p></div>\n<p>For a guy whose staff says\u00a0he has foresworn any comment on his successor, Stephen Harper is turning into a bit of a chatty Kathy. First, during the heady days in July when it\u00a0seemed Conservatives would campaign relentlessly against\u00a0Justin Trudeau&#8217;s out-of-court settlement with Omar Khadr, Harper <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/in-the-khadr-settlement-the-conservatives-find-their-fight/\" target=\"_blank\">wrote on his Facebook page</a> that the settlement was &#8220;simply wrong.&#8221; Now, Harper has <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/harper-to-trudeau-canada-is-napping-on-nafta/\" target=\"_blank\">penned a mem</a><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/harper-to-trudeau-canada-is-napping-on-nafta/\" target=\"_blank\">o</a> asserting that just about everything the Trudeau government is doing in NAFTA negotiations is a strategic catastrophe.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at his claims. But first, let&#8217;s dispense with two red herrings.</p>\n<p>First, the Trudeau Liberals skipped straight to questioning Harper&#8217;s patriotism. A PMO staffer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CameronAhmad/status/924058873341734913\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted</a> that Harper &#8220;would rather side with US, abandon Cdn values, jobs and interests.&#8221; This is a familiar dodge. &#8220;At this crucial moment, Canada needs unity,&#8221; says everyone who&#8217;d rather avoid a debate, ever. In fact, Canada can stand a debate on anything, at any time: not only is that what democracy looks like, it was also pretty robustly demonstrated when we got <em>into</em> the free trade game with the United States, thanks to <em>two</em> knock-down, drag out elections on the matter, in 1911 and 1988. In the latter contest, the Liberals were the ones carping about government policy, as one or two of today&#8217;s older cabinet ministers may recall. Sauce for the goose is perfectly legitimate comment for the gander.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>RELATED:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/stephen-harpers-no-good-advice-on-nafta/\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen Harper\u2019s no-good advice on NAFTA</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Second, since Harper&#8217;s memo was written only for clients of his consulting firm, it could perhaps be protested that he didn&#8217;t intend for it to become public. This is not credible. In politics he routinely had staffers write &#8220;private&#8221; correspondence that magically found its way into media hands, which in fact was the point of the exercise. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether that was his intent this time around; he of all people should have known it could happen.</p>\n<p>On to the former prime minister&#8217;s argument. First, as Canadian Press reporter Alex Panetta reports, Harper &#8220;suggests Canada has been too quick in rejecting American proposals as a &#8216;red line,&#8217; or &#8216;poison pill.&#8217; He said such knee-jerk refusals are only a viable strategy if you truly believe Trump cannot cancel NAFTA \u2014 an assessment Harper does not share.&#8221; Panetta quotes some trademark weary-eyed realism from the former PM: &#8220;Canada\u2019s government needs to get its head around this reality: it does not matter whether current American proposals are worse than what we have now. What matters in evaluating them is whether it is worth having a trade agreement with the Americans or not.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s true! A substantially degraded deal\u00a0could, conceivably, indeed be better than none. But it&#8217;s odd to suggest the Trudeau government imagines NAFTA is un-killable. They talk about Trump cancelling it <em>all the time</em>. Some\u00a0of the &#8220;poison pills&#8221; Chrystia Freeland has identified do look eminently survivable: one of them is U.S. demands for a relaxing of supply management for dairy and poultry products, a sacred overpriced cow of Canadian agriculture that nobody will miss five years after some brave government\u00a0finally gives it the heave-ho. But you know who defended supply management tooth and nail during the Canada-EU and TPP trade rounds? Stephen Harper is who.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/its-time-for-the-conservatives-to-abandon-dairy-cow-marxism/\" target=\"_blank\">It\u2019s time for Conservatives to ditch dairy cow Marxism</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, some of the so-called poison pills really would put into question the worth of a trade agreement if they were accepted. Chief among these is a constant, eternal, five-year series of sunset clauses by which the deal would automatically collapse if any party decided not to renew it. That&#8217;s the same as not having a trade deal. Trade deals exist to buy stability and predictability in trading arrangements. A deal without stability is like a bucket with a hole in the bottom, good perhaps for firewood but not for the things you usually ask from a bucket.</p>\n<p>Incidentally: Know where the term &#8220;poison pill&#8221; comes from, in the NAFTA context? From <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/trade-nafta/u-s-chamber-warns-u-s-demands-could-torpedo-nafta-talks-idUKL2N1ML02O\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Donahue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce</a>.\u00a0\u201cThere are several poison pill proposals still on the table that could doom the entire deal,\u201d Donahue said in an early-October speech. \u201cAll of these proposals are unnecessary and unacceptable.\u201d</p>\n<p>And finally: What would Harper have the Canadian bargaining position be? In the absence of red lines drawn in public, apparently he would have the Canadian negotiating team tell the Americans, again in public: &#8220;We have no bottom line. We will not walk away from the table at any point, for any reason, because we&#8217;re pretty desperate for a deal.&#8221; I admit I was home sick the day they taught trade strategy at school, but on the face of it this doesn&#8217;t seem like a super bargaining stance.</p>\n<p>Harper&#8217;s second worry is that Canada has tied itself too closely to Mexico, which is, in the world of the wall-building Trump, maybe barely a shade better than partnering with Hillary Clinton. &#8220;In fact, the U.S. is both irked and mystified by the Liberals&#8217; unwavering devotion to Mexico.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A few reactions are possible. One, epidermal: You know what? Canada is irked and mystified by crisis talks over a trade deal that has been overwhelmingly a boon to this country. Life is full of irk and mystery. Suck it up.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>WATCH:\u00a0Trudeau avoids direct response to Harper\u2019s NAFTA critique</strong></p></blockquote>\n\t\t<div class=\"bc-video bc-video-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"player-loader\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n\t\t\t<iframe src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/video/iframe/13639244001/VJjIBwmqg/5630481957001\"\n\t\t\t\twidth=\"640\"\n\t\t\t\theight=\"360\"\n\t\t\t\tallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tmozallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; right: 0px; left: 0px;\" class=\"rdm-brightcove-videojs-iframe\"></iframe>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n<p>A second reaction, more reasoned: NAFTA is designed and has richly evolved as a three-party deal. The departure of any partner would involve costly disentanglement of integrated economies among all three. Mexico&#8217;s tariff wall is high and would suddenly be raised against Canadian goods. And the bilateral fallback, the Canada-U.S. FTA of 1988, is lousy by modern standards. And finally, as a reader pointed out to me on Twitter, for as long as Canada can keep Mexico onside, the Congressional NAFTA coalition will include members from states with heavy trade exposure to Mexico as well as Canada. Broad parliamentary coalitions used to be a Harper specialty.</p>\n<p>The third reaction is that this is a familiar tune from Harper. Safe communities were a top-line objective of his government, from both a policy and branding perspective; he viewed Mexico almost exclusively as a problem. He told his counterpart Felipe Calder\u00f3n in 2009 he was imposing visas, <del>out of nowhere during a phone call on another subject </del>[<em>UPDATE: My source for that was on the Mexican side; since this article was posted, it&#8217;s been disputed by someone on the Canadian side, who says there was plenty of groundwork for the call. &#8211; pw</em>]. He cancelled the last two rotating &#8220;three amigos&#8221; summits, with the Mexican and U.S. presidents, that would have been held on Canadian soil. A former Harper\u00a0government staffer wrote to me in mid-2016, after Harper had left office, to explain why: Harper was &#8220;concerned that past Liberal governments, especially [Paul] Martin, had traded away a long-standing successful and unique bilateral relationship for some photo-ops.&#8221; Martin had, in this view, &#8220;joined with a country we have limited shared interests [with] but who the\u00a0U.S. has significant security, immigration and trade problems with, and now parts of our relationship were being lumped in with theirs and dealt with through this lens, and it was having practical\u00a0negative impacts.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So all the practical reasons for keeping NAFTA talks a three-member affair, if possible, for as long as possible\u2014trade integration, tariff risks, the lousy bilateral Canada-U.S. alternative, and U.S. coalition-building considerations\u2014mean nothing to Harper, because he&#8217;s worried about what the neighbours will think. This is a fair calculation. But it&#8217;s not the only conceivable calculation. And throughout Harper&#8217;s memo, as reported by Panetta, there&#8217;s another familiar feature of Harper&#8217;s thinking as a political strategist outside government: an inability to imagine that somebody else might simply have a different playbook.</p>\n<p>Hence Harper&#8217;s shame\u2014the word seems\u00a0precise\u2014at the spectacle of a Canadian government bringing demands to the table that the Americans didn&#8217;t bring. These are the famous four horsemen of the lefty-NAFTA apocalypse, the Trudeau-proposed Indigenous, labour, environmental and gender chapters. Never mind that labour and environmental side agreements featured in the NAFTA lexicon as early as 1993, or that Donald Trump has actually shown fitful interest (the only kind this president can offer) in labour and gender issues. No, Harper is aghast: &#8220;Did anyone really think that the Liberals could somehow force the Trump administration into enacting their agenda\u2014union power, climate change, aboriginal claims, gender issues? But while the Canadian government was doing that, the Americans have been laying down their real demands.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/the-nafta-talks-should-stick-to-helping-consumers-and-taxpayers-not-pet-clauses/\" target=\"_blank\">NAFTA talks should stick to helping consumers and taxpayers, not pet clauses</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>No report from the actual negotiating sessions has said that any of the four chapters Harper mentions has been met with substantive American concern. The sticking points are all elsewhere. So maybe Trudeau might get away with some of his demands. And if not, I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s\u00a0unwise to walk into a negotiation with demands you can afford to see rejected. In a give-and-take, easy\u00a0gives are not a self-evidently bad idea.</p>\n<p>But what&#8217;s most striking about Harper&#8217;s memo is that its attitude is so familiar. I don&#8217;t know everything about Harper, but in researching two books about him I did not find any example of him praising a contemporary prime minister who wasn&#8217;t himself. This was especially true if the Canadian prime minister found himself in conflict with an American.</p>\n<p>When Ronald Reagan died, Harper called him &#8220;the Churchill of his era&#8230; an inspiration to us all.&#8221; When Pierre Trudeau died, Harper\u00a0wrote: &#8220;Yes, he continues to define the myths that guide the Canadian psyche, but myths they are.&#8221; Harper used his first speech in the Commons as Leader of the Opposition in 2002 to criticize Jean Chr\u00e9tien on his relations with George W. Bush, and he <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB104881540524220000\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> a year later to apologize for Chr\u00e9tien&#8217;s stance on the Iraq war.</p>\n<p>These are all defensible positions, but they&#8217;re also striking in their consistency. It has never been obvious to Stephen Harper that a Canadian prime minister could have a legitimate reason for disagreeing with a Republican U.S. president. Or, for that matter, with Stephen Harper. NAFTA could fall apart any moment. That Canadian actions might cause that sad event would come as a surprise to just about any observer with even a cursory knowledge of the unique personality inhabiting the White House.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/nafta/\">NAFTA</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/stephen-harpers-no-good-advice-on-nafta/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Stephen Harper\u2019s no-good advice on NAFTA</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/harper-to-trudeau-canada-is-napping-on-nafta/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Harper to Trudeau: Canada is \u2018napping on NAFTA\u2019</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/that-time-a-kooky-leader-bizarrely-killed-a-canada-u-s-trade-deal/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>That time a kooky leader bizarrely killed a Canada-U.S. free trade deal</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/liberal-mp-says-trump-must-let-nafta-negotiators-do-their-job/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Liberal MP says Trump must let NAFTA negotiators \u2018do their job\u2019</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/nations-ponder-how-to-deal-with-trumps-withdrawal-doctrine/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Nations ponder how to deal with Trump\u2019s \u2018withdrawal doctrine\u2019</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/what-mexico-really-wants-from-a-free-trade-deal-respect/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>What Mexico really wants from a free trade deal: respect</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/bombardiers-trade-dispute-with-boeing-explained-with-toy-planes/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Bombardier\u2019s trade dispute with Boeing, explained with toy planes</strong></a></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/how-trump-and-trudeau-heated-up-the-white-house/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\">How Trump and Trudeau heated up the White House</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/stephen-harpers-nafta-memo-shows-how-little-the-former-pm-has-changed/\">Stephen Harper&#8217;s NAFTA memo shows how little the former PM has changed</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/stephen-harpers-nafta-memo-shows-how-little-the-former-pm-has-changed/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>24</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Welcome to your post-process years, Justin Trudeau</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/welcome-to-your-post-process-years-justin-trudeau/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/welcome-to-your-post-process-years-justin-trudeau/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2017 21:32:07 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Bill Morneau]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[economic update]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Justin Trudeau]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[liberals]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Melanie Joly]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1071825</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Paul Wells: The Liberals' big initiatives have proved exhausting.

(Chris Wattie/Reuters)</p></div>\n<p>Colleague John Geddes <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/bill-morneaus-shift-from-long-term-strategy-to-immediate-benefits/\" target=\"_blank\">had an insight</a> about yesterday&#8217;s economic statement from Finance Minister Bill Morneau that deserves more attention and some amplification:</p>\n<p><em>Last fall\u2019s version of the annual update </em>[Geddes writes]<em> was all about long-term plans for ensuring Canada\u2019s prosperity decades from now in a fiercely competitive world; this year\u2019s is all about converting today\u2019s unexpectedly strong growth into quick dividends for Canadian families.</em></p>\n<p>There are obvious reasons why this year&#8217;s update would feature more short-term thinking. The big one is that Morneau&#8217;s hair is on fire and he seems unsure what to do about it. But I strongly suspect we&#8217;re also seeing the results of some belated and generalized lesson-learning among the Trudeau Liberals.</p>\n<p>Morneau&#8217;s fall update and its two signature initiatives\u2014indexing the Canada Child Benefit and boosting the Working Income Tax Benefit\u2014are the work of a <em>chastened</em> government that has worked hard for two years to reinvent many wheels, and is (and here, I&#8217;m guessing) not sure all of it was worth the effort.</p>\n<p>Indexing the CCB and boosting the WITB are tweaks to existing, established programs. They&#8217;ll deliver smoothly and in ways the recipients will notice and, the Liberals hope, appreciate. Morneau wasn&#8217;t above a little sleight of hand on timing\u2014the CCB increase doesn&#8217;t take effect until next year, the WITB changes a year after that\u2014but on the whole, these new measures will deliver billions of dollars to target sectors with minimum fuss, controversy or administrative overhead.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>RELATED:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeaus-money-pit-and-those-working-hard-to-join-it/\" target=\"_blank\">Justin Trudeau\u2019s money pit, and those working hard to join it</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Contrast that with&#8230; most of everything else this government has done. The big announcements in Morneau&#8217;s fall update from a year ago\u2014the Canada Infrastructure Bank and the Invest in Canada Hub\u2014still aren&#8217;t up and running. Both are <a href=\"https://www.appointments-nominations.gc.ca/slctnPrcs.asp?menu=1&amp;lang=eng&amp;SelectionProcessId=9CD61AC8-521D-4AA9-85E9-F51B509AE6F4\" target=\"_blank\">still hiring directors</a>\u00a0for their oversight bodies. Meanwhile, the country forgot to thank the Liberals for either of these novel ideas. I think the Infrastructure Bank is a really exhilarating long shot, but <a href=\"https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/case-for-canada-infrastructure-bank-not-compelling-researchers-warn/article34898110/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&amp;\" target=\"_blank\">researchers</a> and the <a href=\"https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/senate-criticizes-federal-infrastructure-program-as-too-complex/article34159536/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&amp;\" target=\"_blank\">Senate</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/11/14/guy-caron-liberal-infrastructure-bank-plan_n_12964990.html\" target=\"_blank\">opposition</a> have done nothing but kvetch, while the project&#8217;s fans have been more reticent.</p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s not as though only Morneau&#8217;s 2016 fall update was cursed with growing pains. Just about every attempt at structural reform has run into organizational hassles, administrative bloat, delay and headaches. From the electoral-reform consultations to the parliamentary-reform consultations to Morneau&#8217;s own business-taxation consultations, the Liberals&#8217; big attempts to reach out to Canadians for advice and ideas have been mixed at best, and <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/throw-another-minister-on-the-bonfire-the-ballad-of-bill-morneau/\" target=\"_blank\">catastrophic</a> at worst.</p>\n<p>Often there isn&#8217;t even any discernible fault: this government inherited the Phoenix pay system mess from its predecessor, for instance, and it still can&#8217;t make it work. And then there is the <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/lost-and-broken/\" target=\"_blank\">inquiry</a> into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. And the marijuana legalization. And Kirsty Duncan&#8217;s fundamental science review. And Navdeep Bains&#8217;s supercluster initiative. And the climate-change plan, which seems to have gone away, though it can&#8217;t stay gone for long, can it?</p>\n<p>One of the best illustrations of how disillusioning these grand reforms can be came just today, in the form of a Radio-Canada story on Heritage Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly&#8217;s already much-derided digital culture initiative. Rad-Can had the bright idea to <a href=\"http://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1063197/experts-decus-de-lentente-avec-netflix-est-ce-quon-etait-juste-des-potiches\" target=\"_blank\">go back and interview</a> the members of an experts&#8217; panel that advised Joly on her reforms. Do they think it&#8217;s gone well? To be helpful, Rad-Can let them speak off the record. Turns out they think she&#8217;s made a hash of everything! &#8220;I wonder whether I&#8217;ve wasted a part of my life,&#8221; one says. I have a sneaking suspicion the minister\u00a0lately wonders the same thing.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not as though all of these initiatives were bad ideas. I suspect Trudeau would repudiate very few of them. Some may yet pay off big, both in generalized national wellbeing and in political advantage for the Liberals. But taken together they must be simply <em>exhausting</em>. A government that has run only marathons eventually discovers it is not as fond of complexity as it once was. It starts looking for quick simple payoffs.</p>\n<p>I suspect this fondness for administrative simplicity, while late-blooming, will prove durable. Advocates for change in just about any field would do well to consider whether there are existing, proven mechanisms for getting results that they could push, as opposed to sweeping two-year reform projects or policy startups of shaky legitimacy and untested workability. In one of the fields I obsess over for no easy-to-explain reason, science policy, the longstanding and lately poorly funded <a href=\"http://www.science.gc.ca/eic/site/063.nsf/eng/h_FEE7261A.html?OpenDocument\" target=\"_blank\">federal granting councils</a> suddenly look pretty good: they&#8217;re accepted by researchers, they get money into the intended hands, and what&#8217;s suddenly highly valuable, they&#8217;re unlikely to be the source of unpleasant surprises if they&#8217;re used to deliver more money.</p>\n<p>Sturdy policy pipelines like that will be valuable in any number of policy areas, as a government that&#8217;s had to battle through nasty controversy begins to realize it is closer to its next rendezvous with voters than to its last.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/justin-trudeau/\">JUSTIN TRUDEAU</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/canadas-very-expensive-finance-minister/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Morneau, Canada\u2019s very expensive finance minister</a></strong></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-at-the-halfway-point-or-the-precipice/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Justin Trudeau at the halfway point, or the precipice</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/gord-downie-remembered-tributes-to-the-tragically-hip-frontman/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Gord Downie remembered: Tributes to the Tragically Hip frontman</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/trudeaus-pandering-small-business-tax-cut-will-do-nothing-for-the-economy/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Trudeau\u2019s pandering small business tax cut will do nothing for the economy</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-prime-minister-s-tax-reform-damage-control-tour/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Prime Minister\u2019s tax reform damage control tour</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/welcome-to-your-post-process-years-justin-trudeau/\">Welcome to your post-process years, Justin Trudeau</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/welcome-to-your-post-process-years-justin-trudeau/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>15</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Why Quebec&#8217;s Bill 62 is an indefensible mess</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-quebecs-bill-62-is-an-indefensible-mess/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-quebecs-bill-62-is-an-indefensible-mess/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2017 20:11:18 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Bill 62]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[face covering]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Muslim]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Quebec]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[religion]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[St\u00e9phanie Vall\u00e9e]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1070885</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Paul Wells on the key reasons that the province's anti-face-covering law is ludicrous claptrap that makes no sense</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-quebecs-bill-62-is-an-indefensible-mess/\">Why Quebec&#8217;s Bill 62 is an indefensible mess</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_1071093\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1071093\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/OCT23_WELLS_POST.jpg\" alt=\"Warda Naili poses for a photograph on a city bus in Montreal, Saturday, October 21, 2017.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Graham Hughes</p></div>\n<p>Before we begin: Look, I&#8217;m one of the <em>good</em> anglos, the ones who&#8217;ve lived in Quebec (largely in French) (and enjoyed it), understand at least some of\u00a0its distinct ways and can recite at least some of the catechism by heart. In <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/jagmeet-singhs-quebec-problem/\" target=\"_blank\">this July colum</a><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/jagmeet-singhs-quebec-problem/\" target=\"_blank\">n</a> I walked readers through the Quiet Revolution and its revolt against the dominance of the Roman Catholic church, to help explain why attitudes toward so-called ostentatious religious signs are often different there. &#8220;The Quiet Revolution in Quebec was specifically a rebellion against religious influence,&#8221; I wrote then. &#8220;Progressive politics in many other parts of the country has been a politics of generalized tolerance; in Quebec progressive politics was often a politics of specific resistance.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That column won respectful comments from many in Quebec and a\u00a0long Reddit\u00a0thread of the imagine-finding-something-so-reasonable-in-<em>Maclean&#8217;s</em>-of-all-places variety, along with heaps of scorn from some anglophone colleagues. Chris Selley at the <em>National Post</em> is <a href=\"http://nationalpost.com/opinion/chris-selley-cowardly-quebec-liberals-pretend-disgraceful-niqab-ban-isnt-really-a-niqab-ban\" target=\"_blank\">still subtweeting</a>.</p>\n<p>Anyway, having thus re-established my credentials, I&#8217;m here to tell you that Bill 62, the so-called &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/travaux-parlementaires/projets-loi/projet-loi-62-41-1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Act to foster adherence to State religious neutrality</a>,&#8221; is a ludicrous claptrap that the government of Philippe Couillard should withdraw before it collapses in court under the weight of its own absurdity. Here&#8217;s why.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>RELATED:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/quebecs-bill-62-is-what-islamophobia-looks-like/\" target=\"_blank\">Quebec\u2019s Bill 62 is what Islamophobia looks like</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>The bill ostracizes behaviour that isn&#8217;t religious</strong>. Obviously inspired, or provoked, by the face coverings worn by a tiny number of women in Quebec who profess the Muslim faith, the bill hasn&#8217;t the guts to say, &#8220;Muslim women shouldn&#8217;t cover their face.&#8221; So it says instead that nobody may cover their face. &#8220;Personnel members of bodies must exercise their functions with their face uncovered, unless they have to cover their face, in particular because of their working conditions or because of occupational or task-related requirements,&#8221; the bill says. &#8220;Similarly, persons receiving services from such personnel members must have their face uncovered.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This means, as we&#8217;ve seen, that if you cover your face for any reason except workplace safety, you can&#8217;t do work for the Quebec government\u2014or receive its services\u2014for the duration of the covering. The justice minister, St\u00e9phanie Vall\u00e9e, has said that this extends to sunglasses. Surely scarves, ski hats and beards are a no-no too. All of which is odd, because this is supposed to be about religious neutrality\u2014it says so right there in the bill&#8217;s title\u2014and yet no provision restricts any specifically religious behaviour or garb.</p>\n<p><strong>It permits all sorts of religious behaviour</strong>. Since the bill\u00a0limits\u00a0only face covering, it establishes no prohibition against public servants wearing crucifixes, turbans, kippehs or indeed any Muslim-associated garment short of a veil. So in seeking to establish &#8220;religious neutrality,&#8221; it forbids things that aren&#8217;t religious and\u00a0has no effect on a wide range of things that are. <em>Faut le faire</em>, as we say.</p>\n<p><strong>It tells a lie about Quebec</strong>. The bill&#8217;s tiny number of supporters\u2014almost all of whom say it is insufficient in itself but that it serves as a kind of handy limbering-up exercise for the <em>really</em> repressive anti-headgear measures that must\u00a0follow\u2014purport that it\u00a0is valuable because it reminds\u00a0everyone that\u00a0state actors must refrain from identifying their religion, because &#8220;the State has no religion.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But the State isn&#8217;t Leviathan, the aggregate total of all human activity on its behalf. In a modern democracy, the State is plural. The state isn&#8217;t colourless: it has the skin of whichever bus driver or file clerk you&#8217;re talking to at the moment. It isn&#8217;t dimensionless: it is as tall or short as the judge or cop you&#8217;re facing. It isn&#8217;t even devoid of political opinion, for its members are free to vote. And it isn&#8217;t faithless in retail, only wholesale. While the Quebec government has no established religion\u2014never mind the crucifix over the Speaker&#8217;s chair in the National Assembly, it&#8217;s just there for dramatic irony\u2014its employees are, <em>of course</em>, free to turn toward whatever deity they dread or cherish, or to ignore them all.</p>\n<p>What they aren&#8217;t supposed to do, of course, is impose their religion on others. But that leads me to the bill&#8217;s worst outrage:</p>\n<p><strong>It reintroduces the coercive State</strong>. If the best (and still none too good) argument for Bill 62 is that &#8220;the State has no religion,&#8221; then it is absurdly out of bounds for the bill to dictate how the <em>citizen</em> must behave in her interactions with the government, on vaguely, passively-aggressively half-assed religious grounds. Even if every public servant in Quebec were made to read the collected works of Richard Dawkins, spayed\u00a0or neutered, chopped or stretched to measure, issued the regulation skin tone, accent, wardrobe and whatever else were necessary to telegraph the State&#8217;s neutrality on a hundred relevant axes of faith, appearance, socio-economic status and whatnot else\u2014even if you stipulate that the State may do that to its own emissaries, then it&#8217;s still really weird for the State to require an equivalent neutrality <em>of the citizen</em>.</p>\n<p>Here we see Bill 62 dipping into the territory Richard Hofstadter described in his classic\u00a0<a href=\"https://harpers.org/archive/1964/11/the-paranoid-style-in-american-politics/\" target=\"_blank\">essay</a> <em>The Paranoid Style in American Politics</em>: the odd propensity of groups to imitate, unconsciously, the behaviour they most despise in the opposing groups they fear or target. Hofstadter was describing anti-Communist groups in the Cold War United States, imposing the same secrecy, rigid organization and even penchant for falsification that they feared in Stalinism. But Hofstadter specified that the instinct was owned by neither the left nor the right, and that it wasn&#8217;t restricted only to Cold War contexts. The paranoid style is easy to spot in all kinds of contexts where people worry too much.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>WATCH:\u00a0Trudeau says what women wear is not \u2018government\u2019s business\u2019</strong></p></blockquote>\n\t\t<div class=\"bc-video bc-video-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"player-loader\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n\t\t\t<iframe src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/video/iframe/13639244001/VJjIBwmqg/5622800073001\"\n\t\t\t\twidth=\"640\"\n\t\t\t\theight=\"360\"\n\t\t\t\tallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tmozallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; right: 0px; left: 0px;\" class=\"rdm-brightcove-videojs-iframe\"></iframe>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n<p>What&#8217;s wrong with Islam, after all? The\u00a0Couillard government&#8217;s response comes in layers: (i) nothing, which is why the bill doesn&#8217;t name Islam; (ii) terrorism, though of course, most Muslims shun and hate terrorism, and at any rate, wearing a niqab on the bus has nothing to do with terrorism, so never mind; (iii) coercion\u2014in this case, the belief that some women wear certain clothes because they know men who require it. Well, ain&#8217;t it the damnedest thing, then, that Bill 62 seeks to fight coercion with coercion. A singularly time-limited, bashful, unevenly applied, hypocritical coercion, but coercion all the same. Orwell said some things are so stupid only an intellectual could believe them. Similarly, some things are so reminiscent of the overweening Catholic Quebec state of the mid-20th century that only in the name of purging\u00a0such authority could anyone dream them up.</p>\n<p>The fear at the root of bills like 62 and the substantially more odious Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Charter of Quebec Values is that noxious ideas will spread: that the most\u00a0backward and extreme\u00a0interpretations of Islam will win converts simply by being permitted to exist. But that&#8217;s silly. There&#8217;s no perceptible rate of conversion to Judaism in Outremont simply because a lot of Hasidim live there. Muslims don&#8217;t make me Muslim by standing near me.</p>\n<p>If the State has no religion, then the simplest way to express this principle\u2014after unscrewing the crucifix from the National Assembly&#8217;s rear wall\u2014is to forbid the active <em>promotion</em> of religion while on the taxpayer dime. Proselytizing, in other words. If the guy at the SAQ folds religious tracts in with your wine receipt, it&#8217;s okay for the government to say that&#8217;s a no-no. If your Jewish or Muslim doctor tries to trade a hernia operation for a conversion, that could be seen as going a step too far, and appropriately sanctioned. That all of this sounds ridiculous, because of course there is no doctor or liquor sales clerk who acts like that, is simply further evidence that there is no real problem here to solve.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/too-many-canadians-dont-recognize-the-islamophobia-in-their-country/\" target=\"_blank\">Too many Canadians don\u2019t recognize the Islamophobia in their country</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The Quebec Liberal Party could have been the one to say so. But a characteristic of the Quebec Liberal Party, going back decades, is that it keeps forgetting that a &#8220;Quebec consensus&#8221; exists only to the extent that every player in the society&#8217;s elite chooses to play. On religious accommodations as on various elements of the national unity debate, if courageous leaders would simply say, &#8220;I disagree,&#8221; there would therefore be no consensus.</p>\n<p>The Couillard government having failed to do so, it has fallen to just about every serious commentator in Quebec to point out Bill 62&#8217;s obvious incoherence.\u00a0 Many are doing it in a curious two-step: the bill is terrible, but isn&#8217;t it awful that those obtuse anglophones outside Quebec, with their worship of multiculturalism, don&#8217;t understand it. We are reminded that France has laws similar to Bill 62. As if comparison were justification. As\u00a0if any element of France&#8217;s relations between Muslims and the non-Muslim majority were worth copying. The enclaves where communities rarely mingle? The very low rate of integration?</p>\n<p>Bill 62 deserves criticism because it is a terrible bill. Its title doesn&#8217;t match its contents, it permits and forbids things with no logic, it would lead to a government whose actions would be less just and less coherent than they already are. I don&#8217;t associate sloppy work with\u00a0any\u00a0ideal of Quebec, and I&#8217;m surprised that some of\u00a0the province&#8217;s politicians and\u00a0commentators think anyone should.</p>\n<p><strong>WATCH MORE: Bill 62 is what Islamophobia looks like</strong></p>\n\t\t<div class=\"bc-video bc-video-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"player-loader\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n\t\t\t<iframe src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/video/iframe/13639244001/VJjIBwmqg/5626153757001\"\n\t\t\t\twidth=\"640\"\n\t\t\t\theight=\"360\"\n\t\t\t\tallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tmozallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; right: 0px; left: 0px;\" class=\"rdm-brightcove-videojs-iframe\"></iframe>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n<p><strong>MORE BY\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/paul-wells/\">PAUL WELLS</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-at-the-halfway-point-or-the-precipice/\" target=\"_blank\">Justin Trudeau at the halfway point, or the precipice</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeaus-money-pit-and-those-working-hard-to-join-it/\" target=\"_blank\">Justin Trudeau\u2019s money pit, and those working hard to join it</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/can-ottawa-stop-canadas-deadly-opioid-crisis/\" target=\"_blank\">Can Ottawa stop Canada&#8217;s deadly opioid crisis?</a></strong></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/throw-another-minister-on-the-bonfire-the-ballad-of-bill-morneau/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Throw another minister on the bonfire: The ballad of Bill Morneau</strong></a></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/can-justin-trudeau-get-big-things-built/\" target=\"_blank\">Can Justin Trudeau get big things built?</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-quebecs-bill-62-is-an-indefensible-mess/\">Why Quebec&#8217;s Bill 62 is an indefensible mess</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-quebecs-bill-62-is-an-indefensible-mess/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>33</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Justin Trudeau at the halfway point, or the precipice</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-at-the-halfway-point-or-the-precipice/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-at-the-halfway-point-or-the-precipice/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2017 10:39:52 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Bill Morneau]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Justin Trudeau]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1069729</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Paul Wells: The next two years will be a race between the better angels of the Trudeau legacy and the worse</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-at-the-halfway-point-or-the-precipice/\">Justin Trudeau at the halfway point, or the precipice</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_1070231\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1070231\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/OCT19_WELLS_POST.jpg\" alt=\"Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Goalkeepers event in Manhattan, New York, U.S., September 20, 2017.

There&#8217;s a serious bottleneck for important decisions, with the choke point in the Prime Minister&#8217;s Office. Rookie ministers, which is most of them, are held close. Those who don&#8217;t perform are sent new staffers from the PMO: career growth comes from the centre, not the bottom.</p>\n<p>A cabinet full of\u00a0political neophytes\u2014and there is nothing Trudeau could have done to avoid that, given how few seats he had before 2015\u2014has been\u00a0trained to cling for dear life to talking points. The result is unsettling: most of the cabinet simply ignores any specific question and charges ahead with the day&#8217;s message, conveying the unmistakable impression they are not as bright as\u2014given their achievements before politics\u2014they must surely be. Or that they think their audience isn&#8217;t. I doubt this is what anyone intends, but by now it&#8217;s deeply baked into the learned reflexes of this government.</p>\n<p>Then there is this tax mess. I&#8217;m agnostic on the policy question: in my own life I&#8217;ve been spectacularly unimaginative in organizing my finances for minimal taxation. I put all the book money into RRSPs, called my condo an office for the two years I used it as one, and that was the end of that. But the summer tax adventure has left the Liberals with their hair on fire, for two broad reasons. One is that Bill Morneau&#8217;s personal <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/heres-why-bill-moreau-didnt-sell-his-stock-or-set-up-a-blind-trust/\" target=\"_blank\">financial arrangement</a>s are becoming surreal. The other is the way the project\u2014and especially the life stories of its stewards, Trudeau and Morneau\u2014undermined the Liberals&#8217; claim to be champions of the middle class.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-problem-with-trudeaus-high-road/\" target=\"_blank\">The problem with Trudeau\u2019s high road</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The claim was always shaky. Trudeau opened his speech to the 2014 Liberal convention in Montreal by describing a young mother named Nathalie, whose distinguishing characteristics were that she made $40,000 a year, that she worried a lot, and that she didn&#8217;t exist.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>WATCH: The opposition turns up the heat on Monreau</strong></p></blockquote>\n\t\t<div class=\"bc-video bc-video-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"player-loader\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n\t\t\t<iframe src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/video/iframe/13639244001/VJjIBwmqg/5615243156001\"\n\t\t\t\twidth=\"640\"\n\t\t\t\theight=\"360\"\n\t\t\t\tallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tmozallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; right: 0px; left: 0px;\" class=\"rdm-brightcove-videojs-iframe\"></iframe>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n<p>Nathalie was a composite character\u00a0invented to illustrate Trudeau&#8217;s\u00a0claims about the middle class, including stagnant wage growth. The Laval University economist Stephen Gordon showed that Nathalie&#8217;s family income, if she were a person, has probably <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/a-short-history-of-nathalies-familys-income/\" target=\"_blank\">grown by nearly 30 per cent since 1997</a>. The real reason we never heard from Nathalie after the convention, however, is probably that the Liberals&#8217;\u00a0so-called middle-class tax cut wouldn&#8217;t much help her: &#8220;In both absolute terms and as a percentage of income, someone earning $150,000 gets more than someone making $50,000,&#8221; Gordon wrote.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/a-short-history-of-nathalies-familys-income/\" target=\"_blank\">A short history of Nathalie&#8217;s family income</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Still, the Liberals charged ahead with approximate remedies to oddly-defined problems. In March Jean-Yves Duclos, a shy and\u00a0likeable former head of the Laval University economics department, held a news conference to demonstrate the government&#8217;s work for the middle class. He offered no definition of &#8220;middle class&#8221; and no detailed description of what the government has done, or of what effect it&#8217;s had. \u201cThere are Canadians that feel that they belong to the middle class for perhaps reasons beyond their level of consumption and income,\u201d\u00a0Duclos actually said.</p>\n<p>Soon after, Morneau endorsed this political economics of mood:\u00a0\u201cWhen we look at what\u2019s gone on around the world, is there anybody who questions that we should be focused on how people feel? What are the outcomes if we don\u2019t? So I think we\u2019re going to stay on that message.\u201d</p>\n<p>This is how a party that called for evidence-based policy swiftly graduated to defending feelings-based policy. This is how you get a government that sets out to correct a boom in incorporations spurred by the gap between personal and small-business tax rates, then ends up increasing that gap and abandoning most of the tools it chose to combat the trend. It&#8217;s how you get a minister who spends July, August and September attacking loopholes and October watching his colleagues defend his use of loopholes. It&#8217;s what happens, or probably should, when the very rich launch a campaign against the tax advantages of the\u00a0somewhat rich for the purpose of impressing a police-sketch hunch about the middle class.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/why-everyone-feels-like-theyre-in-the-middle-class/\" target=\"_blank\">Why everyone feels like they\u2019re in the middle class</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>I have no idea how this ends. Historically, first-term majority governments usually get elected to a second term, whether majority or minority. Historically, if you&#8217;ve been waiting impatiently for a government you hate to get its comeuppance, you&#8217;re probably a poor judge of whether that&#8217;s about to happen. Trudeau&#8217;s governing mandate is designed to be backloaded with exciting announcements: by 2019 Canada&#8217;s skyline should be so studded with construction cranes it&#8217;ll look like a live-action version of <em>Blade Runner</em>. So don&#8217;t count the Trudeau Liberals\u00a0out.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s hard to be entirely saddened by Trudeau&#8217;s current discomfort, which if nothing else might shake his team out of the towering sanctimony that characterizes too much of its action and rhetoric.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/justin-trudeau/\">JUSTIN TRUDEAU</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/gord-downie-remembered-tributes-to-the-tragically-hip-frontman/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Gord Downie remembered: Tributes to the Tragically Hip frontman</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/trudeaus-pandering-small-business-tax-cut-will-do-nothing-for-the-economy/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Trudeau\u2019s pandering small business tax cut will do nothing for the economy</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-prime-minister-s-tax-reform-damage-control-tour/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Prime Minister\u2019s tax reform damage control tour</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/liberals-to-announce-small-business-tax-cut/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Liberals to announce small business tax cut</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/what-mexico-really-wants-from-a-free-trade-deal-respect/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>What Mexico really wants from a free trade deal: respect</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeaus-money-pit-and-those-working-hard-to-join-it/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Justin Trudeau\u2019s money pit, and those working hard to join it</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/how-trump-and-trudeau-heated-up-the-white-house/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>How Trump and Trudeau heated up the White House</strong></a></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/inside-the-progressive-think-tank-that-really-runs-canada/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\">Inside the progressive think tank that really runs Canada</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-at-the-halfway-point-or-the-precipice/\">Justin Trudeau at the halfway point, or the precipice</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-at-the-halfway-point-or-the-precipice/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>6</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Justin Trudeau&#8217;s money pit, and those working hard to join it</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeaus-money-pit-and-those-working-hard-to-join-it/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeaus-money-pit-and-those-working-hard-to-join-it/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2017 21:15:29 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Bill Morneau]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Justin Trudeau]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[middle class]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[plutocrats]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[tax reform]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1068553</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Paul Wells: Can the Aga Khan-vacationing, French villa-owning Liberals still be the great defenders of Canada's middle class?

(Yuri Gripas/Reuters)</p></div>\n<p>Come on, be fair now: Who among us hasn&#8217;t forgotten a villa in France, and the tax-dodging shell company we set up in our own name to manage it? Bill Morneau&#8217;s a square gee, a straight shooter, and if two years of talking about the middle class! and those working! hard! to join it! didn&#8217;t jog\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/morneau-company-france-ethics-1.4351933\" target=\"_blank\">hazy sun-drenched memories\u00a0of <em>le beau paysage proven\u00e7al</em></a>, well, let he who is without\u00a0early administrative confusion cast the first stone.</p>\n<p>Now the Trudeau government is in a bit of a pickle, because on Monday Morneau, who apparently still expects to be the finance minister by then, will meet a <a href=\"http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/finance-minister-bill-morneau-briefing-liberal-caucus-at-special-meeting-monday-1.3630945\" target=\"_blank\">hastily-convened caucus of Liberal MPs</a> to announce the terms of\u00a0 his retreat from the battle for tax fairness. This is problematic, because while the Liberal caucus is definitely the one likeliest to contain MPs with perfectly legal tax-sheltered villas in Provence, not <em>all</em> of them are blessed in precisely that way. And some of the\u00a0more\u00a0plain-folks Liberals\u00a0may wonder what, at this stage, still makes Morneau the ideal standard-bearer for the tax fairness crusade, such as it is. Can they rally behind his common-guy aura? His debating skill? His straight talk? His attention to detail? Uh-oh.</p>\n<p>Suddenly everything that hurts the Liberals most is happening on terrain that Justin Trudeau sought, announced and has defended since long before he became prime minister: the mythical fight for the middle class against callous governments and greedy plutocrats.</p>\n<p>Go back to Trudeau&#8217;s canonical February 2014 speech to the Liberal convention in Montreal. &#8220;To wealthier Canadians, I say this: the growth we have seen over the past three decades has been the product of a broadly supported agenda,&#8221; he said then. &#8220;The original promise of that agenda was that everyone would share in the prosperity that it creates. That hasn\u2019t happened&#8230; If we don\u2019t fix it, the middle class will stop supporting a growth agenda.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Trudeau views Donald Trump as the physical expression of withdrawn middle-class support for a growth agenda. The reason Bill Morneau repeats his incantations to the middle class! and those working! hard! to join it! every time he rises in the House of Commons is because Trudeau has long believed a government is either on the right side of that fundamental issue or it will not long remain in government. And the Liberals did big things early to ensure they will head into another election with interesting things to say about defending the middle class: on child benefits, on broad-based tax relief, on pensions.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>RELATED:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/throw-another-minister-on-the-bonfire-the-ballad-of-bill-morneau/\" target=\"_blank\">Throw another minister on the bonfire: the ballad of Bill Morneau</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>But a government that spends <a href=\"https://www.blacklocks.ca/budget-cover-cost-212234/\" target=\"_blank\">$212,000 designing the cover of a budget document</a> isn&#8217;t on the side of the little guy. A government that needs several days to decide it won&#8217;t <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-government-cra-employee-discount-1.4349651\" target=\"_blank\">tax employee benefits</a> isn&#8217;t helping itself. A government led by a guy who vacations with the Aga Khan and then needs to be cornered into admitting it is sending serious mixed messages about who&#8217;s first in its hearts. And a government that&#8217;s after your doctor&#8217;s tax savings but is OK with Bill Morneau&#8217;s just might be clumsy enough to make you feel more sympathetic toward doctors.</p>\n<p>At the heart of the government&#8217;s current confusion is Justin Trudeau&#8217;s\u00a0peculiar relationship with large concentrations of money. You can define just about every Canadian prime minister in part through their relationship to money. Stephen Harper distrusted capital, was as immune to its attractions as anyone can be, and it helped him ride a populist instinct for years after his opponents should have realized he was far removed from the stereotypical Bay Street fat-cat Tory. Paul Martin was thigh-deep in Catholic guilt over his own wealth. Jean Chr\u00e9tien was efficiently Janus-faced, smalltown\u00a0populist on one hand, wired into the Desmarais billions on the other.</p>\n<p>Trudeau&#8217;s harder to define, but there is something in him that views the very rich as inherently virtuous, or at least as so full of possibility that they must be treated as synonymous with virtue. Hence Davos. Hence the <a href=\"https://ca.news.yahoo.com/canadian-pm-justin-trudeau-rocks-215414086.html\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft CEO Summit</a>\u00a0and the <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/07/27/justin-trudeaus-summer-homework-easing-canadas-brain-drain-paul-wells.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dock (Un)Conference</a>, a Muskoka retreat where Trudeau met executives from GE and Facebook and Air Canada. Hence the <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/11/15/trudeau-and-cabinet-woo-international-money-paul-wells.html\" target=\"_blank\">2016 meeting at Toronto&#8217;s opulent Shangri-La Hotel</a> where he presented a slide deck\u2014developed in collaboration with New York&#8217;s BlackRock investment firm\u2014to representatives of the world&#8217;s most deeply-pocketed sovereign wealth funds, a few hundred billion in every chair in the room. And the <a href=\"https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/trudeau-attended-cash-for-access-fundraiser-with-chinese-billionaires/article32971362/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&amp;\" target=\"_blank\">cash-for-access fundraiser with the Chinese billionaires</a>.</p>\n<p>Everyone had a good chuckle when the Prime Minister justified the meeting with the rich Chinese guys as a part of his agenda to advance the interests of the mythical working class, but in his mind that&#8217;s precisely what he was doing. He wants to attract investment to Canada. He wants to do it in numbers that trail majestic trains of zeros. He can&#8217;t get that by schlepping down to Tim Horton&#8217;s and shaking the hands of regular folk. He might by schlepping down to Seattle to shake the hands of jillionaires. The prime minister&#8217;s full time critics view his dalliances with money as\u00a0proof that he is merely starstruck; he is as certain that there is strategy in every mountain resort conference.</p>\n<p>But if you keep making a face your mouth freezes that way, and the more time Trudeau spends chasing billions, the less attention his government\u00a0devotes to mere millions\u2014or to mere villas in France. There are dangers here: &#8220;white elephants and corruption,&#8221; I <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/08/19/philpotts-limo-bill-offers-warning-to-liberals-in-future-paul-wells.html\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> 14 months ago. A few weeks\u00a0later I <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/09/23/liberals-should-be-wary-of-overspending-and-corruption-paul-wells.html\" target=\"_blank\">added</a> a third: &#8220;That this government will no longer seem populated by the sort of people most Canadians ever get to meet or know.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The latest danger is a kind of socio-economic targeting error. The incorporated-business tax mess is a lot of things, but to the extent it was designed to reinforce the sense of fairness among the many who are tired of the depredations of the few, it was peculiar in its selection of the &#8220;few.&#8221; It&#8217;s true that if you&#8217;re incorporating and sprinkling and using all the other tricks Morneau targeted to keep your tax bill low, you&#8217;re almost certainly making more money than the average Canadian. <em>But you&#8217;re probably not stinking rich, either</em>. You&#8217;re probably making more than $200,000 and less than a few million. Which is an odd choice of target, because there really are fat cats out there, and by and large the Trudeau government is exquisitely solicitous of their care, feeding and comfort.</p>\n<p>Chrystia Freeland famously wrote a book called <em>Plutocrats</em>. She was introduced into the Liberal party, when she first appeared as a candidate for the 2015 election, as the kind of person who spoke the language of fairness between the very rich and the rest of us. Her book opens with a fabulous vignette, the &#8220;coming-out party&#8221; for America&#8217;s plutocracy, the day of the $31 billion IPO for the Blackstone private equity\u00a0firm. One of the company&#8217;s leaders, Pete Peterson, earned $1.88 billion on the day, which is handy because he needed to pay the bills for a party for his daughter Holly at New York&#8217;s Four Seasons Hotel. Holly paraphrased the dinner conversation: &#8220;If you&#8217;re going to have four houses, and you&#8217;re going to run four houses, it&#8217;s like you start spending some money.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is the government that got elected on a promise to go hunting after plutocrats. Somehow it keeps missing them. That&#8217;s becoming a serious political problem for that government. One wonders how long it will be before Justin Trudeau notices, but who&#8217;s going to tell him?

(Photograph by James Park)</p></div>\n<p>Shortly before 7 p.m. on a quiet night in late September, Marilou Gagnon was in an Ottawa park, teaching two volunteers how to watch a drug addict for signs of an overdose.</p>\n<p>The briefing took about 20 minutes and involved showing the volunteers through basic first-aid kits and simple procedures. Gagnon\u2019s instructions culminated in one message: if it seemed that an overdose was under way, experienced volunteers on hand would call 911, and the city\u2019s emergency services would take it from there.</p>\n<p>This is the bare-bones mission of Overdose Prevention Ottawa (OPO), which was open for the 25th consecutive night when I visited it in mid-September. Shortly after 7 p.m., people began arriving at the park\u2014really only a scruffy patch of grass next to a parking lot in Ottawa\u2019s hardscrabble Lowertown neighbourhood\u2014and making their way into one of two tents that had been pitched on the grass for the evening. In one tent, the \u201cguests,\u201d as OPO unfailingly calls them, would inject drugs they had brought to use. In the other, guests would smoke their product.</p>\n<p>None of this activity is sanctioned by law. Public authorities issued no approval for OPO before it opened. Ottawa\u2019s fabulously controversy-averse mayor, Jim Watson, has made his personal disapproval abundantly clear ever since.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/health/these-are-the-provinces-where-the-opioid-crisis-is-growing-fastest/\">These are the provinces where the opioid crisis is growing fastest</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Gagnon, an associate professor at the University of Ottawa School of Nursing, and a loosely knit group of community activists simply started operations one night in midsummer because they figured enough people had died from drug overdoses. It has subsisted on donated supplies, volunteer time and crowdfunded cash ever since. Gagnon and her associates have not been clear about when they will shut OPO down. But in the meantime, more than 1,000 guests have consumed their drugs in its tents. Every one has survived to see another day.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re the 26th site,\u201d Gagnon says later in a restaurant around the corner, where the staff is always happy to let OPO volunteers relax and nurse a soft drink. By \u201csite,\u201d she meant OPO is the 26th informal pop-up overdose-prevention site to open in Canada in a year.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s in addition to the much more elaborate supervised consumption sites, which have received formal legal sanction, provincial funding and an exemption from the federal Controlled Drugs and Substances Act so drug users can inject or smoke on the premises without worrying about legal sanction.</p>\n<p>Fifteen of these more elaborate sites have been approved across Canada since the 2015 election. There were only two before that, in Vancouver, including the Insite facility that started it all. Stephen Harper\u2019s Conservative government was so opposed to the notion of supervised consumption that it <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/uncategorized/swing-and-a-miss/\">fought</a> all the way to the Supreme Court for the right to shut Insite down. It <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/bold-and-cautious-dissecting-the-supreme-courts-insite-ruling/\">lost</a>, but Harper then passed a law that erected a series of procedural obstacles to opening more sites.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>RELATED:\u00a0</strong></p>\n\t\t<div class=\"bc-video bc-video-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"player-loader\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n\t\t\t<iframe src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/video/iframe/13639244001/VJjIBwmqg/5605727559001\"\n\t\t\t\twidth=\"640\"\n\t\t\t\theight=\"360\"\n\t\t\t\tallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tmozallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; right: 0px; left: 0px;\" class=\"rdm-brightcove-videojs-iframe\"></iframe>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</blockquote>\n<p>Last year Jane Philpott, the physician and hospital administrator who was then serving as Justin Trudeau\u2019s health minister, brought in a new law to radically simplify the approval process for supervised-injection sites. That\u2019s how Canada went from two supervised sites to what will soon be 17, with more likely to follow. The reason for Philpott\u2019s urgency was simple: Canadians are dying of opioid and other drug-related overdoses by the thousands, in a public-health crisis without many precedents.</p>\n<p>The best information Health Canada can gather puts the number of opioid-related deaths in Canada in 2016 at 2,816. By comparison, during the 2003 outbreak of Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), 44 people died in Canada. SARS was treated as a massive public-health emergency, with daily official briefings and, when the epidemic ended, a Rolling Stones concert outside Toronto.</p>\n<p>In British Columbia, by far the province hardest hit by opioid deaths, overdoses are killing twice as many people as traffic accidents. Yet too many Canadians still view opioids as somebody else\u2019s problem. And for many front-line workers like Gagnon, every level of government is still too sluggish to respond to the crisis.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1065947\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1065947\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MAC10_OPIOIDS_POST03.jpg\" alt=\"OPO (Overdose Prevention Ottawa) volunteers gather in a circle before opening up the pop-up supervised drug-use tent at Raphael Brunet park in Ottawa on Sunday, Oct. 1, 2017.

(Photograph by James Park)</p></div>\n<p>Hence the pop-up site in Ottawa\u2019s Lowertown, and dozens more like it across Canada. Supervised consumption sites like Insite and a new clinic that opened two blocks away from OPO shortly after I visited are evidence of the Trudeau government\u2019s willingness to act more boldly than its predecessor. But the pop-up sites exist in the gap between the federally sanctioned sites and the far greater demand. Gagnon is the first to admit the fully sanctioned sites are more elaborate. \u201cThey actually do wound care on-site. They do counselling. They do treatment for hepatitis C. Referrals. Testing for hep C, pregnancy, HIV, whatever. If someone coming in has just been sexually assaulted, they do counselling for that. They can link people to detox services,\u201d she says. \u201cWhereas for us, it\u2019s basically just overdose prevention and first aid. If someone drops to the ground, you save them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now that the more elaborate legally sanctioned site was opening a stone\u2019s throw from OPO, why keep the pop-up site going? Because there\u2019s still a demand, Gagnon says. \u201cI have this feeling of being at the right place at the right time doing the exact right thing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just very special to witness the kind of resilience and support that people have. And the message that they get [from OPO volunteers] when they visit us is, \u2018You know what? We show up every night on our own time and on our own money because your life matters.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p>At the federal level, the story of the Liberals\u2019 response to opioids isn\u2019t one of inaction or apathy. Soon after Trudeau made Philpott his first health minister, she took a personal interest in opioid overdoses and deployed a coordinated set of responses quickly. \u201cWe are in a crisis,\u201d she said in 2016. \u201cBut in this crisis, we will not merely be spectators.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/canadas-new-health-minister-faces-the-opioid-crisis/\">Canada\u2019s new health minister faces the opioid crisis</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Philpott moved quickly to increase access to naloxone, a self-administered remedy for opioid overdoses, which is now available without prescription and often free of charge at hundreds of pharmacies. The government supported a private members\u2019 bill by B.C. Liberal MP Ron McKinnon that protects people against drug possession charges if they called 911 because somebody they knew was overdosing. The bill is now law.</p>\n<p>At a two-day opioid summit in Ottawa in November 2016, the feds, provinces and an array of groups\u2014medical, dental and nursing schools, chiropractors and more\u2014agreed to coordinate their efforts. Six months later, a senior health department official, Suzy McDonald, took over full-time responsibility for coordinating the federal response to the crisis. The minister \u201cwas very interested and very engaged,\u201d McDonald told <em>Maclean\u2019s</em>. \u201cShe really wanted us to turn the tide on this crisis.\u201d</p>\n<p>In an ungainly federation like Canada, where provincial health departments are jealous of their jurisdictional prerogatives, simply working together can pose a challenge. How do you count an overdose death? Some provinces were reluctant to conclude an overdose until many months after a death. That made tracking a crisis cumbersome.</p>\n<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada sent epidemiologists into every province and territory to investigate how to get timely data. Coroners from across the country met in Ottawa to debate a common definition for overdose deaths. But now that better information is coming in, the picture is not encouraging, McDonald says. \u201cWe know that this crisis is ongoing, we know it\u2019s increasing, we also see signs that it\u2019s spreading across the country. Based on the projections we have from the first quarter of 2017, if nothing happens, [this year] will be worse [than 2016].\u201d</p>\n<p>A big part of the problem is fentanyl, entering from China and hitting communities in Western Canada first. That\u2019s one reason B.C. and Alberta account for nearly half of all overdose deaths in 2016, and the provinces east of Ontario for less than 10 per cent among them. \u201cIf we have a contaminated drug supply that spreads across this country, deaths will increase,\u201d McDonald says.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/how-fentanyl-turned-an-er-doctor-into-an-addict/\">How fentanyl turned an ER doctor into an addict</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>So the federal government is seized with the urgency of the crisis. It\u2019s changed laws and knocked heads to accelerate the speed and scope of the response. One of the best ministers in Trudeau\u2019s government took a personal interest in the scale of human suffering. And yet these tricky and complex synthetic compounds, often hiding undetected in impure street drugs, will almost surely kill more Canadians this year than last year.</p>\n<p>I asked OPO\u2019s Gagnon whether she\u2019s met Philpott. \u201cDepends what you mean by \u2018meet,\u2019 \u201d she says. With other activists, she stood and turned her back on Philpott when the minister spoke at an opioid conference in Montreal last year.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s missing? In a nutshell, greater willingness by governments to climb a steep slope that starts with reducing the stigma on drug addiction, and progresses to decriminalization, either in controlled circumstances or more broadly. Not because drugs aren\u2019t associated with grave problems, but because the problems in question are mostly socio-economic, and anti-drug laws aren\u2019t helping solve them.</p>\n<p>The federal Liberals, following Philpott\u2019s lead, have actually put considerable effort into reducing the stigma around drug addiction and use. At a Canadian Medical Association conference in Quebec City this summer, Philpott urged delegates to spread the word that \u201cpeople who use drugs are people who do not need judgment. They need what all Canadians expect from health systems\u2014that is, compassionate care.\u201d In early October, MPs were invited to a social mixer in Parliament\u2019s Centre Block where members of the Canadian Pharmacists Association taught them how to administer naloxone, a potent overdose blocker. The event would have been unimaginable in the days of the Harper government.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1057069\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1057069\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MAC08_05_OPIOIDS_POST03.jpg\" alt=\"A popup safe injection tent in Vancouver\" width=\"822\" height=\"462\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MAC08_05_OPIOIDS_POST03.jpg 822w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MAC08_05_OPIOIDS_POST03-300x168.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MAC08_05_OPIOIDS_POST03-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MAC08_05_OPIOIDS_POST03-600x336.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Popup safe injection tent in a Downtown Eastside alley in Vancouver, British Columbia, November 18, 2016. (Rafal Gerszak)</p></div>\n<p>But people who work with drug users say there\u2019s a big layer of stigma that won\u2019t go away as long as drug use is criminalized. Stigma, and added danger. \u201cHaving an unregulated market that is super-competitive, mixed with prohibition, creates the perfect formula for the most dangerous drugs to be introduced,\u201d Gagnon argues. \u201cIt\u2019s a very competitive market. So if you provide a stronger drug, people will notice that. They\u2019ll want to purchase your product.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ottawa\u2019s mayor, Jim Watson, can\u2019t quite find his way to destigmatize chronic drug use. He has refused to visit OPO, and when the new supervised consumption site opened two blocks away, began calling for the pop-up site to shut down. \u201cThe reality is that we have a legitimate, federally approved, provincially funded, city-operated facility that is safe, that is secure, that is clean, that is run by health professionals, and it\u2019s in an appropriate location,\u201d Watson told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s time for that volunteer group to go and work with public health and give the park back to the children and families in the Lowertown neighbourhood.\u201d</p>\n<p>This is two kinds of farce. first, the cramped and grimy park where OPO operates was never a big hit with \u201cchildren and families\u201d at any point in its history. Second, Watson fought for years against the sort of safe, secure site he now embraces as a solution to opioid overdoses.</p>\n<p>A surprising champion has been leading the charge in Ottawa for some measure of decriminalization of hard drug use. Vern White used to be Ottawa\u2019s chief of police, and he was appointed to the Senate by Stephen Harper. He has emerged as a supporter not only of supervised consumption sites but of allowing them to provide clean drugs at the door to visitors, so they won\u2019t have to spend the rest of their day trying to score. Gagnon is an enthusiastic advocate of the notion.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/a-new-drug-more-toxic-that-fentanyl-hits-the-streets-in-alberta/\">A toxic drug, more powerful than fentanyl, hits Alberta</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>If job one at any overdose-prevention facility is to keep people alive, it\u2019s obvious that giving them a known dose of a known drug is better than letting them scrounge for doses of mysterious origin and composition, she says. \u201cAnd also you won\u2019t have to engage in sex work or do other things, maybe steal, to find money. And the rest of your day you can focus on maybe employment, or care. And that money you used to buy drugs, you can use it for better housing now, or better food.\u201d</p>\n<p>The next step beyond the supervised provision of hard-drug dosage to addicts at supervised sites would be broader decriminalization. Philpott travelled to Portugal last year, in part because the country has decriminalized simple possession and use of most classes of drugs. But she and her successor, the newly appointed health minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor, have flatly refused to consider following suit in Canada. Even advocates of a far more concerted national response to the opioid crisis are divided over decriminalization.</p>\n<p>Many are at least tempted. Chris Mackie is the medical officer of health for Middlesex-London in southern Ontario. A stubborn epidemic of injection drug use in London has led officials to launch the country\u2019s most ambitious needle-exchange program. Last year, more than three million needles were distributed in London, more than in Montreal or Toronto. Mackie\u2019s office works hard on street-level counselling and a range of other responses to the drug epidemic. And he emphasized that he is not advocating decriminalization: \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re quite ready at this point in our country.\u201d</p>\n<p>But the paradoxes of current policy haunt him. \u201cAs soon as someone\u2019s got a criminal record, it\u2019s really hard to get into the formal economy\u201d of good jobs and steady wages, he says. \u201cAnd they tend to get picked up very quickly in the informal economy\u201d\u2014petty theft and sex work. Improving their lives, and addressing the mix of trauma, mental illness and low wages that are intimately associated with hard drug use, becomes far harder then.</p>\n<p>What should be clear by now is that the scale of Canada\u2019s drug problem is far out of proportion to even a conscientious government\u2019s attempts to get on top of it. Maybe a few local politicians, like Ottawa\u2019s mayor, can get comfort by averting their gaze from the obvious gap between the scale of the human tragedy and the scale of the available government-sanctioned remedies. But a caring country needs to do better.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/can-ottawa-stop-canadas-deadly-opioid-crisis/\">Can Ottawa stop Canada&#8217;s deadly opioid crisis?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/can-ottawa-stop-canadas-deadly-opioid-crisis/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>6</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Throw another minister on the bonfire: the ballad of Bill Morneau</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/throw-another-minister-on-the-bonfire-the-ballad-of-bill-morneau/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/throw-another-minister-on-the-bonfire-the-ballad-of-bill-morneau/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2017 01:26:18 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Bardish Chagger]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Bill Morneau]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Justin Trudeau]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Maryam Monsef]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[tax reform]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1067149</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Paul Wells on the finance minister's tax reform flub, and why it's becoming an embarrassing pattern for the Trudeau government </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/throw-another-minister-on-the-bonfire-the-ballad-of-bill-morneau/\">Throw another minister on the bonfire: the ballad of Bill Morneau</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_1066355\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/BILL_MORNEAU_JUSTIN_TRUDEAU.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1066355\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1066355\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/BILL_MORNEAU_JUSTIN_TRUDEAU.jpg\" alt=\"Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau, left, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Jake Wright/CP)\" width=\"822\" height=\"462\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/BILL_MORNEAU_JUSTIN_TRUDEAU.jpg 822w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/BILL_MORNEAU_JUSTIN_TRUDEAU-300x168.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/BILL_MORNEAU_JUSTIN_TRUDEAU-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/BILL_MORNEAU_JUSTIN_TRUDEAU-600x336.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau, left, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Jake Wright/CP)</p></div>\n<p>In retrospect, it will be seen as fitting that Finance Minister Bill Morneau started working on the second draft of his planned overhaul\u00a0of corporate taxation during the 2017 Thanksgiving weekend.</p>\n<p>First, because Thanksgiving is often\u00a0used\u00a0for\u00a0cutting up turkeys. And it&#8217;s becoming clear that Morneau&#8217;s\u00a0project, a bigger political gobbler than the Liberals ever imagined, is in for a close encounter with a\u00a0carving\u00a0board.</p>\n<p>Already last week, and again\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thehouse/the-complex-politics-of-taxes-and-pipelines-1.4340097/morneau-working-on-fixing-controversial-tax-changes-1.4343337\" target=\"_blank\">in an interview broadcast over the weekend</a>, the finance minister was spelling out five &#8220;principles&#8221; for fixing his reform\u2014principles that\u00a0convey marked overtones of contrition:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\u2022 Support small businesses.<br />\n\u2022 Keep small business taxes low while supporting owners who invest and create jobs.<br />\n\u2022 Avoid creating unnecessary red tape for small businesses.<br />\n\u2022 Recognize the importance of family farms, and ensure tax changes do not affect the transfer of family businesses to the next generation.<br />\n\u2022 Ensure any changes to the tax system promote gender equity.</p>\n<p>Note that Morneau&#8217;s &#8220;principles&#8221; consist of three declarations of obeisance to small business; half of a fourth to family farms; the other half to family businesses; and that on the fifth principle, the Liberals find themselves playing defence on gender equity, an issue they must have thought they owned outright until they were accused by interest groups of <a href=\"https://fmwc.ca/women-and-supporters-march-on-parliament-hill-against-liberal-tax-plan/\" target=\"_blank\">lowering the glass ceiling</a> over the heads of women entrepreneurs.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>WATCH MORE: Morneau continues to defend controversial tax proposals</strong></p></blockquote>\n\t\t<div class=\"bc-video bc-video-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"player-loader\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n\t\t\t<iframe src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/video/iframe/13639244001/VJjIBwmqg/5589029358001\"\n\t\t\t\twidth=\"640\"\n\t\t\t\theight=\"360\"\n\t\t\t\tallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tmozallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; right: 0px; left: 0px;\" class=\"rdm-brightcove-videojs-iframe\"></iframe>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n<p>We&#8217;ll know for sure when Morneau announces the second draft of his tax reform, but I have a hard time reading this list as anything more than the beginning of a concerted effort to calm some deeply ticked-off segments of Canadian society. If you feel a need to offer belts, suspenders <em>and</em> velcro strips to &#8220;small business,&#8221; it&#8217;s because you have noticed that the gods of small business are not happy.

On Monday the <a href=\"http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2017/10/nobel-prize-awarded-richard-thaler.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nobel Prize for economics went to Richard Thaler</a>, whose advances in &#8220;behavioural economics&#8221; help explain why individuals don&#8217;t always behave as rational actors. Thaler won for a\u00a0wide range of work, but some of it has to do with the &#8220;<a href=\"http://webspace.pugetsound.edu/facultypages/gmilam/courses/econ291/readings/KKT%20Endow%20JEP.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">endowment effect</a>,&#8221; by which people put a much higher value on something they have in hand than they would have been willing to pay to acquire it.</p>\n<p>The experiments Thaler and his colleagues, including fellow Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, describe in the paper I just linked are so fun they&#8217;re worth your time. In one, half the students in an experimental group were given crappy logo mugs from the university bookstore, and then a bidding market was opened among students. The students with the mugs priced them way above their market value; the ones without mugs offered less than the market price. Very few mugs changed hands, because almost the only people who wanted a mug were the ones who&#8217;d just been handed a mug at random.</p>\n<p>This all suggests, the authors wrote in that 1991 paper, that &#8220;individuals have a strong tendency to remain at the status quo, because the disadvantages of leaving it loom larger than advantages.&#8221; That should have rung some bells in the Finance department this summer. A major\u00a0premise\u00a0of Morneau&#8217;s reform is that the rate of incorporation for tax purposes has more than doubled in recent years.\u00a0The assumption\u00a0that went along with that premise was\u00a0that these recent gains could be easily rolled back. But that&#8217;s asking a lot of human nature: <em>You&#8217;ve only recently figured out how to save thousands of dollars on your taxes, so we&#8217;re hoping you won&#8217;t mind being made to unlearn how to do it.</em></p>\n<p>Morneau and Justin Trudeau are learning the power of the endowment effect. It&#8217;s got to sting, because as Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre reminds them every chance he gets,\u00a0those two should know something about endowments.</p>\n<p>Supporters of the Morneau reform proposal have a few more days to defend them on their merits before the minister cuts his losses. Morneau will then join two other inexperienced Trudeau ministers who piloted major reforms right into the nearest hillside. This is becoming a pattern. The first was Maryam Monsef\u2014remember her? I&#8217;m told she&#8217;s still\u00a0in the cabinet\u2014who <a href=\"https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/trudeau-abandons-electoral-reform/article33855925/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&amp;\" target=\"_blank\">spent a year and a half trying to find a method of electoral reform</a> that both the Liberals&#8217; opponents and their leader could stomach. She had round tables, a coast-to-coast consultation tour, a special parliamentary committee, a mail-out pamphlet thing, and a dozen other techniques for finding the pulse of the people on electoral reform. Only it turned out the people didn&#8217;t have a pulse, and to the extent it could be resuscitated, most people wanted proportional representation, which Trudeau didn&#8217;t. So that was the end of that.</p>\n<p>Up next was Bardish Chagger, who produced a discussion paper on <a href=\"http://thechronicleherald.ca/nsvotes/1464405-liberals-back-down-on-parliamentary-changes-but-closure-will-be-cost-chagger\" target=\"_blank\">parliamentary reform</a>, didn&#8217;t like most of what she heard in the discussion, and withdrew nearly the whole project two months later.</p>\n<p>The\u00a0similarities among these three reform attempts are striking. First, the government launches a major reform with a set of proposals that would, if implemented, certainly create winners and losers.\u00a0This galvanizes the potential losers; potential winners are less excited, because the uncertainty in the Liberals&#8217; project\u2014<em>it&#8217;s only a discussion paper! Nothing&#8217;s written in stone!</em>\u2014is more demobilizing to people facing hypothetical gains than to people facing hypothetical losses.</p>\n<p>There follows an extended period during which the Liberals are\u00a0astonished to find themselves swarmed by\u00a0detractors. The detractors are organized, numerous, networked, agile and full of surprises. The Liberals are none of these things.</p>\n<p>In fact,\u00a0the Liberals are less agile today than they were in November of 2015. First, because the few Liberals with real-world experience and a contrarian bent (John McCallum, St\u00e9phane Dion) have been whisked off to their reward outside Ottawa. Those who remain are rookie MPs thrust into fancy-sounding jobs before they&#8217;ve even learned how to project their voices in the House of Commons. They&#8217;re surrounded by legions of rookie staffers who are assigned to populate the rookie ministers&#8217; social-media accounts with gigabytes of flattering photos and nonstop\u00a0cheerleading about what a progressive, green, innovative bunch of things they&#8217;re doing for the middle class! and those working! hard! to join it.</p>\n<p>Second, because these under-experienced, over-flattered rookies have been thrust into combat without even being permitted to do combat. These are <em>consultations</em>, after all, so heaven forbid the ministers defend their projects in detail while their opponents are swarming them. Monsef, Chagger and Morneau were instead restricted to bland scripted generalizations that left each, in turn, sounding either deaf or arrogant. Sorry, ministers, but the proper answer to &#8220;Why are you doing <em>this specific thing</em>?&#8221; isn&#8217;t &#8220;Our government believes in delivering results for the middle class! and those working! hard! to join it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s striking how\u00a0consistently the Liberals absent themselves from national conversations they started. Most of Morneau&#8217;s tour on the tax changes was held at venues from which reporters were barred; when they were allowed in, they saw a minister who simply refused to address many of the specific questions that were put to him. This was familiar to anyone who saw Chagger pursue her doomed reform, which was familiar to anyone who saw Monsef pursue her doomed reform. It&#8217;s almost like there&#8217;s a design flaw.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t how conversations go. In a conversation, you say something, and then I respond with something that acknowledges what you just said, tries to incorporate part of it, takes issue with another part. In a Trudeau Liberal conversation, a minister spends months saying the same thing, and then a large machine behind the curtain spits up a new project that has very little to do with the project the minister just spent months defending. The good news is that the economy&#8217;s going well, because in most other ways this is a strange way to run a parliamentary democracy.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/justin-trudeau/\">JUSTIN TRUDEAU</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/jagmeet-singh-on-his-path-to-the-prime-ministers-office/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Jagmeet Singh on his path to the prime minister\u2019s office</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/can-justin-trudeau-get-big-things-built/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Can Justin Trudeau get big things built?</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/the-trudeau-governments-policies-reward-dependence-not-hard-work/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Trudeau government\u2019s policies reward dependence, not hard work</strong></a></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/on-foreign-policy-trump-and-trudeau-are-feckless-birds-of-a-feather/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\">On foreign policy, Trump and Trudeau are birds of a feather</a></strong></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/jagmeet-singh-and-the-newest-new-ndp/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Jagmeet Singh and the newest new NDP</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/teens-to-trudeau-no-pot-isnt-easier-to-get-than-alcohol/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Teens to Trudeau: No, pot isn\u2019t easier to get than alcohol</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/throw-another-minister-on-the-bonfire-the-ballad-of-bill-morneau/\">Throw another minister on the bonfire: the ballad of Bill Morneau</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/throw-another-minister-on-the-bonfire-the-ballad-of-bill-morneau/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>32</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Can Justin Trudeau get big things built?</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/can-justin-trudeau-get-big-things-built/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/can-justin-trudeau-get-big-things-built/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2017 21:52:59 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Bill Morneau]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[canada infrastructure bank]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Justin Trudeau]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1066427</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>For Canada to attract billions of dollars in foreign investment, the deepest pockets in the world must regard this country as an oasis of long-term stability.

Not only were\u00a0there\u00a0<a href=\"https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/basic-economics-killed-the-energy-east-pipeline/article36500053/\" target=\"_blank\">quick analyses</a> written to that effect on Thursday, there were <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/new-brunswick/trump-energy-east-keystone-xl-1.3953898\" target=\"_blank\">predictions to that effect written before the National Energy Board changed its evaluation criteria</a>.</p>\n<p>But the main protagonist, TransCanada itself, is not mute. The proponent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markusoff/status/916017195439734784/photo/1\" target=\"_blank\">wrote to the NEB to throw in the towel</a>. Its letter names one specific obstacle to continuing: &#8220;substantial uncertainty around the scope, timing and cost associated with the <em>regulatory</em> review of the projects [emphasis mine].&#8221; The &#8220;existing and likely future delays resulting from the regulatory process, the associated cost implications&#8221; \u2014 and unspecified other &#8220;issues and obstacles&#8221; facing the projects \u2014 were all TransCanada needed to call it a day.</p>\n<p>That helps explain why Alberta premier Rachel Notley, who was elected on much the same sales pitch Trudeau used on energy files\u2014energy and the environment need not be antagonistic, a cleaner government will have an easier time finding markets, and so on\u2014had a blunt message for the NEB in her own <a href=\"http://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/energy-east-pipeline-cancellation-leaves-rachel-notley-deeply-disappointed\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a>: &#8220;Investors need confidence&#8221; and &#8220;We look forward to seeing that certainty in place soon.&#8221;<span id=\"more-1066427\"></span></p>\n<p>Living out here as we do in the world of the non-elected, you and I are not required to pick\u00a0a single culprit for every decision. It&#8217;s possible that low resource prices and Donald Trump&#8217;s firm &#8220;probably&#8221; on Keystone had a lot to do with this decision, <em>and</em> that the NEB had a lot to do with it as well.</p>\n<p>The current state of affairs\u2014that large and controversial projects designed to achieve legal ends for legitimate businesses <em>somehow never seem to end up getting built\u2014</em>has implications beyond the realm of oil and climate change.</p>\n<p>The Trudeau government&#8217;s economic plans depend to a great extent on the hope that foreign investors with deep pockets will find Canada a congenial place to park their billions. This is most spectacularly true of the <a href=\"http://www.infrastructure.gc.ca/CIB-BIC/index-eng.html\" target=\"_blank\">Canada Infrastructure Bank</a>, so cherished by Bill Morneau that I&#8217;m told it was never the object of a <a href=\"http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/index.asp?lang=eng&amp;page=information&amp;sub=publications&amp;doc=mc/mc-eng.htm\" target=\"_blank\">memorandum to cabinet</a> for general discussion (and potential dissent)\u00a0among a large number of ministers. Morneau simply announced the Bank in a fall update in 2016 and bankrolled it in his 2017 budget, and from there, it&#8217;s up to the world&#8217;s pension funds to come shopping for ports, roads and railways to invest in. But the government also wants to make CETA real by attracting big European investments, and it is always hoping for some kind of breakthrough in trade with Asia, especially China.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/canadas-regulatory-process-will-deter-chinese-infrastructure-investment-says-envoy/\" target=\"_blank\">Canada\u2019s regulatory process will deter Chinese infrastructure investment, says envoy</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>For the kind of step change in foreign investment that the Trudeau government wants\u2014investments on the scale of many tens of billions of dollars in the aggregate\u2014to happen, the deepest pockets in the world need to be able to regard Canada as an oasis of long-term stability.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not good enough to say that Canada looks like a safer bet than the United States for the next couple of years, or that Canada tops Britain in some ways for the duration of the old sod&#8217;s lamentable Brexit adventure. Canada needs to be better than investing <em>anywhere</em>. Indeed, it needs to be better than <em>not</em> investing.</p>\n<p>The Infrastructure Bank already comes loaded with some obstacles to the easiest and fastest investment decisions. For instance, it&#8217;s said to be aimed at promoting only &#8220;greenfield&#8221; projects, newly-built developments with their attendant risk of delays and cost overruns, instead of the already-existing &#8220;brownfield&#8221; projects investors prefer. And we don&#8217;t even know what will happen if all the projects that attract investment to the Bank are in one or two provinces, leaving the impression that you can&#8217;t count on global investors to play the regional-equity games so dear to our fragile federation.</p>\n<p>The bigger concern for today is that you only write a cheque with eight\u00a0or 10 zeros on it if you think you&#8217;re putting your money somewhere pretty safe. A Canada locked in crisis talks with the Trump administration over its key continental trade deal doesn&#8217;t look like that place. A Canada <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/09/21/big-money-leaving-canada-over-tax-changes-john-manley-says_a_23218305/\" target=\"_blank\">whose big-business CEO association accuses the government of driving business from the country</a> doesn&#8217;t look like that place. And a Canada where social license never seems to get granted, and any project that crosses three provincial boundaries becomes a bottomless pit of recrimination and finger-pointing, doesn&#8217;t look like that place. That&#8217;s not a day&#8217;s headache. It&#8217;s a really big problem.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/can-justin-trudeau-get-big-things-built/\">Can Justin Trudeau get big things built?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/can-justin-trudeau-get-big-things-built/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>23</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Jagmeet Singh and the newest new NDP</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/jagmeet-singh-and-the-newest-new-ndp/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/jagmeet-singh-and-the-newest-new-ndp/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 01 Oct 2017 21:51:58 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Jagmeet Singh]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Justin Trudeau]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[NDP]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[NDP leadership]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[New Democratic Party]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1064575</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Paul Wells: The NDP was born from the hope that things can change and in Jagmeet Singh it has picked the young, optimistic outsider </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/jagmeet-singh-and-the-newest-new-ndp/\">Jagmeet Singh and the newest new NDP</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_1064609\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/OCT1_JAGMEET_SINGH2_POST.jpeg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1064609\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1064609\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/OCT1_JAGMEET_SINGH2_POST.jpeg\" alt=\"Jagmeet Singh, centre right, sits with his mother Harmeet Kaur, centre left, father Jagtaran Singh, left, and campaign manager Michal Hay, right, as it's announced he has won the first ballot in the NDP leadership race to be elected the leader of the federal New Democrats in Toronto on Sunday, October 1, 2017.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young</p></div>\n<p>Suspense is overrated anyway. Jagmeet Singh&#8217;s first-ballot thumping of his opponents in the NDP leadership contest makes\u00a0big history: in the 150th anniversary year of Confederation, a major political party\u00a0has finally broken the country&#8217;s uninterrupted string of white faces at the head of national parties. The scale of Singh&#8217;s victory makes him, at least for several months to come, the uncontested and comfortable leader of his party, in contrast to the 12 consecutive ballots in the Conservative race that had Andrew Scheer in second place before Scheer finally eked out a win. And Singh&#8217;s victory completes the inversion of the youth-vs.-experience argument that dominated the 2015 election campaign.</p>\n<p>A bit about that last part first. In December 2013 I ran into Justin Trudeau at an Ottawa movie theatre. He was taking the kids to see <em>Frozen</em>, but he paused to talk shop at the concession stand. He was pleased with the news that Stephen Harper had handpicked a former communications director, Dimitri Soudas, to be the Conservative Party&#8217;s executive director.\u00a0It was\u00a0a sign Harper would stick around until the 2015 election. Trudeau liked the contrast: &#8220;I need \u2018old,\u2019 &#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Well, now he has it: Born on Christmas Day 1971, in Singh and Scheer he&#8217;ll face two children of 1979 in the next election, along with whoever will then be leading the Green Party (one suspects it&#8217;ll be the same person who always does). Trudeau cannot run 2019 as a repeat of 2015. The erstwhile avatar of youth, change, optimism, style and an ecstatic embrace of diversity is now outbid on most of those attributes by Singh. As for the last element of his 2015 appeal, a tendency to smirk when his elders lectured him on arithmetic, that&#8217;s not wearing well either.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>RELATED:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/five-key-things-jagmeet-singh-said-on-winning-the-ndp-leadership/\" target=\"_blank\">Five key takeaways from Jagmeet Singh\u2019s NDP leadership speech</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s no mystery why some of the happiest spectators to the Singh upset were Conservatives.\u00a0Conservatives lose when the Liberals capture most of the left-of-centre vote. (They would lose if the NDP did the same, but with the partial exception of 2011, it&#8217;s never happened.) Justin Trudeau picked up more NDP support in 2015 than Conservative support, and <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-look-for-the-union-label/\" target=\"_blank\">everything he does</a> suggests he&#8217;s been planning to\u00a0crowd the NDP on his way to re-election.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>WATCH: Jagmeet Singh speaks about victory</strong></p></blockquote>\n\t\t<div class=\"bc-video bc-video-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"player-loader\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n\t\t\t<iframe src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/video/iframe/13639244001/VJjIBwmqg/5595053972001\"\n\t\t\t\twidth=\"640\"\n\t\t\t\theight=\"360\"\n\t\t\t\tallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tmozallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; right: 0px; left: 0px;\" class=\"rdm-brightcove-videojs-iframe\"></iframe>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n<p>That path is now\u2014well, not definitively blocked, but complicated. Liberals I talk to aren&#8217;t terrified of Singh, but they don&#8217;t write him off either. Every knock against Singh for youth or inexperience is one that would have applied to Justin Trudeau, not long ago. The two even share a strength: conspicuous organizational muscle. Even though he wasn&#8217;t a candidate, Singh was billed as the guarantor of federal NDP strength in the\u00a0Brampton region in the early days of the 2015 election. That didn&#8217;t pan out. Navdeep Bains and several of his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9s swept all those ridings. All hands are well aware their rematch will be one of the central dramas of the next election, and the way Singh just swept the leadership suggests he has been working on his chops.</p>\n<p>The NDP more broadly has had a weird couple of years. The party cashiered Tom Mulcair on the floor of its Edmonton convention last year, and voted to &#8220;study&#8221; the <a href=\"https://leapmanifesto.org/en/the-leap-manifesto/\" target=\"_blank\">Leap manifesto</a>,\u00a0a decision to which it devoted no perceptible follow-through. The party&#8217;s lone Quebec leadership candidate, Guy Caron, was endorsed by a former leader, Alexa McDonough, and by Jack Layton&#8217;s best strategist, Brian Topp; for all that, Caron came a distant fourth in a four-candidate field. One Quebec MP has already threatened to quit the caucus if Singh became leader, and there&#8217;s <a href=\"http://nationalpost.com/news/politics/division-over-religious-symbols-in-quebec-takes-centre-stage-ahead-of-ndp-leadership-showcase\" target=\"_blank\">conspicuous nervousness</a> over the prospects\u00a0of a Singh-led NDP in a province where it&#8217;s common to debate religious headgear. Singh is clearly eager for the test and confident of his chances. Probably it&#8217;ll be healthier for the NDP to confront these stereotypes than to try to\u00a0mollify them.</p>\n<p>One final quirk of this swiftly aging, ever-New Democratic Party. It is becoming remarkable how often the party reaches outside its parliamentary caucus for renewed leadership. Tommy Douglas was still in Saskatchewan provincial politics when the he became leader of the newly-christened NDP in 1962. Audrey McLaughlin had been an MP for barely two years when she became the party&#8217;s leader in 1989. Alexa McDonough was not an MP when she won. Nor was Jack Layton. Tom Mulcair had more parliamentary experience, on the day he became leader, than his three most recent predecessors combined. The experience, like that of Caron, Charlie Angus and Niki Ashton, seems to have disappointed New Democrats more than it impressed them.</p>\n<p>The NDP was born from the hope that things\u00a0can change, not at the edges but fundamentally and in a rush, and whenever it has been tested it has fallen back on that hope. The party\u00a0knew Jagmeet Singh less well than any of the candidates he beat, but it is used to leaps of faith. One day one will pay off.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/ndp/\">NDP</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/get-real-jagmeet-singh-has-been-dealing-with-racist-hecklers-for-months/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Get real.

He spoke about that aspect of his work with Paul Wells.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How long have you known you\u2019d be ending your show this season?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>: Well, there\u2019s a couple of different answers. If you talk to friends of mine, I\u2019ve been saying this since Year 3 or 4. But I would say this summer is when the final decision was absolutely made. It\u2019s a hard job to walk away from because it\u2019s a great job. I always did think that the decision would be made for me\u2014I\u2019d run out of steam or people would stop watching or we would find we were running out of stories. None of those things happened. And we\u2019ve lasted a lot longer than most TV shows, so the time has probably come to move on.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Is it ever a hard show to do? I don\u2019t do comedy for a living, but I can imagine that having someone point to you every week and say, \u2018Now you\u2019ve got to be funny\u2026\u2019</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>: I would never complain about how hard it is to do the show. I think there are certain people who would look at my travel schedule and be aghast. They\u2019d think, \u2018Oh, I could never do that.\u2019 But I\u2019m good at it. I\u2019m not good at a lot of things, but I\u2019m good at that. The people I travel with are good at it. There\u2019s been no changes in that personnel, it\u2019s always the same people. So I\u2019m not complaining about the show. And it\u2019s pretty intense, there\u2019s no doubt about it, but I do 20 of them, or 21 depending on the year. And I always figure, well, you can do anything 21 times.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: In this last season, is it a different show in its conception, in its style, from when it started?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>: The show has changed, for sure. But not a lot. One of the surprises was, we became a family show. And I just didn\u2019t expect that to happen. When it started it was an adult show. Probably in the first season at some point, I said, \u2018Welcome to Regina, the city that rhymes with fun.\u2019 And I got emails from people saying, \u2018Well, I had to explain that joke to my seven-year-old.\u2019 I was thinking, Why are you watching with your kids? And then quickly, we realized it was very much a family show. Teachers were playing it in schools. Families were saying, \u2018Oh my God, my teenagers will finally sit in a room with me.\u2019 And we knew from the demographics we were getting young people, old people, everyone. And I like that. That was a pleasant revelation about the show and who was watching it.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/culture/television/rick-mercers-6-tips-for-fellow-or-aspiring-ranters-2/\" target=\"_blank\">Rick Mercer\u2019s 6 tips for fellow (or aspiring) ranters</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Q: It must force a rethink. When you go in as a kind of subversive\u2014\u2018Me and a few of my friends, we\u2019ve got this show on the CBC. And we\u2019re going to go in and cause all kinds of hell\u2019\u2014and then all of a sudden you become Captain Canada.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>: I\u2019ve never had a problem with being on at 8 o\u2019clock. I think some people struggle with that. The biggest thing you can\u2019t do at 8 o\u2019clock is say \u2018f&#8211;k,\u2019 and it\u2019s never been a mission of mine to say \u2018f&#8211;k\u2019 at 8 o\u2019clock. Lots of people in television fought really important battles to be able to say certain words at certain times, but it\u2019s just never been a hill I wanted to die on, or was interested in, in general. I\u2019ve always loved being on at 8 o\u2019clock. You\u2019ll never get a bigger number than 8 o\u2019clock and this is show business.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I\u2019m talking to you from Ottawa. What is it like to bring the show into Ottawa, where all of these very serious people are doing very serious things, often with a certain lack of self-awareness?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>: For me, personally, the Ottawa experience has changed immeasurably over the course of my career. I can remember, like literally the first time I went to Ottawa and I got a parliamentary press pass, albeit a temporary one, of course. That was one of the greatest days of my life. It\u2019s one of the few things I keep with me at all times in my office. And now I go to Ottawa and sometimes a cabinet minister says, \u2018I used to watch you in college.\u2019</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t go to Ottawa as much as I used to. I don\u2019t have politicians on the show as much as I used to. Now, never say never; Catherine McKenna\u2019s going to be on the show in the next week or so. But I made a decision not to spend so much time around them, and to spend more time outside that bubble.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How come?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>: I didn\u2019t want the relationship to get too cozy, I guess. I\u2019ve always been very careful about that. I\u2019ve always made a point of not becoming friends with politicians. There\u2019ve been exceptions to that rule. I happened to become friends with Belinda Stronach, when she was a Tory. But since then, I\u2019ve just been very careful about that.</p>\n<p>But that goes back to my very early days of my career when I was doing stage. I was performing live in Newfoundland and in Ottawa, and I spent a lot of time talking about John Crosbie, being very critical. One day a fellow asked me out for a bite to eat and drinks in Ottawa and his name was Ross Reid. He bought me dinner and we had drinks and we had a great chat about politics. Within about a month, John Crosbie had resigned, Ross Reid went for the nomination, got the nomination, got elected, and was the senior Newfoundland member in that caucus. Suddenly, he was, in theory, the new John Crosbie. And he had just bought me dinner and I\u2019d had drinks with him. I kind of viewed him as a friend of mine. It was kind of a lesson learned. No more free spaghetti dinners.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: You need to keep a certain distance. I learned that lesson later than I should have.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>: Absolutely. I was just fortunate that that spaghetti dinner put things into perspective.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What are politicians like to work with?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>: I think politicians are no different than anyone else. You can stumble across a fantastic interview with someone who has great timing and just has a natural ability to come across like they\u2019re having fun in a very positive way. And that person can be a lobster fisherman or a cabinet minister. Quite often politicians are trying too hard and that\u2019s a big problem. It just doesn\u2019t make for good TV. So they\u2019re a bit tricky to shoot with. There have been politicians, of course, that have incredible timing. Preston Manning has great timing. He can deliver a joke. He doesn\u2019t have a reputation for that but he certainly could. Obviously Jean Chr\u00e9tien could deliver a joke. He could deliver 10 in a row. He\u2019s a total professional. This crowd\u2014I\u2019d be hard-pressed to say who, out of this crowd, this cast we have now, who\u2019s got natural comic timing. I can\u2019t think of one off the top of my head.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: This crowd is kind of earnest.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>: Yeah. Although I\u2019m sure they think they\u2019re hysterical. I\u2019m sure if you ask them\u2026.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Are there things you want to do this final season that you\u2019ve never been able to do before?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>: It\u2019s not like that. I never think of it like that, like I\u2019ve always wanted to do X, Y, or Z in terms of an adventure. It\u2019s not my bucket list that we\u2019re working through. I realize I\u2019m working through a lot of people\u2019s bucket lists, but it\u2019s not mine. The show\u2019s been on for enough time that I can literally do what I want to do. I think our premiere episode is a perfect example of that. We opened with these athletes from the Invictus Games. I\u2019ve had a lot of members of the Canadian Forces on the show over the years. I\u2019ve been at military bases, put lots of soldiers on TV. They\u2019re always good interviews because you can always find well-spoken, funny people. But I also know a lot of soldiers who are in the situation that you find these Invictus athletes\u2014they\u2019re wounded or recovering from some sort of injury\u2014and I know how important the Invictus movement is to those soldiers. And I wanted to put them on TV. And we opened with a woman with extreme post-traumatic stress disorder, a guy with a catastrophic brain injury, and another guy who\u2019s missing both his legs above the knee and has had more surgeries than there are weeks in the year. I would suggest most comedy shows would not open like that. It\u2019s a great privilege to be able to do that.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Perhaps in that context I want to ask you about this column John Doyle had in the <em>Globe</em> the other day, where he said, \u2018Rick Mercer\u2019s great, everybody loves Rick Mercer. Enough comedy that\u2019s too gentle and too deferential.\u2019 What do you say about that?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>: I would say there\u2019s nothing gentle and deferential about a guy who\u2019s had both legs blown off, or a catastrophic brain injury or post-traumatic stress disorder. But that said, I think John Doyle is wishing I was something that I\u2019m not. It\u2019s hard to answer that criticism. It\u2019s like somebody saying, \u2018I like Paul Wells but I wish he\u2019d rhyme more. I like people who rhyme.\u2019 All right then, fine. Go find someone who rhymes. I don\u2019t really know what his point is? But it was refreshing to see that his TV column was about television.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: The CBC had a story where it said you have no idea what you\u2019re going to do after next June. Is that still the case?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>: That\u2019s absolutely true. It\u2019s not one of those scenarios where I have an idea what I\u2019m doing and I just can\u2019t talk about it. It\u2019s not that at all. You know, I always wanted to be in television. That\u2019s why I went into theatre, to get into television. And when I was a kid, I thought it was the most exciting thing in the world. I don\u2019t think that any more, obviously. That would be weird. But when I was a kid, I just thought it was the best thing in the world. So I\u2019ve always had a plan and a goal. But I\u2019ve achieved that goal. I\u2019ve done it. And so, what\u2019s next? I honestly don\u2019t know. And it\u2019s brand-new territory for me, because I\u2019ve always known what I wanted to do, and it\u2019s what I\u2019m doing right now.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/rick-mercer/\">RICK MERCER</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/order-of-canada-leaves-rick-mercer-completely-speechless/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Order of Canada leaves Rick Mercer \u2018completely speechless\u2019</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/rick-mercer-on-politics/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Rick Mercer on what\u2019s to come in 2014: \u2018Stephen Harper will resign\u2019</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/culture/television/rick-mercers-6-tips-for-fellow-or-aspiring-ranters-2/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Rick Mercer\u2019s 6 tips for fellow (or aspiring) ranters</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/education/uniandcollege/waterloos-geese-police-day-of-pink-mcgillleaks/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Waterloo\u2019s Geese Police, Day of Pink &amp; McGillLeaks</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/culture/television/parody-of-a-minute-rick-mercers-bathroom-signs/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Parody of a Minute: Rick Mercer\u2019s \u2018Bathroom\u2019</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-mercer-test/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Mercer test</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/why-i-rant/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Rick Mercer: Why I rant.

There&#8217;s considerable excitement in the research community over this appointment, which fulfills a 2015 Liberal campaign commitment, ticks off a point in Duncan&#8217;s November 2015 <a href=\"http://pm.gc.ca/eng/minister-science-mandate-letter\" target=\"_blank\">mandate letter</a>, and closes a job opening the government\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.appointments-nominations.gc.ca/slctnPrcs.asp?lang=eng&amp;SelectionProcessId=A2E3CD92-9963-40FF-906A-D4550223C164\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> eight months ago.</p>\n<p>Without knowing the identity of the new science guru, it&#8217;s fair to assume the person named will be a scientist of formidable achievement, dedicated to public service. What&#8217;s surprising is how frequently I run into people with an interest in science policy\u2014researchers, public servants, university administrators\u2014who aren&#8217;t sure why the position needs to exist. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how the government, and the new appointee, respond.</p>\n<p>The point of the 2015 Liberal campaign promise was clearly to remind people\u00a0that Stephen Harper had fired the previous science advisor, Arthur Carty, in 2008. What&#8217;s less often mentioned is that before Paul Martin created the post in 2004, the previous six prime ministers had managed to get by without one\u2014and that when Carty&#8217;s post was abolished, informed advisors were as likely to note the &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080130/full/451505a.html\" target=\"_blank\">small budget and vague mandate</a>&#8221; that the Martin government gave his office\u00a0as to scold Harper for shutting it down.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/innovative-science-research-in-canada-is-dying-a-silent-death/\" target=\"_blank\">Innovative science research in Canada is dying a silent death</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s also fair to assume the Trudeau government will give Science Advisor 2.0 a bigger budget\u2014this government isn&#8217;t shy about spending\u2014but the mandate will be interesting to watch.\u00a0I really think the science advisor was imagined, in the first place, as nothing more than a totem of the government&#8217;s virtue. If the advisor&#8217;s actual working role was considered at all, it seems to have been as a real-life version of <em>Star Trek</em>&#8216;s blue-shirted Mr. Spock, filing into the situation room off the Enterprise bridge to argue for logic against the outbursts of McCoy and Scotty. Already a question arises: what chance does a mere science officer have if the weird triplets from Planet Pollster, Ekos, Nanos and Ipsos, have other ideas?</p>\n<p>Duncan&#8217;s mandate letter asks her to &#8220;create a Chief Science Officer mandated to ensure that government science is fully available to the public, that scientists are able to speak freely about their work, and that scientific analyses are considered when the government makes decisions.&#8221; Fun questions: What, is science not fully available to the public now? Are scientists not able to speak freely about their work? Does this government not already, today, consider scientific analyses when making decisions?</p>\n<p>Those are pretty snotty questions, but they&#8217;re not <em>only</em> snotty questions. I&#8217;m actually pretty sure the answer to the third question, about considering scientific analyses, is &#8220;Yes, fairly often.&#8221; A veteran public servant reminded me recently that science is already deeply baked into thousands of government processes. Fisheries quotas aren&#8217;t, as a rule, set by whim: they take into account breeding patterns, ocean currents, climate, population distribution, and on and on. So for someone with a cubbyhole next to the accounting department to chirp up, three days before the fish quota announcement, and ask, &#8220;Hey, did they consider ocean currents?&#8221; is not overly helpful. Or necessary. Or, if one day some\u00a0government actually does become\u00a0hellbent on ignoring ocean currents for whatever reason, likely to tip the balance: it&#8217;s not as though this government is super-impressed by anything the Parliamentary Budget Officer says, after all.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-pbo-will-suffer-under-the-trudeau-governments-new-rules/\" target=\"_blank\">The PBO will suffer under the Trudeau government\u2019s new rules</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>By the time Duncan <a href=\"https://www.appointments-nominations.gc.ca/slctnPrcs.asp?lang=eng&amp;SelectionProcessId=A2E3CD92-9963-40FF-906A-D4550223C164\" target=\"_blank\">posted the opening for a science advisor</a>, more than a year after being asked\u2014a poker player would say that&#8217;s a tell\u2014the description had been modified, though not drastically. The three mandate-letter pillars are still there\u2014science available to the public, scientists free to speak freely, analyses considered. We learn that the new officeholder will &#8220;report to the Prime Minister and the Minister of Science.&#8221; Somewhere there&#8217;s a Dilbert cartoon about multiple reporting relationships. The advisor will also &#8220;focus on&#8230; how evidence is incorporated into government-wide decision-making&#8221; and &#8220;as an advisor&#8230; aim to provide&#8230; advice.&#8221; Well, thank God.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not an unworkable model. Quebec has a <a href=\"http://www.scientifique-en-chef.gouv.qc.ca/en/le-scientifique-en-chef/\" target=\"_blank\">chief scientist</a>, R\u00e9mi Quirion, who has considerable clout built into his job: he co-leads each of the three provincial research granting councils and chairs the board of directors for each. That&#8217;s real influence, so much of it\u00a0that he doesn&#8217;t need direct access to the premier&#8217;s ear. In Ottawa, a delicate question arises: If the new science advisor has the ability to decree change and privileged access to the PM, then why is there a science minister? Two delicate questions, actually, because the other one is: If the advisor <em>can&#8217;t</em> make change or sway the PM, then why is there a science advisor?</p>\n<p>I follow a lot of scientists on Twitter and have had many conversations with researchers about the new advisor post, and there&#8217;s actually a lot of excitement about the new advisor post\u2014but it&#8217;s for a reason the Trudeau government may not welcome.</p>\n<p>In April, an expert report commissioned by Duncan called for substantial increases in federal funding for pure science research. Funding levels weren&#8217;t part of the mandate for the panel, under former University of Toronto president David Naylor, but he decided they were too important to ignore. Impressed by his cheek, almost the entire research community <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-canadian-scientists-arent-happy/\" target=\"_blank\">called on the federal government to embrace Naylor&#8217;s request</a>. (You can find about a million tweets about this under the hashtag #SupportTheReport.)\u00a0The Trudeau government&#8217;s silence on funding levels is seen, by many researchers, as evidence of Duncan&#8217;s weakness within the government. Many hope a new science advisor can succeed where she didn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>To be frank, I don&#8217;t think advocating for research funding levels should be any part of the new advisor&#8217;s job. But the very question returns us to the same see-saw dilemma: If an advisor can achieve policy ends the minister can&#8217;t, then why is there a minister?

(Sean Kilpatrick/CP)</p></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s fun these days watching Pierre Poilievre go after Bill Morneau on the government&#8217;s proposed tax changes. Poilievre is the Conservative finance critic, and Morneau is the finance minister, and typically their exchanges go this way.</p>\n<p>Poilievre opens by asking\u00a0why Morneau is hellbent on\u00a0unleashing a plague of locusts on Canadian pizza parlour owners. Morneau says he&#8217;s not in fact doing that, he&#8217;s just trying to make the system more fair. Poilievre says, well, if you&#8217;re so obsessed with fairness, why\u00a0aren&#8217;t you touching the cozy tax rules that make life so cushy for Morneau Shepell, your own company, or inherited trusts like Justin Trudeau&#8217;s? Suddenly Morneau isn&#8217;t sure what to say next.</p>\n<p>Last Thursday, Poilievre began\u00a0by citing a\u00a0Canadian Federation of Independent Business survey\u00a0in which lots of respondents said &#8220;this new Liberal tax increase will make it harder to create jobs and grow. That means thousands of young people and new Canadians will not get that first job, and many more might be laid off.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Scare tactics,&#8221; Morneau replied. &#8220;We know that the current system, a system that they were comfortable with, actually gives advantages to the richest over the middle class.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Poilievre says, what do you mean, richest? &#8220;Our millionaire Prime Minister confirmed these tax changes will not affect what he called his &#8216;family fortune.&#8217; The Minister of Finance made sure his billion-dollar family business, Morneau Shepell is sheltered from any of the changes.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/trudeaus-small-business-tax-fight-fits-with-his-old-inequality-messaging/\" target=\"_blank\">Trudeau\u2019s small-business tax fight fits with his old inequality messaging</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Morneau was incensed. &#8220;Mr. Speaker, the member opposite is deliberately misleading Canadians.&#8221; You&#8217;re not allowed to say that, so the Speaker made him retract. Which he did, and then the minister\u00a0was left with more or less the same answer he&#8217;s had all along. &#8220;We know that our system right now encourages the wealthiest Canadians to set up a private corporation so they can pay a lower tax rate than middle-class Canadians. We know that the party opposite is perfectly comfortable with wealthier Canadians paying a lower tax rate than middle-class Canadians. What we are working toward is to make sure we look at those advantages, and listen to Canadians to make sure we are taking measures that will ensure that our system is fair.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is not a satisfying answer. If the government&#8217;s goal is fairness, then why can&#8217;t Morneau discuss the tax treatment of companies as big as his own? So the emerging dynamic is: Conservative asks question, Morneau argues fairness, Conservative points out something else in the world that obviously isn&#8217;t fair, Morneau doesn&#8217;t have an answer.</p>\n<p>This is because the nation&#8217;s finances are full of things that aren&#8217;t fair. And while it&#8217;s clear the Liberals hope to use their tax changes as a sort of parable for the standing-up-for-ordinary-workers part of their broader discourse\u2014a centre-left populism that Trudeau believes other like-minded leaders, such as Hillary Clinton, forgot to defend, to\u00a0their peril\u2014the specific tax changes in question didn&#8217;t appear on the Liberals&#8217; radar because the current arrangements are unfair.</p>\n<p>No, they first drew the attention of Liberals because they&#8217;d drawn the attention of the Finance department, because the use of incorporation to avoid hefty tax bills was increasing rapidly. A few years ago, incorporation for tax purposes was still a rather exotic procedure for many Canadians who could benefit. But the faster word spread about the formidable tax advantages, the more people made use of incorporation to cut their tax bills.</p>\n<p>Apparently a lot of people who&#8217;ve incorporated are sensitive about\u00a0having this gap between personal and small-business tax rates called a &#8220;loophole,&#8221; but what the heck: It&#8217;s a loophole, in the sense that it was never designed as a goal of public policy.</p>\n<p>There was never a meeting, under Paul Martin or Stephen Harper or anywhere else, where enlightened policy-makers sat around saying, &#8220;We need a way to encourage feisty innovators to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. If we can just get the gap between personal and small-business tax rates wide enough&#8230;&#8221; No, it just happened by accident.</p>\n<p>The large and accelerating rates of incorporation happened because of the weird interaction of two different populist instincts: (1) Even tax-cutting governments were reluctant to reduce personal income taxes on the top tier of income-earners, for fear of being accused of delivering &#8220;a tax cut to the richest Canadians;&#8221; (2) Just about every government from Jean Chr\u00e9tien&#8217;s onward was eager to cut small-business tax rates, because this seemed to be a handy spur to the plucky spirit of the theoretically job-creating mom-and-pop entrepreneurial class.</p>\n<p>So, personal income tax rates stay high, while small-business taxes drop steadily. Soon it makes sense for anyone who can do it to announce that they are no longer an income-earner, they are&#8230; a <em>job-creating centre of plucky innovation</em>. The tax advantage is obvious. I&#8217;ve been advised to do it forever, by well-meaning friends: Why do you persist as a Rogers salaryman when you could contract your services as the CEO of Inkless Words Inc.? The funny thing is, nobody ever argued it would make me more entrepreneurial and innovative. The argument began and ended with tax advantage. And it probably doesn&#8217;t flatter my financial acuity to admit I never made the change.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not entirely clear to me where fairness enters into any of this. Or rather, once fairness gets into it, I have no idea how to get it out. If the stated goal of tax reform is to make it fairer, then <em>of course</em> the taxation of Bill Morneau&#8217;s company is a reasonable\u00a0question, and <em>of course</em> it&#8217;s simply weird when Morneau refuses, for days on end, to answer it.</p>\n<p>It would have been interesting to see whether the Liberals would have fared better if they&#8217;d kept fairness out of it. Their remedy on small-business taxation is similar to Jim Flaherty&#8217;s remedy to income-trust taxation early in the Conservatives&#8217; decade in office: a previously innocuous accounting practice was exploding in popularity because the tax advantage was too great to ignore. The loss in revenue was becoming a problem. Technical problem, technical solution. (The Liberals have the added advantage of having campaigned in an election for the changes they now propose, whereas the Conservatives had campaigned <em>against</em> the changes Flaherty introduced. But the situations are otherwise comparable.)</p>\n<p>The problem is, it&#8217;s really hard for Liberals to resist the temptation to claim moral superiority. &#8220;We need the revenue&#8221; is less appealing, because less flattering, than &#8220;We&#8217;re making the system fairer for all Canadians.&#8221; Self-flattery is a weakness that stalks us all, but your average Trudeau Liberal is perhaps unusually susceptible. Justin Trudeau spent Monday morning listening with a straight face while Jack Ma, the CEO of the jillion-dollar Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba, talked about the importance of &#8220;EQ, IQ and LQ&#8221; in running a successful business. LQ, in this formula, is &#8220;Love Quotient.&#8221; A steady diet of this sort of thing may dull one&#8217;s ability to spot an argument that will risk provoking listeners&#8217; gag reflex.</p>\n<p>One more thing. The other problem with Trudeau and Morneau styling themselves as champions of the working class is that they may forget that they, and a large fraction of the people they know, are fabulously wealthy. And it turns out a lot of Liberals have spent the last few years incorporating themselves to take advantage of the gap between personal income tax and small-business tax rates. That&#8217;s all the more true for Liberals who are too old, or too entrenched in their family lives, to move back to Ottawa to become political staffers again. I wonder whether Morneau is surprised by the number of Liberal activists, in Toronto and Vancouver and Montreal ridings, who feel targeted by the proposed changes and by the fairness rhetoric around them.</p>\n<p><strong>RELATED:\u00a0</strong></p>\n\t\t<div class=\"bc-video bc-video-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"player-loader\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n\t\t\t<iframe src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/video/iframe/13639244001/VJjIBwmqg/5589029358001\"\n\t\t\t\twidth=\"640\"\n\t\t\t\theight=\"360\"\n\t\t\t\tallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tmozallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; right: 0px; left: 0px;\" class=\"rdm-brightcove-videojs-iframe\"></iframe>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n<p><strong>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/tax-reform/\">TAX REFORM</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/a-tax-fight-has-canadians-on-democratic-autopilot-thats-a-problem/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>A tax fight has Canadians on democratic autopilot.

And after he <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/scheer-free-speech-universities-extreme-examples-1.4263753\" target=\"_blank\">had difficulty explaining</a> how the central plank of his Conservative leadership campaign, linking free speech on university campuses to federal research funding, would work in practice.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>WATCH MORE: 10 things to know about Conservative leader Andrew Scheer</p></blockquote>\n<p></strong><br />\n\t\t<div class=\"bc-video bc-video-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"player-loader\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n\t\t\t<iframe src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/video/iframe/13639244001/VJjIBwmqg/5452420464001\"\n\t\t\t\twidth=\"640\"\n\t\t\t\theight=\"360\"\n\t\t\t\tallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tmozallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; right: 0px; left: 0px;\" class=\"rdm-brightcove-videojs-iframe\"></iframe>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</p>\n<p>A few things about all that. First, it must be maddening to Scheer that he even has to talk about any of this, given that Justin Trudeau has launched a <a href=\"https://savelocalbusiness.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">war on the middle class</a>\u00a0from within the\u00a0tax-sheltered Trudeau-Morneau family timeshare, and Omar Khadr has been extravagantly compensated\u00a0on the public dime, and there&#8217;s a deficit and all the rest.</p>\n<p>Second, even on the specifics of the cases that are tormenting Scheer this week, there&#8217;s room to wonder whether some of the outrage on the evening political chat shows is a bit selective. True, Gerry Ritz called Catherine McKenna a Barbie. And she&#8217;s really not a Barbie. She&#8217;s a formidable lawyer whose entry into politics at the highest level has gone well. But meanwhile, four Liberal MPs have been ejected from the Liberal caucus over two years amid allegations of serious mistreatment of female colleagues or staffers. It takes chutzpah to suggest only Scheer has a problem with caucus knuckle-draggers.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/inside-andrew-scheers-unlikely-triumph/\">Inside Andrew Scheer\u2019s unlikely triumph</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>But if Scheer has anyone he trusts in his inner circle, they need to take him aside right about now and say, &#8220;Suck it up. Nobody said opposition was fair. Nobody even said it was pleasant. It is what it is. Learn how to work a job.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Scheer might want to ask Tom Mulcair how rewarding the job of opposition leader can be.\u00a0Mulcair was, by popular consent, the best at the job in many years. His party fired him for his troubles. Before Mulcair there were a couple of Liberal stumblebums, Michael Ignatieff and St\u00e9phane Dion. Before them was Stephen Harper, who had no stomach for Question Period and was second-guessed constantly as either too conservative or not enough. Before Harper\u00a0were all the opposition leaders Jean Chr\u00e9tien cheerfully dispatched: Stockwell Day, Preston Manning, Lucien Bouchard blowing out of Ottawa because Chr\u00e9tien turned out to be harder to fight than he looked. And before them all, there was Chr\u00e9tien himself, a notoriously lousy opposition leader, forever quelling open revolt from Liberal caucus naysayers by threatening or mocking them.</p>\n<p>It was before my time, but it seems to me the last opposition leader to enjoy the job as a romp straight to office was Brian Mulroney in 1984. That&#8217;s a long time ago. Hassle and woe are the more common hallmarks of the job.</p>\n<p>But Scheer&#8217;s difficulties are more than just everyday job stress. The Ritz-Beyak-Rebel troubles are not merely evidence of a vindictive Liberal press corps. They suggest emerging flaws in Scheer&#8217;s own leadership style that he&#8217;ll need to address.</p>\n<p>In all three cases, his first instinct was to hope the storm blew over. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s because Scheer underestimated the coming storm; it&#8217;s because <em>at first</em> he thought he could wear the storm as a badge of honour. Scheer fancies himself a happy warrior for free speech. He pitches his campus free speech policy as a defence of people&#8217;s right to say even upsetting things. The impression he gives is of a guy whose first instinct, when Ezra Levant or Lynn Beyak or Gerry Ritz gets into trouble, is to say, &#8220;Oh, come on; this isn&#8217;t that big a deal.&#8221; Then when it becomes a bigger deal he backtracks. This shows both a glass jaw and a limited ability to estimate the size of a deal.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think Scheer&#8217;s performance on these files is determined solely by his temperament, either. It&#8217;s also structural. He sold himself to his party as a specific kind of cure to Harperism. It&#8217;s not clear he has the luxury to\u00a0be that kind of cure.</p>\n<p>By the time Scheer became Conservative leader, many Conservatives, probably most, were heartily sick of the Harper party&#8217;s oppressive message-control mechanisms. The forms you had to fill out, the layers of approval. Opinions diverged on whether the party needed to change its <em>policy</em> direction, but in\u00a0its day-to-day communications and caucus management, the overwhelming consensus was that it\u00a0needed a lighter touch.</p>\n<p>Scheer&#8217;s selling proposition to Conservatives was that he could appeal to moderates by being a nicer guy than Harper, but that he could mollify the activist base by letting it act up a bit, without fear of reprisal. Blow off some steam. Have a few debates. The driving assumption seems to be that Harper brought the hammer down on his own people because Harper is the kind of guy who enjoys bringing the hammer down. And there&#8217;s some truth to that!</p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s also the absolutely brutal purgatory the Canadian Alliance went through for two years before Harper became that party&#8217;s leader. Plummeting in the polls. Constant MP defections from caucus. Mockery in the news coverage. To some extent, this continued through the 2004 election, which Harper believed he lost because he could not trust his own candidates not to sound crazy. That&#8217;s why he clamped down.</p>\n<p>Scheer will soon have to decide whether he can afford to let his caucus members say what they want. Until he does, the emerging pattern of his management style\u2014laissez faire, followed by hasty backtracking\u2014will come to define him.</p>\n<p>The backdrop for all of this, it&#8217;s worth remembering, is the formidable task the fates have assigned Scheer. He&#8217;s trying to defeat a new majority government after a single term. How easy is that?</p>\n<p>The historical record suggests it&#8230; may be impossible. Since Confederation there have only been two governments that were swept into power\u00a0with a majority of seats in the Commons, only to be swept right out of power at the next election. Those were the governments of Alexander Mackenzie in 1878 and R.B. Bennett in 1930. Realizing the peril they faced, each dragged out his\u00a0time in office to the full five years. Each lost the next time\u2014to the man he had beaten in the previous election. Mackenzie ran Sir John A. Macdonald out of office, only to be run out by Sir John five years later. Bennett beat Mackenzie King, only to lose to King at their next confrontation. It&#8217;s a bit like Joe Clark defeating Pierre Trudeau, only to lose to Trudeau, though Clark never had a majority. (This is why one of Harper&#8217;s worst fears during his first precarious year in power, 2006, was that Paul Martin would cancel his retirement to lead the Liberals at the next election. Or that Jean Chr\u00e9tien would.)</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s <em>never</em> happened is that a\u00a0government elected with a majority loses power to a <em>rookie</em> leader at the very next election. There&#8217;s too much momentum in power, too much willingness among voters to stick with a new-ish government and give it time. That&#8217;s the trend Andrew Scheer is trying to buck.\u00a0It can be done\u2014precedent in politics isn&#8217;t the same as laws of physics\u2014but it will be hard enough even if he does a flawless job.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/andrew-scheer-learns-his-jobs-no-fun/\">Andrew Scheer learns his job&#8217;s no fun</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/andrew-scheer-learns-his-jobs-no-fun/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>10</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>David Johnston: Before abolishing the monarchy, know what you&#8217;re getting into</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/david-johnston-before-abolishing-the-monarchy-know-what-youre-getting-into/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/david-johnston-before-abolishing-the-monarchy-know-what-youre-getting-into/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2017 15:39:42 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[David Johnston]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Governor General]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1060619</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The outgoing governor general speaks with Paul Wells about the rise of distrust in Canada, Harper's 2009 prorogation of Parliament, and what he plans to do next</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/david-johnston-before-abolishing-the-monarchy-know-what-youre-getting-into/\">David Johnston: Before abolishing the monarchy, know what you&#8217;re getting into</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>\t\t<div class=\"bc-video bc-video-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"player-loader\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n\t\t\t<iframe src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/video/iframe/13639244001/VJjIBwmqg/5579492023001\"\n\t\t\t\twidth=\"640\"\n\t\t\t\theight=\"360\"\n\t\t\t\tallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tmozallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; right: 0px; left: 0px;\" class=\"rdm-brightcove-videojs-iframe\"></iframe>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<br />\n<style>\r\n.mobileshow { display: none;}\r\n@media only screen\r\nand (max-device-width : 480px){ .mobileshow { display: inline;}}</style>\r\n<div class=\"mobileshow\" width=\"100%\">\r\n</div></p>\n<p>At seven years, David Johnston&#8217;s tenure as Canada&#8217;s governor general has been a little longer than the norm \u2014 the longest since Georges Vanier held the office from 1959 to 1967 \u2014 and it has covered a turbulent period in Canada&#8217;s political history. Johnston, a lawyer and university president before he came to Rideau Hall, welcomed <em>Maclean&#8217;s</em> to a sunlit corner of his official residence for a valedictory interview as he prepares to leave office on Oct. 2. Johnston was candid about the two prime ministers he&#8217;s served, the debates that surrounded his appointment, and the inevitable debate over the future of the monarchy in Canada.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: After just about seven years in Rideau Hall, I wonder whether you\u2019re anxious to leave, or sorry to leave?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Certainly not anxious to leave. It\u2019s been a wonderful seven years. But appropriate to leave. One is asked to do these things, typically, for a five-year term and I was asked to stay on for a further two years. It\u2019s been a joy for my wife and myself to see the country as we have.</p>\n<p>One operates one\u2019s life in a series of stages. I\u2019ve been in universities all my life and typically you take an administrative appointment for five years or six years, always expecting you\u2019ll return to being a professor \u2014 I\u2019m a professor of law. And I guess that\u2019s the way I see my life: Doing this for seven years, and doing it as well as we can, then moving on to the next stage with many more good things to do.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1058515\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1058515\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SEPT07_WELLS_GG_POST01.jpg\" alt=\"Governor General David Johnston at Rideau Hall in Ottawa September 7, 2017.

(Photograph by Blair Gable)</p></div>\n<p><strong>Q: I went back and re-read some of your speeches, including your installation speech. I was struck by how, right from the beginning, you used a term you\u2019ve used in countless public moments since then, which is that Canada is a \u201csmart and caring nation.\u201d Why was that important to you as a theme?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> First of all, because it touches the most fundamental values of the country. We\u2019re a country that does have a concern for our neighbour. We think beyond ourselves and our immediate family. And throughout our history we\u2019ve had a sense of trying to ensure that collectively we raise our communities. And try to ensure that equality of opportunity functions for all of our people, not just selected portions of our population. At the same time I think we try to do that as sagely, as wisely as we can, and that\u2019s the \u201csmart\u201d part. Especially through our public education system, one tries very hard to ensure that the opportunity to develop one\u2019s talents to the full are available to all of our citizens.</p>\n<p>This is a good country and we can do better. One of the studies I often use to illustrate this is an OECD study that looks at the 33 or so countries of the OECD on the basis of social mobility. it measures the extent to which children meet or exceed their parents\u2019 level of education. They divide each of the 33 countries into quintiles of population based on the parents\u2019 level of education. So for the top four quintiles, the top 80 per cent of our population, the children meet or exceed their parents\u2019 level of education by a greater degree than any other country. So we\u2019re number one in social mobility as measured for that 80 per cent of the population.</p>\n<p>Now, intuitively, you\u2019d think for the last 20 per cent of the population, you\u2019ve got to be up there in the top one, two or three\u00a0\u2014\u00a0rising tide lifts all boats. We\u2019re in the bottom third. Bottom third. That\u2019s such a stark contrast. And why is that so? it\u2019s because we have pockets of our population where that equality of opportunity just doesn\u2019t work. Four or five per cent of our population are indigenous people. You know the social indicators as well as I; they\u2019re totally unacceptable. Areas of our inner cities where two or three generations simply don\u2019t benefit from the equality of opportunity that we see through good public education.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/canada-must-get-serious-about-income-inequality-but-how/\" target=\"_blank\">Canada must get serious about income inequality. But how?</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Q: Can you tip your hand as to your next role after you leave Rideau Hall?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> It\u2019s by no means definite. I\u2019ve been anxious not to be fixing my next engagement while I\u2019m still in this one. But I\u2019m a law professor. I\u2019ll continue to write law books. We\u2019ll probably do a book called Trust In Canada, looking at the concept of trust. What it is, why it\u2019s important, how to encourage it. The Edelman Trust survey, for the first time in eight years, Canada is a \u201cdistrustor nation.\u201d More than 50 per cent of our population don\u2019t trust their public institutions. So we\u2019re now in the middle of the pack on that. We used to be in the top third.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: You came to office in 2010, at a time when trust in the office had been strained: by the coalition crisis of 2008, by your predecessor\u2019s decision to grant prorogation to Stephen Harper. Do you have anything to say about that decision? It\u2019s still being debated today by scholars.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> We should know more about the conventions of prorogation and dissolution. They\u2019re two different concepts. Prorogation is in fact granted quite commonly throughout the tenure of a particular government. It\u2019s on the advice of the prime minister. And a theorist would say that only in the most exceptional circumstance would the governor general exercise a right or power that the governor general has to postpone or somehow deter prorogation. Because that would be assuming to a non-elected authority, the authority that normally lies in the hands of the people who are elected to serve the country.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1058505\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1058505\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SEPT07_WELLS_GG_POST04.jpg\" alt=\"Governor General David Johnston at Rideau Hall in Ottawa September 7, 2017.

(Photograph by Blair Gable)</p></div>\n<p><strong>Q: So the guy \u2014\u00a0Stephen Harper \u2014 who came to visit her on that day, he was the prime minister, he was advising the governor general and she should take the advice? It\u2019s that straightforward?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> I don\u2019t want to get into a specific case of what\u2019s right or wrong. What I do want to emphasize is the importance of understanding those conventions. There is a theoretical basis for them, and whether one exercises them or not is a judgment in a particular circumstance.</p>\n<p>We live in a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy. Our democratic institutions must function well, and in a democratic fashion. Meanwhile, the governor general has certain responsibilities. The most important might be the responsibility Bagehot described as \u201cadvising, encouraging and warning.\u201d Warning would happen very infrequently but you certainly would use the power to warn before you would do anything as calamitous as denying a piece of legislation.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Would anyone ever find out about that, besides the prime minister and the governor general in question?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Probably not. Certainly not from the governor general.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: When you were named to this office, very soon after that crisis, to what extent did you feel like your job was to get that sort of question right the next time it was put to you?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> I felt highly responsible. I\u2019m a lawyer by trade. So first of all, we looked for the precedents we could gather, and then systematically we put together a table of potential questions that could arise \u2013\u00a0minority government, etcetera \u2014\u00a0then what we thought would be the answers to those questions and the principles on which those answers were based, and then the precedents, especially the Canadian precedents, both federally and provincially. And we\u2019ve shared that as a confidential document with the other vice-regal members.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What has your rapport been like with the two prime ministers you\u2019ve worked with, Stephen Harper and Justin Trudeau?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> My rapport with both has been very, very good. They\u2019re different individuals. Mr. Harper was very disciplined in the meetings we would have, and would have a series of issues on which we would exchange views. Mr. Trudeau is more informal and very spontaneous. I\u2019ve known him for a long time because our children played together with him and his two brothers as lovers of skiing. So we\u2019ve known him since he was six. It\u2019s been a friendship for a very long time.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Your other main interaction is with the Queen. Tell me about your last visit with her.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> It was a bit nostalgic there because we both knew it was the last time we would see each other in this capacity. Of course the Queen is now 91. She\u2019s remarkably physically and mentally acute, and it\u2019s wonderful to be with her. We\u2019ve found both her and her husband so down to earth, so warm, and in her case so very wise. Each time we\u2019ve had the chance to meet I\u2019ve had the sense of someone who\u2019s seen more history than any other living person. It\u2019s been quite a thrill to interact with her.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: She\u2019s been the monarch for every Canadian-born governor general, from Vincent Massey to you. When her reign ends, would it be an appropriate time for a debate about the role of the monarchy in Canada?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Well, I\u2019m sure there will be, as this debate is going on at all times, and appropriately so in a democracy. And other realms in the Commonwealth will have that debate. My own view is that we have an Act of Succession, the succession is clear, and my role and that of the other members of the vice-regal family is to make that as smooth as it possibly can be.</p>\n<p>When I do get into these debates, very often with schoolchildren, I say, \u2018You know, Canada has evolved since 1867. We\u2019re the product of a thousand years of constitutional history. We\u2019ve made changes, when changes were appropriate, in how we govern ourselves. But always be conscious of what it is you want. And if you\u2019re making change, why that change seems quite compelling, and what you\u2019re getting into. And if you wanted to name 10 countries around the world that seem to have government that pretty well satisfies the needs of the vast majority of people and has a degree of trust, you\u2019d probably have on that list: Denmark, Sweden, Norway, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Canada. What\u2019s common to those? They\u2019re all constitutional monarchies with vigorous parliamentary democracies.

(Chris Wattie/Reuters)</p></div>\n<p>Three travellers meet at the junction of mighty rivers. One is young and strong but his wings are tarnished. A second is younger but he can&#8217;t find his wings. The third is tired and nearly done his thankless task. Upon them rests the fate of a nation.\u00a0What a show.</p>\n<p>The venue for all this drama is the House of Commons, where Parliament resumes on Monday after a summer break that will seem, by Wednesday, to have been too short. The eyes of every political junkie in the land will converge on the Commons for Question Period\u2014and the inevitable letdown.</p>\n<p>Question Period is rarely much good on the first day back from a long break. This is only human. Too many issues have\u00a0piled up while MPs were home in their ridings, and\u00a0a sense of obligation forces opposition leaders to test-drive each of them in turn, once they finally have a chance to challenge government ministers again.</p>\n<p>So Question Period lacks focus for a while. Finally, through the play of news headlines, online outrage and telephone calls to MPs&#8217; offices, the country in effect tells parliamentarians which issues have legs. The really epic battles come later.</p>\n<p>Further muddying things is the constant distractions of life in a big country&#8217;s capital. This week there&#8217;ll be at least two of those: the <a href=\"http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2017/09/13/uk-prime-minister-theresa-may-visit-canada\" target=\"_blank\">visit on Monday of British prime minister Theresa May</a> and the United Nations General Assembly in New York from Tuesday to the end of the week. Justin Trudeau will speak to the General Assembly and some relevant ministers, Chrystia Freeland and Marie-Claude Bibeau, will be there for most of the week.</p>\n<p>But at some point, despite distractions, Parliament will get down to business. The main combatants have each had difficult summers.</p>\n<p>Justin Trudeau&#8217;s Liberals have come to realize that, as they sometimes remind one another in meetings, &#8220;hard things are hard.&#8221; This was the summer of Confederation&#8217;s\u00a0150th anniversary, and\u00a0if there ever was a spirit of celebration around that landmark, it&#8217;s long gone. In its place are glib promises proving nearly intractable, and an ever-shortening timeline for producing results.</p>\n<p>Reconciliation with Indigenous Canadians? Trudeau promised to eliminate long-term boil-water advisories in Indigenous communities. Today there are more than when he started. He&#8217;s split the Indigenous and Northern Affairs department in two and shifted an all-star minister, Jane Philpott, to one of the new departments as he doubles down on what was always going to be a difficult file.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/the-liberals-plans-for-indigenous-reconciliation-are-just-beads-and-trinkets/\" target=\"_blank\">The Liberals\u2019 plans for Indigenous reconciliation are just beads and trinkets</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The opioid crisis? Trudeau replaced Philpott at health with Ginette Petitpas Taylor, an untested rookie minister in the midst of a public health crisis. Public health activists were unconvinced by Petitpas Taylor&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/canadas-new-health-minister-faces-the-opioid-crisis/\" target=\"_blank\">first interview</a> on opioid overdoses: she said there&#8217;s a crisis but couldn&#8217;t name anything she&#8217;d do differently from her predecessor. It&#8217;s more than a crisis. Many thousands of\u00a0Canadians have lost their lives. It&#8217;s hard to imagine the chaos that would befall\u00a0any government if those deaths had been caused by a communicable disease, or by violent attack.</p>\n<p>Military procurement? It&#8217;s a farce. A decision on peacekeeping? No time soon. Pipelines? A long list of maybes. Climate change? All the hard work, and the inevitable conflict among provinces with different policies and emissions profiles, still lie ahead. Meanwhile the Trudeau government seems overwhelmed by its own agenda: it has named no new officer of Parliament, and it\u00a0can&#8217;t seem even to name a Chief\u00a0Science Advisor, which once upon a time seemed like an easy win.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-military-funding-in-canada-is-in-such-a-lousy-state/\" target=\"_blank\">Why military funding in Canada is in such a lousy state</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>And those aren&#8217;t even the riskiest files. The biggest of those seems to be Finance Minister Bill Morneau&#8217;s attempt to change the taxation of small businesses, which the opposition Conservatives are depicting as an all-out war on the very middle class Trudeau claims to hold to heart. (The Conservatives&#8217; claims are themselves <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/story/we-obtained-the-conservatives-internal-strategy-on-trudeaus-tax-changes-heres-whats-wrong-with-it\" target=\"_blank\">full of holes</a>, but they have a lot of resources to push their claims, and a lot of support from people who <a href=\"http://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/september-2017/liberal-tax-reform-fairness-and-doctors/\" target=\"_blank\">aren&#8217;t Conservatives</a>.)</p>\n<p>Trudeau&#8217;s most successful communications haven&#8217;t been crisis communications. When pushed, as he was on electoral reform, he sometimes just folds rather than try to explain himself under fire. So he&#8217;s got a tough autumn ahead of him.</p>\n<p>So does his leading designated tormentor, Andrew Scheer. Conservatives seemed to hope he&#8217;d be different from Stephen Harper in two ways: a nicer guy who&#8217;d be more overtly conservative. Those two missions may be contradictory. Barely elected to his new gig, Scheer had to navigate little storms over <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/andrew-scheer-shuns-rebel-media-1.4254375\" target=\"_blank\">the party&#8217;s relation to the imploding Rebel Media</a> and the precise meaning of his promise to <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/scheer-free-speech-universities-extreme-examples-1.4263753\" target=\"_blank\">protect free speech on university campuses</a>.</p>\n<p>Scheer heads into the fall parliamentary sitting with both lower approval numbers and lower disapproval numbers in polls than his immediate predecessor Rona Ambrose. That&#8217;s because a lot more Canadians simply don&#8217;t know him yet and don&#8217;t think much about him either way. It took Stephen Harper a losing election campaign to get over a similar deficit in 2004. Rookie leaders who defeat majority governments are rare in this country, and the governments they&#8217;ve toppled have tended to be measurably more decrepit than Trudeau&#8217;s. The young Conservative has his work cut out for him.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/andrew-scheer-leader-conservative-party-of-canada-profile/\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Scheer, the Conservative Party\u2019s folksy unifier</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The third leader of our major-party trilogy\u2014sorry, Elizabeth May and whoever&#8217;s in the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois these days!\u2014is Tom Mulcair. One hardly knows what to say. His party fired him, then asked him to stay around to lead it. At the same convention, the party voted in favour of a national consultation on the Leap manifesto. There&#8217;s been no such consultation worth mentioning. Mulcair is a formidable parliamentary fighter, but it is hardly his fault if it is never clear what the party he (still) (sort of) leads wants to be when it grows up.</p>\n<p>Mulcair is, for the moment, the guy holding the Schr\u00f6dinger box: only when it opens will we learn whether the NDP&#8217;s next leader is Jagmeet Singh or somebody else. In the meantime, the NDP remains hobbled by its own recent choices and eagerly awaiting the chance to benefit from its next one.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/parliament-returns-and-its-a-bit-of-a-mess/\">Parliament returns, and it&#8217;s a bit of a mess</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/parliament-returns-and-its-a-bit-of-a-mess/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>13</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Justin Trudeau: Look for the union label</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-look-for-the-union-label/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-look-for-the-union-label/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2017 17:41:54 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Canadian Labour Congress]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Hassan Yussuff]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Justin Trudeau]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Unifor]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1060249</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Since the Liberals won the election, Trudeau has taken care to reward Canada's big unions for their support </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-look-for-the-union-label/\">Justin Trudeau: Look for the union label</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_1060307\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1060307\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SEPT14_WELLS_UNION_POST.jpeg\" alt=\"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks during a UFCW Canada convention in Montreal, Thursday, August 31, 2017.

It&#8217;s only a modest exaggeration to say Unifor&#8217;s Jerry Dias has at times\u00a0been <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/business/2017/09/10/the-story-of-nafta-as-told-from-a-canadian-auto-parts-plant-in-mexico.html\" target=\"_blank\">easy to mistake as a Canadian government spokesman</a> in news interviews on the fringes of the NAFTA renegotiations.</p>\n<p>These groups go way back with the Trudeau Liberals. In 2015 <a href=\"http://globalnews.ca/news/2206189/labour-unions-across-canada-preparing-to-launch-major-anti-harper-offensive/\" target=\"_blank\">a group called Engage Canada</a>, backed in part by Unifor, made big ad buys to soften up Conservative support in what everyone thought were\u00a0the pre-electoral months. Harper called an early election\u2014or rather, an early start to the campaign for the fixed election date\u2014partly, it&#8217;s been conjectured, because he didn&#8217;t want those Engage Canada ads to go un-rebutted by his own messaging. It didn&#8217;t do him much good in the end.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/why-hard-hats-are-everywhere-on-the-campaign-trail/\">Why hard hats are everywhere on the campaign trail</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Big Labour&#8217;s message at the time, infuriating to the NDP, was that members should <a href=\"https://thetyee.ca/News/2015/01/09/Labour-Must-Defeat-Harper/\" target=\"_blank\">vote strategically to defeat Harper</a>, rather than support the traditionally union-aligned NDP.</p>\n<p>(Full disclosure: I&#8217;m a member of Unifor Local 87-M, which has members in most large Toronto-based news organizations.\u00a0My eternal wish is that my union\u00a0would stay out of electoral politics.)</p>\n<p>Since they won the election, the Trudeau Liberals have taken care to reward Canada&#8217;s big unions for their support. Terrance Oakey, whose union-busting organization Merit Canada used to have all kinds of friends in government during the Harper years, has of course noticed, and decried, the <a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/opinion/how-unions-got-85-million-from-the-trudeau-government-to-help-them-recruit-construction-workers\" target=\"_blank\">new pro-union attitude</a> in Justin Trudeau&#8217;s Ottawa. Not that it&#8217;s been <a href=\"http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/alberta-diary/2017/06/trudeau-government-dumps-harpers-anti-union-legislation\" target=\"_blank\">hard to miss</a>.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s pretty easy to see the game here. Partly it&#8217;s no game: a lot of Liberals simply continue to see organized labour as a powerful partner in improving life for ordinary Canadians. But partly it&#8217;s strategic, too: labour support can translate into votes, and it can help give the general impression that a government Stands Up For The Little Guy.</p>\n<p>Of course, the days when a union could reliably deliver its members&#8217; votes, if it ever existed, are long gone. But the CLC claims 3.3 million members; even if only one in 20 listens to the union&#8217;s message, that&#8217;s a handy bump at election time.</p>\n<p>The Harper Conservatives had a fun decade stealing the labour vote right out from under union leaders. These are sweeping generalizations, and there are all kinds of exceptions, but the labour vote is often blue-collar; it often has large families and a high-school or college education; it&#8217;s a stakeholder electorate that&#8217;s likely to own homes and worry about neighbourhood safety. This was the core of the Harper coalition. Until it wasn&#8217;t. (In about 2008, someone in the Harper PMO sent me a story from the <em>Sarnia Observer</em>, about Harper getting a standing ovation at a graduation ceremony for people in the skilled trades. &#8220;Ten years ago these people would have been cheering for\u00a0Chr\u00e9tien,&#8221; the PMO person wrote. One question I ask myself these days during elections is, Who&#8217;s going to get Sarnians in the skilled trades\u00a0on their feet?)</p>\n<p>There is, finally, the matter of Donald Trump, who got elected bigly with the votes of many millions of Americans who are, or were once, union members, and who came to believe\u00a0a hereditary Manhattan plutocrat could give them their hope and dignity back. In Justin Trudeau&#8217;s entourage, a lot of people have a lot of time for the notion that this happened because the Democratic Party took its eye off the working-class ball, and they are bound and determined not to make the same mistake. This determination was the pith and substance of the speech Trudeau delivered in the improbably swanky precincts of a <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/02/21/justin-trudeaus-hamburg-speech-hints-at-populist-shift-in-ottawa.html\" target=\"_blank\">black-tie dinner in Hamburg</a>.\u00a0It&#8217;s why so far, in the early going, a lot of Liberals like the emerging battle over tax changes as much as the Conservatives want to bring it to them.</p>\n<p>Conservatives lose when they are the party of fat cats. They win when they capture\u00a0the working-class vote.</p>\n<p>Andrew Scheer&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AndrewScheerMP/photos/p.1709308402436238/1709308402436238/?type=3&amp;theater\" target=\"_blank\">Labour Day message</a> this year did not mention organized labour, a plainly conscious decision that did not leave the Conservative leader\u00a0disarmed: he saluted\u00a0instead &#8220;the millions of Canadians who work tirelessly to strengthen our economy, while still finding time to give back to their communities when the workday is done. The moms and dads, grandparents, friends and neighbours who manage to coach their children\u2019s sports teams, arrange carpools, and volunteer their time for those in need.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Trudeau&#8217;s Labour Day message could hardly have been more different: a celebration, specifically, of the &#8220;discipline and dedication of organized labour&#8221; that mentioned &#8220;the union-based apprenticeship training program,&#8221; &#8220;targeted amendments to the Canada Labour Code,&#8221; and &#8220;the International Labour Organization&#8217;s Convention 98.&#8221; The PM&#8217;s long statement heads into the home stretch with: &#8220;Organized labour has a strong partner in the Government of Canada.&#8221;</p>\n<p>None of this is a guarantee of Liberal success. The Conservatives have shown in the past that they are often able to win union members&#8217; votes despite the best efforts of union leaders. A revitalized NDP, which I suppose is one possible outcome from the party&#8217;s current leadership race, could succeed in calling that party&#8217;s traditional labour constituency home.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s increasingly clear that Trudeau is the most overtly union-friendly prime minister since his father; that he has top-priority strategic reasons for pursuing the romance; and that the bosses of the big unions, at least, are eager to play ball.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/justin-trudeau/\">JUSTIN TRUDEAU</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/justin-trudeau-to-speak-at-united-nations-general-assembly/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Justin Trudeau to speak at United Nations General Assembly</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/women-in-the-real-world-not-angelina-jolie-give-meaning-to-summits/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Women in the real world, not Angelina Jolie, give meaning to summit</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/trudeau-gathers-cabinet-to-plot-course-to-2019/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Trudeau gathers cabinet to plot course to 2019</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/watch-live-justin-trudeau-at-the-women-in-the-world-canada-summit/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Watch live: Justin Trudeau at the Women in the World Canada Summit</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/towards-government-by-rotten-tomatoes/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Towards government by Rotten Tomatoes</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/trudeau-gets-earful-over-tax-reform-at-b-c-townhall/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Trudeau gets earful over tax reform at B.C. townhall</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/dominic-barton-wants-justin-trudeau-to-think-big-about-the-economy-will-he/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Dominic Barton wants Justin Trudeau to think big about the economy.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld</p></div>\n<p>Rising rates of opioid overdoses represent &#8220;a public-health crisis,&#8221; Canada&#8217;s new health minister says. But that doesn&#8217;t mean she&#8217;s willing to consider decriminalizing\u00a0new classes of drugs or offering drug replacement therapy to users.</p>\n<p>In an interview with <em>Maclean&#8217;s</em> that constituted some of her first remarks about her new portfolio, Ginette Petitpas Taylor said one of her first acts as health minister was to visit a supervised consumption site in Kelowna, B.C. The overdose crisis is &#8220;an issue that is near and dear to my heart, having worked with victims of crime and many individuals that suffer from addictions,&#8221; Petitpas Taylor said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I certainly see how this could be devastating, to individuals, to communities and to families. And the collateral damage is huge. And we are seeing the numbers right now\u2014in Kelowna and in other parts of the country. So it\u2019s certainly something that we\u2019re going to have to tackle.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/these-are-the-provinces-where-the-opioid-crisis-is-most-severe/\">These are the provinces where the opioid crisis is most severe</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Public health officials have scrambled to get on top of the opioid crisis, as fentanyl and other synthetic opioids have contributed to fast increases in the number of drug overdoses in Canada. Health Canada reports <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/substance-abuse/prescription-drug-abuse/opioids/national-report-apparent-opioid-related-deaths.html\" target=\"_blank\">2,458 apparent opioid-related deaths</a> in 2016. It&#8217;s a staggering toll. Bu contrast, in 2003, the SARS outbreak in Canada, which led to a crisis atmosphere and daily briefings by provincial officials in Ontario,\u00a0<a href=\"http://bodyandhealth.canada.com/channel/infection/sars/sars-severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">caused</a>\u00a044 deaths.</p>\n<p>Petitpas Taylor, whose <a href=\"http://pm.gc.ca/eng/minister/honourable-ginette-petitpas-taylor\" target=\"_blank\">background</a> includes work in addictions and mental health in her native New Brunswick, said she&#8217;s already focusing on the opioid crisis as a priority. &#8220;As days and months go on, we are certainly seeing the numbers increase. We compare it to last year, we\u2019re seeing that there\u2019s more overdoses and more deaths. So it\u2019s certainly a public-health crisis. And we\u2019re going to have to treat it as such.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But she stopped short of calling opioids a national public-health emergency, something British Columbia <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/b-c-first-in-canada-to-declare-public-health-emergency-after-fentanyl-overdoses/\" target=\"_blank\">did a year ago</a> and that experts and opposition MPs have <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/11/18/federal-government-should-declare-public-emergency-over-opioid-crisis-medical-experts.html\" target=\"_blank\">called for</a>\u00a0at the federal level.\u00a0&#8220;I would definitely say that it\u2019s a public-health crisis right now,&#8221; she said, but declined the stronger language.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/legal-weed-an-accidental-solution-to-the-opioid-crisis/\">Legal weed: An accidental solution to the opioid crisis?</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>And while she called for &#8220;more empathy and more compassion&#8221; for drug users, she also resisted the notion of <a href=\"https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/why-stop-with-pot-lets-decriminalize-all-drugs/article34653047/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&amp;\" target=\"_blank\">decriminalizing drug use</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No. No. Our Prime Minister has been very clear when it comes to this issue, and we are not looking at the issue of decriminalizing it at all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Some, including Sen. Vern White, a former Ottawa chief of police, have <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/vern-white-supervised-injection-drug-replacement-therapy-1.4226545\" target=\"_blank\">called for</a> &#8220;drug replacement therapy,&#8221; which would entail offering pharmaceutical drugs to anyone who shows up at a supervised consumption site. The goal would be to ensure that addicts don&#8217;t spend their day breaking the law to obtain their drugs. It&#8217;s another notion the new federal minister rejects, as did her predecessor Jane Philpott.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My mandate is really looking at addressing the opioid crisis that\u2019s going on nationally,&#8221; Petitpas Taylor said. &#8220;And our Prime Minister has been very clear with respect to our position with respect to legalizing. And the hard answer right now is &#8216;No&#8217; on that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So what can the Trudeau government do against opioids that hasn&#8217;t been tried? &#8220;I guess what we really have to also highlight is what he have done so far,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A significant investment has been made to deal with the issue of the opioid crisis. Over $100 million has been put forward, put aside to deal with the issue. So we can\u2019t overlook that. Also, ensuring that Naloxone is readily available to individuals as well. That is something that we need to make sure people are aware of. Is there still work that can be done? Absolutely. And again, for me my priority is speaking with my provincial and territorial partners to see what\u2019s happening on the ground for them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/canadas-new-health-minister-faces-the-opioid-crisis/\">Canada&#8217;s new health minister faces the opioid crisis</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/canadas-new-health-minister-faces-the-opioid-crisis/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Outside the beltway bubble, Trump\u2019s voters still believe</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/society/outside-the-beltway-bubble-trumps-voters-still-believe/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/society/outside-the-beltway-bubble-trumps-voters-still-believe/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 08 Sep 2017 15:19:55 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Society]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[World]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Charlottesville]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1058527</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>In a Kentucky town that broke with 150 years of tradition to vote for President Donald Trump, there is little sign of buyers\u2019 remorse</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/society/outside-the-beltway-bubble-trumps-voters-still-believe/\">Outside the beltway bubble, Trump\u2019s voters still believe</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_1058091\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1058091\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SEPT06_AMERICA_POST04.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"822\" height=\"462\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SEPT06_AMERICA_POST04.jpg 822w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SEPT06_AMERICA_POST04-300x168.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SEPT06_AMERICA_POST04-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SEPT06_AMERICA_POST04-600x336.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump wears a coal miner&#8217;s protective hat while addressing his supporters during a rally at the Charleston Civic Center on May 5, 2016 in Charleston, WV.

In the morning, mist rises off the lush valleys, and the trip ends at a paradox: at once deep in the American heartland, and pretty much in the middle of nowhere.</p>\n<p>The county seat is Sandy Hook, officially designated as a city but, with 622 resident souls, barely more than a village. Most mornings Sandy Hook residents with time to kill like to gather for coffee and small talk at the Frosty Freeze on Route 7.</p>\n<p>The kitchen at the Frosty Freeze can make what you want, if you don\u2019t want anything strange, and a hand-lettered sign under the television in the corner quotes from Romans: \u201cOwe no man nothing, but to love one another. He that loveth all, fulfilleth the law.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/donald-trumps-week-as-a-one-man-hurricane/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\">Donald Trump\u2019s week as a one-man hurricane</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>I visited Elliott County because it has a particular electoral history. From its formation in 1869 until 2016, it had voted for a Democrat at every presidential election, the longest streak of Democratic loyalty of any county in America. This is a stubborn loyalty. Elliott County voted for Walter Mondale over Ronald Reagan, for Michael Dukakis over George Bush, for John Kerry over George W. Bush, and\u2014admittedly by a squeaker in 2012\u2014for Barack Obama over Mitt Romney.</p>\n<p>But in 2016 the people of Elliott County took one look at the Democratic party\u2019s nominee, Hillary Clinton, and voted 70 per cent to 26 per cent for Donald Trump, snapping a streak that had lasted a century and a half.</p>\n<p>So how are they feeling about their choice?</p>\n<p>When I got there, President Trump was still in the news for his reactions to the violence in Charlottesville, Va. The Charlottesville city council intends to remove a statue honouring Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general in the Civil War. White supremacists and neo-Nazis had gathered in a \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in protest. Other people had come to protest against the hate marchers. Amid a weekend of sometimes violent confrontation, one man drove his car into a group of counter-protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. It was a horrible business.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"bc-video bc-video-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"player-loader\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n\t\t\t<iframe src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/video/iframe/13639244001/default/5540154591001\"\n\t\t\t\twidth=\"640\"\n\t\t\t\theight=\"360\"\n\t\t\t\tallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tmozallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; right: 0px; left: 0px;\" class=\"rdm-brightcove-videojs-iframe\"></iframe>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n<p>The president took a few runs at his response to all this. On Aug. 12, he condemned \u201cthis egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides\u2014on many sides.\u201d On Aug. 14 he tried again. \u201cRacism is evil,\u201d he said, reading prepared remarks that had been crafted to put the blame on one side, not many. \u201cAnd those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups.\u201d This seemed better, if woefully belated. But only a day later, Trump essentially took this second statement back.</p>\n<p>In a news conference at Trump Tower, ostensibly to discuss infrastructure spending, Trump defended the Unite the Right protesters. \u201cNot all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.\u201d Trump was particularly amazed by the prospect of removing a Confederate statue. \u201cSo, this week it\u2019s Robert E. Lee,\u201d he said. \u201cI wonder\u2014is it George Washington next week, and is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/donald-trump-the-final-chapter-fiction/\" target=\"_blank\">Donald Trump\u2019s Final Chapter</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>A few days later, at the Frosty Freeze on Route 7, there was no sign of buyers\u2019 remorse. \u201cI\u2019m rather impressed with him, myself,\u201d Wesley Lewis, 67, said of the president. \u201cI mean, his effort. I really am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe he\u2019s trying a lot,\u201d Lewis\u2019s friend Lovell Mayse, 73, replied.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to help this country.\u201d</p>\n<p>How so? \u201cWell, look here,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThey\u2019ve already opened up one of the big mines in Pennsylvania. Right now they\u2019re opening the second coal mine. And there\u2019ll be more. Fourteen per cent rise already in coal production. Things like that.\u201d All of this, I learned later, is true, though it\u2019s hardly clear Trump\u2019s policies are the cause. The demand for coal to be used in Chinese steelmaking accounts for the bulk of the production increase.</p>\n<p>At this end of Kentucky, prosperity and the fortunes of the coal mines have been synonymous for a century. A friend of coal is still hard to beat politically.</p>\n<p>As for everything else Trump has vowed to do, \u201che\u2019s working on the promises,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cHe\u2019s working on \u2018em.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/the-loneliness-of-donald-trump/\" target=\"_blank\">The loneliness of Donald Trump</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Wesley Lewis grew up in Elliott County.

All kinds of things.\u201d On this morning he was wearing denim overalls over a pink T-shirt. His slim face, with a tidy white goatee, was capped by the peak of a ball cap.</p>\n<p>If there\u2019s a typical Elliott County voter\u2014 someone who swung Republican for the first time only last year, Lewis isn\u2019t it: he hasn\u2019t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter. \u201cAnd the reason for that is because they\u2019re not morally sound enough to vote for.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the start of our chat, Lewis affected a certain skepticism about the new president. \u201cI don\u2019t know that Donald Trump is gonna be the answer for much of anything.\u201d But the more he talked, the clearer it became that for Lewis, Trump\u2019s side of any argument is pretty much the correct side.</p>\n<p>\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s not causing these riots and things,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a bunch of idiotic people looking for something to raise Cain about, and cause trouble over, that\u2019s none of their business to start with.

(Bryan Woolston/Reuters)</p></div>\n<p>Three issues got Trump elected, Mayse said. \u201cNumber one was, control the illegal aliens that\u2019s coming into this country. Have a check on \u2019em, make sure they\u2019re not lawbreakers and that they\u2019ll work.\u201d Number two was that Trump had promised to fix Obamacare. \u201cAnd number three\u2014really, in this county, state, and most others, they have given all of our jobs away, sent them overseas. The billionaires take them without any regard to our people working here. There\u2019s no jobs for high school graduates here that they can sustain themselves or support them, let alone a family.\u201d</p>\n<p>So: keep out illegal aliens, fix health care, and keep jobs in the United States. \u201cI think that\u2019s the reason that most people in Elliott County and Kentucky went Republican,\u201d Mayse said.</p>\n<p>And how\u2019s it going so far? After all, Trump hasn\u2019t managed to put a dent in Obamacare, and it\u2019s hard to see any evidence he\u2019s bringing jobs home. (Here in Elliott County, unemployment is stuck around 10 per cent, more than double the national average.)</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, the number one thing that I think he\u2019s done is, he has tried,\u201d Mayse said.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/how-free-expression-is-being-gagged-by-anti-trump-backlash/\" target=\"_blank\">How free expression is being gagged by anti-Trump backlash</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Trump\u2019s efforts on immigration scored especially high with these two. \u201cWe\u2019re all big believers in charity here,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cBut it\u2019s like Lovell said, lettin\u2019 these illegal immigrants in here, and then idolizing them, supporting them and all this, while they kill people that were born and raised here\u2014or came here legally\u2014that\u2019s not kosher.\u201d</p>\n<p>Study after study shows that immigrants are less likely to commit crime than native-born Americans. Lewis and Mayse did not seem to be in the market for rebuttal.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis thing with the\u2014supporting this transgender stuff? Now, pooh-pooh. That\u2019s what I say,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI say build them an island somewhere and put them on it.\u201d</p>\n<p>As I pondered which end of that to handle, he said: \u201cHere\u2019s a statement or an idea or a thought. He is, what, 71 years old?\u201d This is indeed the president\u2019s age.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is always working. Always. He\u2019s so busy doing things for the people of this country that I wonder how he rests, myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>I have, I said, fairly often seen Trump on a golf course. The website Politifact says that by Aug. 1 of their inauguration year, Trump had played golf on 21 days, Obama on 11.</p>\n<p>Lewis was unswayed. \u201cHow many\u2014in person\u2014how many days have you seen him on the golf course?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>None, I said, but there are photos. At this, Lewis was triumphant. \u201cBut what you see\u2014you saw that on television!\u201d he said. \u201cThey impress things on people\u2019s minds by way of television, radio, media\u2014I tell you, they\u2019s a lot more murky business through the media than there is through Donald Trump or anybody else.\u201d</p>\n<p>The more he considered Trump against the forces arrayed against him, Lewis said, he was left wondering why he hadn\u2019t registered Republican a long time ago. Much of the answer lay in force of habit: Elliott County is still a Democrat county, where Democrats hold most local elected office. But where did that come from?</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that was just the way that it was,\u201d Mayse said. \u201cAt that time, the Democrats were the poor people. And the Republicans were the rich.\u201d Now it\u2019s more or less flipped around, as far as they see it. A Republican president is bringing back the coal trucks. Democrats won\u2019t stop talking about climate change.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe thing about this environmental thing \u2014and you can quote me on this,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cClimate change? That is hogwash. It is. This\u2014the climates, the atmosphere, the elements, everything that\u2019s been here since God created it, has been changing, and it was changing before there was nearly as many people on this earth as what there is now.\u201d</p>\n<p>The height of foolishness, Mayse said, was this business of taking Confederate soldiers\u2019 statues down. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be the most idiotic thing.\u201d The Confederacy is a part of history, both men and others in Elliott County insisted. What\u2019s the point in taking history down? The Civil War, Mayse said, \u201cwasn\u2019t over the slaves to start with, in my opinion. It was that the North couldn\u2019t stand the South having all of that free labour.\u201d So the Civil War was not over slavery, but \u201cfree labour.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s many, many good works to support that belief,\u201d Mayse told me.</p>\n<p>Back in Lexington, an almost unbelievably more affluent city surrounded by impeccably manicured horse farms, Russell Allen met me at an Irish pub in a shopping plaza near the airport. Allen is 29, works in health-care information, and records hip-hop music as R.E.A.L. Tha Poet. For the last year he\u2019s been a volunteer activist with Take Back Cheapside, a community group dedicated to getting two Confederate statues taken down from their perches next to Lexington\u2019s old town hall. A few days earlier, the group had scored a major victory: Lexington city council had voted unanimously to remove the statues. But since it needs to find some other place to put them, the statues remained in place, and Take Back Cheapside was on hold, waiting to see what would happen next.</p>\n<p>Did Allen grow up wishing he could be part of a movement to take down Confederate statues? \u201cI never had any aspiration to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of times, especially being a minority, it seemed quite far away or impossible, just given the structure of the statues. They\u2019re so large and they sit up so high. And that\u2019s kind of the point we\u2019re making: that mentally, those type of statues have an effect on how black people see themselves. And going across the United States, how other Americans feel.\u201d</p>\n<p>Take Back Cheapside gets its name from the plaza next to the old town hall. For decades it was the largest slave market in the South. For Allen and his colleagues, this fact emphasizes the constant power struggle over who controls depictions of history. There was a plaque commemorating Cheapside\u2019s contribution to chattel slavery, paid for in 2003 by Kappa Alpha Psi, a historically black fraternity. It was vandalized in 2015. Its replacement is in storage, awaiting major renovations to the town hall itself. But even by the time it made its first appearance in 2003, the statue of John C. Breckinridge had stood around the corner for 116 years.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1058085\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1058085\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SEPT06_AMERICA_POST01.jpg\" alt=\"Statue of Confederate General John Cabell Breckinridge in Lexington, Kentucky\" width=\"822\" height=\"462\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SEPT06_AMERICA_POST01.jpg 822w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SEPT06_AMERICA_POST01-300x168.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SEPT06_AMERICA_POST01-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SEPT06_AMERICA_POST01-600x336.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A man walks past the monument for former U.S. Vice President and Confederate General John Cabell Breckinridge outside the Old Courthouse in Lexington, Ky., U.S., August 15, 2017. (Bryan Woolston/Reuters)</p></div>\n<p>Breckinridge is a good symbol of the divisions that racked Kentucky for decades before the Civil War and have not often left the state in peace since. Kentucky was a slave state. Breckinridge spent two terms in the House of Representatives defending slavery. In 1856 he was elected Vice President of the United States. He served for a term under President James Buchanan. In 1860, he ran for president, essentially defending the South\u2019s right to hold slaves and finishing a distant second to Abraham Lincoln.</p>\n<p>Foiled as he surely knew he would be for the presidency, Breckinridge went to Washington as a Kentucky senator until he joined the Confederacy\u2014as many Kentuckians did, even though the state itself never seceded. By the war\u2019s end he was the Confederate Secretary of War. Later he toured much of the world as a Confederate fugitive, living briefly in Cuba, Europe, the Middle East\u2014and Toronto, where Mrs. Breckinridge found enough expat Confederates \u201cto form quite a pleasant society among ourselves.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>MORE:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/democracy-cant-be-taken-for-granted-charlottesville-proves-that/\" target=\"_blank\">Democracy can\u2019t be taken for granted. Charlottesville proves that.</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>By the time Breckinridge came home in 1869 he was greeted as a hero. When he died six years later, the Kentucky General Assembly set aside $10,000 for his monument, but voted 23 to 1 against giving any money to a statue of a Union officer. This in a state that had stayed and fought with the Union throughout the war.</p>\n<p>Newspapers in the North took note. \u201cThus are we conciliated,\u201d a <i>New York Times</i> editorial mocked. The <i>Cincinnati Gazette</i> asked, \u201cWhat shall be the moral to young Kentuckians?\u201d</p>\n<p>I get all of this Breckinridge stuff from a fascinating 2010 book, <i>Creating a Confederate Kentucky: The Lost Cause and Civil War Memory in a Border State</i>, by Anne Marshall, a Kentucky-born associate professor of history at Mississippi State University. Marshall starts with a quote from E. Merton Coulter, a noted Southern historian, to the effect that Kentucky \u201cwaited until after the war was over to secede from the Union.\u201d She sets out to show how that happened. Led largely by Confederate women\u2014who had often held positions akin to CEOs on large plantations\u2014Kentuckians soon joined the rest of the South in regarding the Civil War as Lincoln\u2019s assault against their noble autonomy.</p>\n<p>And in a pattern that has become familiar to anyone following the debates over Confederate statues across the U.S., these pushes to \u201ccommemorate\u201d one skewed and self-interested side of the war\u2019s history bubbled up every time African-Americans sought to affirm their own rights. Lexington\u2019s second statue, honouring a dashing but unlucky Confederate general named John Hunt Morgan, went up in 1911, just as state after state was passing Jim Crow laws to roll back African-Americans\u2019 early civil-rights gains.</p>\n<p>In August Marshall wrote an opinion article for the <i>Lexington Herald-Leader</i> calling for the statues of Breckinridge and Morgan to come down. It was a late conversion, she said. As recently as 2012, as a young historian of the South, she hoped for the success of Freedom Park, an effort in Louisville to provide context to that city\u2019s Confederate monument. \u201cDesigned by both historians and community members, the park includes multiple interpretive panels, which present and honor the struggle for black freedom over the course of the city\u2019s history,\u201d Marshall wrote.</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t work. \u201cIn a present in which racial injustice pervades the everyday life of so many, it turns out that no amount of historical context is particularly helpful,\u201d Marshall wrote. \u201cThe public continued to protest and the city and the university responded by removing the statue last year.\u201d I asked Marshall about the statues and the aftermath of Charlottesville. The failure of Louisville\u2019s Freedom Park \u201cwas a real revelation for me,\u201d she said. \u201cHistorians are pretty good at explaining context in the past. But we\u2019re terrible, just like everybody else, at controlling context in the present. So in the end I think we have to answer to the context in the present and realize that it really is time for [the statues] to come down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Surely they won\u2019t all come down. Louisville\u2019s Confederate memorial didn\u2019t even leave public view. In May it simply moved an hour down the road to Brandenburg, Ky. Men in Confederate regalia saluted as the monument was rededicated to its original mission of keeping the losers\u2019 revisionist history of the Civil War alive on the soil of a Union state.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1058079\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1058079\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SEPT06_AMERICA_POST02.jpg\" alt=\"DeBraun Thomas of Take Back Cheapside\" width=\"822\" height=\"462\" srcset=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SEPT06_AMERICA_POST02.jpg 822w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SEPT06_AMERICA_POST02-300x168.jpg 300w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SEPT06_AMERICA_POST02-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SEPT06_AMERICA_POST02-600x336.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">DeBraun Thomas, of Lexington, Ky., center, with the group Take Back Cheapside, reacts after the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Council unanimously voted on Thursday, Aug. 17, 2017 to move two Confederate-era statues from downtown Lexington at the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government Center in Lexington, Ky. (Alex Slitz/Lexington Herald-Leader/TNS/Getty Images)</p></div>\n<p>This is not entirely surprising. History is always a struggle over the interpretation of the past in light of today. In another survey of the post-bellum history wars in the South, <i>Remembering the Civil War: Reunion and the Limits of Reconciliation</i>, Purdue University historian Caroline E. Janney traces the methods and institutions Southern revisionists used to rewrite the war\u2019s history over decades. That struggle was already well underway in 1871 when Frederick Douglass, the former slave and pioneering civil-rights activist, spoke at a Memorial Day service in Arlington, Va.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are sometimes asked in the name of patriotism to forget the merits of this fearful struggle, and to remember with equal admiration those who struck at the nation\u2019s life, and those who struck to save it,\u201d Douglass said; \u201cthose who fought for slavery and those who fought for liberty and justice. I am no minister of malice, I would not repel the repentant, but may my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if I forget the difference between the parties to that bloody conflict. I may say if this war is to be forgotten, I ask in the name of all things sacred what shall men remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>Today the President of the United States seems, on occasion, unsure of when or whether Frederick Douglass has yet died, and he keeps scrupulously equal admiration for those who struck the nation and those who saved it. At the end of the snaky road to Elliott County, and in countless other corners of the land, there are voters who are happy Donald Trump is there and content to let him continue his work.</p>\n<p>Russell Allen, from Take Back Cheapside, stands ready to continue his own work for as long as it\u2019s needed. In Kentucky and across the even deeper South, \u201cthere was never a reckoning with defeat and what it means,\u201d Allen said. \u201cAnd there was never a reckoning with what the men [who led the Confederacy] actually said. Because if you go back in history and look at all the defectors, the seceders, the governors, the generals, it\u2019s explicitly mentioned that the reasons that they decided to secede were for slavery.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeople say it was economic and people were infringing on them, but the fact is, they were infringing on their right to own people. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve never reckoned with on a large scale in America.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>MORE ABOUT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/donald-trump/\">DONALD TRUMP</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/donald-trumps-week-as-a-one-man-hurricane/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Donald Trump\u2019s week as a one-man hurricane</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/new-canadian-trade-data-complicates-nafta-negotiations/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>New Canadian trade data complicates NAFTA negotiations</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/barack-obamas-statement-on-donald-trump-ending-daca-cruel/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Obama and Biden blast Trump for ending DACA.

On <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/brett_ratner/\" target=\"_blank\">Brett Ratner&#8217;s page</a>, we learn that he&#8217;s hard at work directing <em>Beverly Hills Cop 4</em>, after making such hits as <em>Rush Hour</em> (Tomato Score: 60 per cent), <em>Rush Hour 2</em> (52 per cent), <em>Rush Hour 3</em> (18 per cent), and the 1997 Chris Tucker-Charlie Sheen buddy pic <em>Money Talks</em>, which managed a Tomato Score of 16 per cent.</p>\n<p>Oddly, the Rotten Tomato page for <em>Money Talks</em> claims the critics have reached &#8220;No consensus yet.&#8221; Sounds like they&#8217;re just reluctant to deliver the news. Anyway, you can see why Brett Ratner is nervous, even though he stays out of hell by producing or executive-producing prestige films like <em>The Revenant</em> and the Holocaust meta-documentary <em>Night Will Fall</em>.</p>\n<p>In my house, especially among the younger residents, it&#8217;s fashionable to proclaim no respect at all for &#8220;what Rotten Tomatoes says,&#8221; although usually there&#8217;s an awkward silence after each attempt to buck the trend. Turns out<em> Now You See Me 2</em> (34\u00a0per cent) really did suck!\u00a0I&#8217;ve found the thing to be pretty reliable: it seems to average out the quirks of its hundreds of critics, balancing, say, the spectacular world-weary\u00a0naysaying of just about every <em>Globe and Mail</em> critic against the unflagging willingness of Peter Travers of <em>Rolling Stone</em> to wolf down\u00a0whatever he&#8217;s fed and beg for more.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s just possible, using no more sophisticated a tool than one&#8217;s eyeballs, to see a real Rotten Tomatoes influence on box-office success. What it <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> look like is a tendency to goose revenues for the sort of highbrow fare that only a critic could love. The <a href=\"http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2017&amp;p=.htm\" target=\"_blank\">year-to-date chart</a> on Box Office Mojo for 2017 shows a familiar mix of superhero films, sequels, reboots and the odd quirky indie release: Disney&#8217;s <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> at top, followed by <em>Wonder Woman</em> and <em>Spider-Man</em>, furious car chases and Lego crusaders. The surprises are Christopher Nolan&#8217;s relentless <em>Dunkirk</em> and Jordan Peele&#8217;s lightly subversive thriller <em>Get Out</em>.</p>\n<p>What these films have in common is that they scored high on the Tomatometer, with <em>Despicable Me 3</em>, a more or less obligatory sortie for any family with tweens, the low outlier at 61\u00a0per cent. You used to get a lot more terrible crud raking in the big bucks at the box office. In fact, the top 10 highest-grossing films of 2017 to date have an average Tomato Score of 83.9\u00a0per cent, whereas the top 10 movies of a random year in prehistory, 1989, scored an average of 75.9\u00a0per cent. Nineteen eighty-nine was the year of Steve Martin&#8217;s <em>Parenthood</em> (93 per cent), but also of <em>Ghostbusters 2</em> (53\u00a0per cent) and <em>Look Who&#8217;s Talking</em> (58\u00a0per cent).</p>\n<p>A lot has been written about the current polarized film industry, with mega-budget superhero films at one end, and at the other, tiny independent films that struggle for an audience. But both do well with critics. I&#8217;m feeling superhero fatigue just like you, but <em>Wonder Woman</em> and <em>Spider-Man</em>: <em>Homecoming</em> were clearly the product of industrial-scale efforts to find and flatter\u00a0the human heart. And neither of them kept <em>Get Out</em> from finding an audience out of all proportion to its budget, though compared to the low returns for other indie films, that looks like a lottery win.</p>\n<p>What flops reliably these days is the movies that richly deserve to flop, the ones that aren&#8217;t\u00a0even trying, <em>CHiPS</em> and <em>Baywatch</em>. The modern equivalents of Whoopi Goldberg&#8217;s oeuvre. If a curated movie-critic aggregator succeeds in spreading the word that those films aren&#8217;t worth your time, I&#8217;m all for it.</p>\n<p>Still, you can understand the attitude of the Hollywood executives, who had grown up assuming they&#8217;d have a few weeks\u00a0to extract money from distracted audiences before their latest product began to put off a truly impenetrable stench. It can&#8217;t be as fun to make awful movies as it used to be. Life is just easier if nobody is keeping tabs on you.</p>\n<p>This backlash against evidence and independent verification is obvious in fields way more mundane than movies. In my own line of work, it&#8217;s easy to find journalists who believe it&#8217;ll kill the business to monitor the online readership of every article. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/when-silicon-valley-took-over-journalism/534195/\" target=\"_blank\">Here&#8217;s one of those journalists now</a>. In politics, there&#8217;s a characteristic frostiness, if not outright hostility, toward any outsider who dares to provide a second opinion on the wonderful work the government is doing.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to make fun of Donald Trump when he points to the media risers at his rallies, all but granting his followers license to attack the assembled journalists. But Trump is hardly alone. French president Emmanuel Macron, last month&#8217;s tiny perfect progressive reformer, is now engaged in a scowling battle with French reporters, whom he judges &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/05/journalists-interested-says-emmanuel-macron-defending-speaking/\" target=\"_blank\">too self-absorbed</a>&#8221; to be worth his time.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s not just journalistic scrutiny that chafes. More systematic and objective evaluation can also be hard for politicians to bear. Last year when province-wide standardized math tests for Ontario schoolkids gave disappointing results, <a href=\"http://globalnews.ca/news/2953420/education-minister-mitzie-hunter-to-make-an-announcement-at-j-r-wilcox-school/\" target=\"_blank\">Ontario&#8217;s Liberal government played for time</a>, promising $60 million worth of classroom reforms would bring better results. When they didn&#8217;t, Kathleen Wynne <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-curriculum-refresh-1.4276809\" target=\"_blank\">decided</a> the real problem was the tests. Maybe if they&#8217;re easier\u2014sorry, more focussed on &#8220;transferable life skills&#8221;\u2014the marks will be\u00a0better! It&#8217;s hard to believe this doesn&#8217;t have more to do with a looming election drubbing than with any real Damascene conversion in educational philosophy.</p>\n<p>Here in Justin Trudeau&#8217;s Ottawa, the preference for impressionistic over measurable indices of progress continues. It&#8217;s taking forever to name <a href=\"https://www.hilltimes.com/2017/03/13/trudeau-still-hasnt-appointed-single-parliamentary-watchdog/98892\" target=\"_blank\">new officers of Parliament</a>, the traditional watchdogs of any government. To its credit, the government backed off a bunch of changes that would have seriously weakened the Parliamentary Budget Officer, but the <a href=\"https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/is-justin-trudeau-hoping-to-silence-the-parliamentary-budget-officer/article34910033/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&amp;\" target=\"_blank\">original instinct</a> was worrisome.</p>\n<p>Then there is the mysterious disappearance, at least as a public, visible aspect of the government&#8217;s work, of deliverology, the fabled system for <em>publicly</em> tracking government performance against <em>public</em> targets. When I wrote about this <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/12/16/few-signs-justin-trudeau-has-delivered-on-promises-paul-wells.html\" target=\"_blank\">last year</a>,\u00a0in a column that elicited grumbles of displeasure from Parliament Hill, I quoted from a 2014 speech by Martin O&#8217;Malley, the former Maryland governor, whose commitment to public accountability was extraordinary.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the first precepts\u201d in O&#8217;Malley&#8217;s theory of public administration, he said,\u00a0\u201cis \u2018Timely, accurate information shared by all.\u2019 And it\u2019s amazing how many people will want to recite those tenets\u2014and they always want to leave off the phrase \u2018shared by all.\u2019 You mean, shared by managers? No, I mean shared by all. You mean shared by the leader or the council members and, like, the second-tier managers? No, I mean shared by all: People on the front line\u2014and citizens.\u201d</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a scary notion. It&#8217;s easier to face the inevitable and perfectly human disappointments of public life if you don&#8217;t have a watchdog or a website looking over your shoulder. Of course, elected officials often face harsh fates no matter what their attitude toward scrutiny. Reducing the scrutiny merely delays the reckoning, but in that delay there&#8217;s room for just a glimmer of irresistible hope.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/towards-government-by-rotten-tomatoes/\">Towards government by Rotten Tomatoes</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/towards-government-by-rotten-tomatoes/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Andrew Scheer walks a tightrope as he builds his shadow cabinet</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/andrew-scheer-builds-his-team/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/andrew-scheer-builds-his-team/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 30 Aug 2017 21:22:13 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Andrew Scheer]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Brad Trost]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[conservative party of canada]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Kellie Leitch]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Maxime Bernier]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[pierre poilievre]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[shadow cabinet]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1056595</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Kellie Leitch and Brad Trost are shut out, Maxime Bernier is denied the finance portfolio\u2014and just maybe, the world is unfolding as it should</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/andrew-scheer-builds-his-team/\">Andrew Scheer walks a tightrope as he builds his shadow cabinet</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_1056633\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1056633\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/AUG30_NTV_SCHEER_POST01.jpg\" alt=\"Leader of the Official Opposition and Leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, Andrew Scheer, makes an announcement and holds a media availability at the National Press Theatre in Ottawa on Thursday, July 20, 2017.

(Sean Kilpatrick/CP)</p></div>\n<p>Andrew Scheer\u2019s selling proposition as leader of the Conservative Party seems to be that he can calm two groups of people who disliked Stephen Harper.</p>\n<p>On one hand, there are swing voters who might have voted Conservative once or more in 2004, 2006, 2008 or 2011, but who had decided by 2015 that Harper was too angry, reclusive, or otherwise unacceptable as Conservative leader. These are the voters who, theoretically, could be recaptured if the Conservatives were to more diligently police their \u201ctone.\u201d People who will never vote Conservative surely don&#8217;t believe tone is enough, but believe me, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXJoxEGOcOA\" target=\"_blank\">the Harper Conservatives really used to work hard on tone</a>, back when they were winning.</p>\n<p>The other component of the expanded Scheer coalition is\u2026 not the same as the skittish \u201ctone\u201d voters. That&#8217;s the dyed-in-the-wool Conservative activists who found Harper disappointing because he too often seemed to be reining them in, holding them back, telling them to\u00a0be less libertarian, less hawkish, less socially conservative than they wanted to be. For the sake of the broader coalition, you understand. This was the famous Harper incrementalism, about which a guy could write a whole book, theoretically. But to many conservative Conservatives, it chafed.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/andrew-scheer-leader-conservative-party-of-canada-profile/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Scheer, the Conservative Party\u2019s folksy unifier</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>I guess Scheer expects he can\u00a0woo\u00a0both groups because he&#8217;s a complex guy: more good-humoured than Harper, but also more willing to let conservatives be conservative. The &#8220;shadow cabinet&#8221; the new Conservative leader released on Wednesday begins to put some meat on the bones of that offer. It suggests Scheer has begun to grapple with the complexity and difficulty of his job.</p>\n<p>The big surprises:</p>\n<p>\u2022 Maxime Bernier, who was ahead of Scheer on 12 of 13 ballots in May&#8217;s leadership election, is not the finance critic as he wanted to be.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Pierre Poilievre, who rubs a lot of people the wrong way, <em>is</em> the finance critic.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Two of Scheer&#8217;s leadership rivals, the identity-politics-obsessed Kellie Leitch and the Christian conservative standard-bearer Brad Trost, don&#8217;t have any critic assignment at all. Neither does Gerry Ritz, who was Harper&#8217;s agriculture minister for most of a decade.</p>\n<p>Many of these choices are easy to explain. Some of the critic assignments are\u00a0pretty smart. (I think people will notice Marilyn Gladu, the MP for my hometown of Sarnia, who becomes health critic where she\u2019ll build on her growing reputation as a personable and diligent MP. And appointing Peter Kent as &#8220;shadow minister for ethics&#8221; may turn out to have been a masterstroke. Kent is so far proving much better cut out for opposition than he was for government.) Taken together, however, they suggest some of the pitfalls of attempting to appeal to both moderate voters and highly motivated partisans.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>WATCH:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/multimedia/video/peter-kent-60-seconds/\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Kent takes the 60-Second Challenge</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The demotions for Trost and Leitch will please Canadians who thought the Conservatives were drifting into right-wing, nativist territory. But between them, the two had 15% of Conservatives&#8217; support on\u00a0the first ballot\u00a0of the leadership vote.</p>\n<p>Maybe Scheer\u2019s assumption is that Michelle Rempel, who remains the party&#8217;s immigration critic, can keep\u00a0the party current\u00a0among voters who worry about the influx of asylum-seekers, with less of Leitch\u2019s awesome tone deafness. But 15% of the party is a lot of people to disappoint by snubbing their champions.</p>\n<p>And for what? Putting Poilievre in Finance\u00a0endangers\u00a0a lot of the goodwill Scheer might have hoped to gain by ditching Trost and Leitch.\u00a0I&#8217;m not going to lie to you, I\u2019m fond of Poilievre, who\u2019s way more thoughtful, erudite and well-read than his pointing-and-blaming Commons persona might indicate. But that persona has turned off a lot of voters, and if Poilievre wants to reinvent himself, it&#8217;ll take time to execute the pivot.</p>\n<p>On to Bernier. Scheer owes him more than most recent party leaders have owed any rival. But it&#8217;s not clear how he could have satisfied Bernier. Making the hale Beauce MP finance critic was out of the question. The two men simply disagree on too much. Bernier&#8217;s against supply management; could he credibly defend it for a leader who supports it? Similar questions could be asked on taxation, on funding the CBC, and more. It would be way too easy for the Liberals to drive wedges between the two.</p>\n<p>But on Twitter, where admittedly people go to grumble, there&#8217;s already grumbling among Bernier supporters who think their man has been snubbed.</p>\n<p>Being a persuasive opposition leader isn&#8217;t the work of a day, it&#8217;s the work of months, and there\u2019s every reason to suspect Scheer\u2019s \u201cshadow cabinet\u201d will have days when it&#8217;s successful at boxing the Trudeau Liberals&#8217; ears back. But it&#8217;s easy to imagine yourself as both nicer and more audacious than your predecessor; harder to deliver.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE ABOUT THE\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/tag/conservative-party-of-canada/\">CONSERVATIVE PARTY OF CANADA</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/andrew-scheer-beer-interview/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>A beer with Andrew Scheer: Tories\u2019 leader, popcorn addict\u2026 feminist?</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/the-tory-mp-who-made-his-peace-with-pride-week/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Tory MP who made his peace with Pride Week</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/rona-ambroses-advice-for-canadian-women-considering-politics/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Rona Ambrose\u2019s advice for Canadian women considering politics</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-yes-this-is-andrew-scheers-first-rodeo/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Why yes, this is Andrew Scheer\u2019s first rodeo</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/the-conservatives-dont-show-up-for-pride-and-thats-a-problem/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Conservatives don\u2019t show up for Pride, and that\u2019s a problem</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/where-the-conservatives-go-from-here/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Where the Conservatives go from here</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/can-andrew-scheer-fix-the-conservative-partys-diversity-problem/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Can Andrew Scheer fix the Conservative Party\u2019s diversity problem?</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/an-insiders-view-of-the-final-week-of-andrew-scheers-campaign/?utm_source=macleans&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=recirc&amp;utm_content=tag_list\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>An insider\u2019s view of the final week of Andrew Scheer\u2019s campaign</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/andrew-scheer-builds-his-team/\">Andrew Scheer walks a tightrope as he builds his shadow cabinet</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/andrew-scheer-builds-his-team/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>7</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Playing the Jane Philpott card: Trudeau shuffles the deck</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/playing-the-jane-philpott-card-trudeau-shuffles-the-deck/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/playing-the-jane-philpott-card-trudeau-shuffles-the-deck/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2017 20:12:19 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[cabinet shuffle]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Picks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Jane Philpott]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Justin Trudeau]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1055785</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Justin Trudeau looks to one of his most capable cabinet ministers to deliver on Indigenous affairs, one of the government's thorniest files</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/playing-the-jane-philpott-card-trudeau-shuffles-the-deck/\">Playing the Jane Philpott card: Trudeau shuffles the deck</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_882389\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/PHILPOTT.jpg\" alt=\"Health Minister Jane Philpott to testifies about the federal government&#039;s controversial bill on assisted dyingl before the entire Senate in Ottawa, Wednesday, June 1, 2016.

Trudeau is turning into a fan of <em>mid-sized shuffles</em> that fix the worst problems and target new opportunities, all while moving a fairly small number of bodies.</p>\n<p>\u2022 When you&#8217;re really good in this government, you get moved. This is the second smallish shuffle in a year; the first was designed to <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-government-cabinet-shuffle-2017-1.3928723\" target=\"_blank\">maximize the capabilities of Chrystia Freeland</a>, who was already the most important trade minister since John Crosbie and would now be lead\u00a0minister in a Trump-responsive foreign-policy apparatus. Monday&#8217;s shuffle mainly rewards Jane Philpott, who has been a superb health minister, with new headaches in a newly created portfolio as Minister of Indigenous Services.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Nobody has tenure and nobody is barred. Cabinet sometimes looks, to backbenchers, like an exclusive club they have no hope of entering. And too often it has been taken by incumbents as a membership they can never screw up. This boss demotes: Kent Hehr takes a clear step down, although I presume the PMO will heartily dismiss the notion. And Trudeau\u00a0keeps promoting near-unknowns to key roles. I have never known Ginette Petitpas Taylor to do more than enthusiastically recite her briefing notes, and now she&#8217;s Canada&#8217;s minister of health, in the middle of an opioid crisis. Maybe it&#8217;s a genius move! We&#8217;ll soon find out.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s focus on Philpott. Thirteen months, ago I <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/07/29/jane-philpott-making-her-mark-in-trudeau-cabinet-paul-wells.html\" target=\"_blank\">wrote about</a> the breadth of her engagement and her ability to deliver results. Not all of her successes were high-profile: early on, for instance, she chaired a temporary cabinet committee in charge of getting 25,000 Syrian refugees into Canada. Later she got the government&#8217;s assisted-dying legislation through the Commons and Senate. She has rapidly overhauled the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, instituting changes the country&#8217;s medical researchers have mostly applauded.</p>\n<p>Big challenges still lay ahead, I wrote last year, including negotiations with the provinces over health funding. In December those talks <a href=\"http://www.news1130.com/2016/12/19/quebec-threatens-to-walk-out-of-health-talks-if-ottawa-doesnt-budge/\" target=\"_blank\">looked like a fiasco</a> as the provinces walked out rather than accept Philpott&#8217;s offer of (frankly not very much) targeted money for mental-health programs. But then the provinces started signing one-off bilateral deals with Philpott to take what she&#8217;d offered. Two months ago the last holdout, Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister, said he&#8217;d cheerfully <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/pallister-ottawa-health-accord-funding-pc-government-1.4184622\" target=\"_blank\">wait &#8220;forever&#8221;</a> before signing with Philpott; forever turned out to mean <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/funding-health-manitoba-1.4255391\" target=\"_blank\">seven more weeks</a>.</p>\n<p>On to her new job. The <a href=\"http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2017/08/28/new-ministers-support-renewed-relationship-indigenous-peoples\" target=\"_blank\">division of Indigenous Affairs into two departments</a> with two ministers leaves\u00a0a lot to digest, and a lot will depend on how it&#8217;s carried out. It suggests the Prime Minister is not content with progress on the file to date, and has chosen to (almost literally) double down rather than giving up. It&#8217;s based on recommendations from the <a href=\"https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100014597/1100100014637\">Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples</a>, whose 4,000-page report was published during Jean Chr\u00e9tien&#8217;s first mandate. That report has gathered dust for 20 years, but the division Trudeau delivered today was indeed one of its recommendations.</p>\n<p>Nor is it clear that Philpott&#8217;s is the hardest task of the two. Carolyn Bennett leads a new department of Crown-Indigenous Relations designed to &#8220;guide the Government\u2019s forward-looking and transformative work to create a new relationship with Indigenous Peoples&#8230; and to develop a framework to advance a recognition of rights approach that will last well beyond this government.&#8221; What&#8217;s the upper limit on something like that? Guaranteed Indigenous representation on the Supreme Court, or in Parliament? Federal transfers to self-governing Indigenous communities on the model of transfers to provinces? I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m spit-balling, but Bennett sure doesn&#8217;t seem to have a mandate to think small.</p>\n<p>Philpott&#8217;s concerns are more day-to-day. She has been thinking about them for a long time. She delivered an update on her thinking in her <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/news/2017/08/cma_speech_-_janephilpott-august212017.html\" target=\"_blank\">keynote address</a> to last week&#8217;s annual meeting of the Canadian Medical Association in Quebec City.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Of all the challenges that confront me as federal health minister, the most daunting is the need to address deplorable gaps in health outcomes faced by First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis peoples in Canada,&#8221; she said. &#8220;By a host of measures,&#8221; it is easy to see Indigenous communities &#8220;have suffered from both negligence and systemic discrimination when it comes to healthcare.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal says that <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/blackstock-human-rights-tribunal-2017-1.4038595\" target=\"_blank\">discrimination continues</a> under the Trudeau government, and has issued three compliance orders concerning child and family services on reserves. Philpott&#8217;s response was to <a href=\"http://aptnnews.ca/2017/06/23/trudeau-liberals-take-human-rights-tribunal-to-court-over-first-nation-children-ruling/\" target=\"_blank\">take the tribunal to court</a>. A matter of &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jordans-principle-first-nations-health-tribunal-court-1.4175327\" target=\"_blank\">clarity</a>,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>There is no thornier mess of issues facing the Trudeau government than its relations with Indigenous populations. Faced with mixed results at best, the Prime Minister has decided to up his game. Philpott is just about his most formidable player. To say the least, success isn&#8217;t guaranteed, but her new assignment is the biggest news of a surprisingly big shuffle.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/playing-the-jane-philpott-card-trudeau-shuffles-the-deck/\">Playing the Jane Philpott card: Trudeau shuffles the deck</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/playing-the-jane-philpott-card-trudeau-shuffles-the-deck/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>8</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Chrystia Freeland plays her NAFTA hand</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/chrystia-freeland-plays-her-nafta-hand/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/chrystia-freeland-plays-her-nafta-hand/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 14 Aug 2017 19:28:24 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul Wells]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Facebook Instant Articles]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Ottawa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Chrystia Freehand]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[NAFTA]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Simon Reisman]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.macleans.ca/?p=1052521</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Paul Wells on how the minister unveiled her NAFTA wish list with some Trumpian language and the vagueness of a career communicator</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/chrystia-freeland-plays-her-nafta-hand/\">Chrystia Freeland plays her NAFTA hand</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=\"attachment_1052581\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/AUG14_WELLS_FREELAND_POST.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1052581\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1052581\" src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/AUG14_WELLS_FREELAND_POST.jpg\" alt=\"Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland discusses modernizing NAFTA at public forum at the University of Ottawa in Ottawa on Monday, Aug. 14, 2017.

(Sean Kilpatrick/CP)</p></div>\n<p>\u201cWhen\u00a0I\u00a0use a word,\u201d Lewis Carroll\u2019s Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, \u201cIt means just what I choose it to mean\u2014neither more nor less.\u201d Chrystia Freeland has similar goals when she\u00a0talks. By the time she met reporters in the House of Commons foyer on Monday the foreign minister was speaking about NAFTA for the third time in half a day. She knew what she wanted to say, and she would say neither more nor less.</p>\n<p>The Americans want to re-open the trade deal\u2019s dispute-settlement mechanism, one reporter said. \u201cIs it a line in the sand?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI spoke in my remarks today, both at committee\u201d\u2014that\u2019s the Commons committee on trade, whose unusual mid-summer meeting she\u2019d just left\u2014\u201cand at the University of Ottawa, about the importance for Canada in having mechanisms to ensure that any anti-dumping and countervailing duties are levied only when appropriate and are fair,\u201d Freeland said. \u201cThat has been a historic objective of Canada\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cI spoke about the great work of the late, great Simon Reisman in securing such a mechanism, and Canada absolutely stands very firm in the importance of having such a mechanism.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/nafta-emerges-as-trudeaus-biggest-unexpected-test/\">NAFTA emerges as Trudeau\u2019s biggest, unexpected test</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>This was not <em>quite</em> the same as not answering the question at all. Lines in\u00a0sand had vanished, buried under a billowing dune of the minister\u2019s own lines. But a sense of dispute settlement\u2019s rank in Freeland\u2019s hierarchy of priorities remained, dimply glimpsed behind the verbiage: Keeping an impartial mechanism for settling disputes was a \u201chistoric objective\u201d that had provoked Simon Reisman to walk out of an early generation\u2019s trade talks. Canada \u201cabsolutely stands very firm\u201d on all this.</p>\n<p>Was she saying she\u2019ll have negotiators walk out of NAFTA talks over the same issue? Reuters had <a href=\"http://ca.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKCN1AU1CK-OCABS\" target=\"_blank\">already decided</a>, on the strength of her remarks at the University of Ottawa earlier in the day, that she was saying precisely that. \u00a0<em>[UPDATE: Reuters&#8217; excellent reporter David Ljunggren says I read too much certainty into a more carefully nuanced article, and he&#8217;s got a point. -pw]</em> But nobody can quote any sentence in which she made such a threat, because she was careful to pronounce no such sentence.</p>\n<p>Sure, she was at pains to honour the ghost of Reisman, whose threat to let free-trade talks in the 1980s collapse was the key, in trade mythology, to getting the deal Canada wanted. She reminded everyone that as recently as last year she had staged her own walk-out at trade talks with the European Union. There will be &#8220;moments of drama,&#8221; she said. Nobody should expect Canada to be a pushover. &#8220;It is no accident that hockey is our national sport.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But did she connect the dots among those hints? Nope! Would she connect them when invited to do so by reporters? Nope!</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wooing-america/\">How Canada hopes to one-up the White House on NAFTA</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>It was that kind of morning. She defended supply management in Canadian agriculture at every turn. When a reporter asked whether Canada would consent to a modest increase in\u00a0U.S. market access, along the lines of concessions Canada made in trade negotiations with the European Union, she repeated\u00a0the same generic defence of supply management. The question, in an important way, hadn&#8217;t been about that. When reporters tried to get her to reply more directly to the question, she stuck just as hard as she could to the original not-quite-apposite answer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Okay, let me just\u2014hang on, hang on,&#8221; she said over objections. &#8220;Let me just say that in English.&#8221; (Her first not-quite-an-answer had been in French.) &#8220;Guys, guys, guys. Okay, I\u2019m going to answer in English. Thank you.&#8221; And then she played back her original not-quite-an-answer, in the other official language, taking care to come no closer to answering the question.</p>\n<p>You can always tell when a career communicator is making a point of not being too clear.</p>\n<p>None of this should come as too much of a surprise. On Wednesday in Washington, negotiations to renew NAFTA will begin. Donald Trump&#8217;s vague threat to abrogate the treaty if he doesn&#8217;t like the way negotiations are going will hang over the proceedings like a stinky cloud. The American demands are known. The Trudeau government hadn&#8217;t said much in response. Now Freeland was saying more\u2014but only as much more as she wanted to say.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE: <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/chrystia-freelands-vision-for-a-new-nafta/\">Chrystia Freeland\u2019s vision for a new NAFTA</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>What does Canada want? First, &#8220;to modernize NAFTA,&#8221; the minister said. Second, to make it &#8220;more progressive.&#8221; That&#8217;s super-vague, but she offered a little more specificity. Labour safeguards and environmental provisions need to be brought into the agreement, as should &#8220;a new chapter on gender rights,&#8221; &#8220;an Indigenous chapter&#8221; and changes to the investor-state dispute settlement process.</p>\n<p>Now, at first blush this sounds like a long list of things Trump will never agree to. But Trump\u2014whose very name was spectacularly absent from\u00a0the text of Freeland&#8217;s prepared remarks at\u00a0the University of Ottawa, giving this whole high-stakes trade round some of the aura of a virgin birth\u2014is an odd duck. Depending on the day, for all anyone knows, it may be possible to get him to agree that the moon is made of cream cheese.</p>\n<p>Freeland used Trumpian language to burnish the appeal of part of her wish list. The environment and labour stuff\u00a0&#8220;are how we guarantee that the modernized NAFTA will not only be an exemplary free trade deal, it will also be a fair trade deal,&#8221; she said. Canadians&#8217; commitment to free trade &#8220;wavers&#8230; when trade agreements put our workers at an unfair disadvantage because of the high standards that we rightly demand.&#8221; Was it too much of a stretch to imagine Trump watching a clip of those remarks on <em>Fox and Friends</em> and tweeting out his support for Freeland&#8217;s argument? OK, it&#8217;s a stretch, but is it <em>too much</em> of a stretch?</p>\n<p>Some other elements on Freeland&#8217;s list\u2014red tape reduction, procurement, services\u2014will ensure that business Republicans, and the business Liberals at the Business Council of Canada, can muster some enthusiasm for the process.</p>\n<p>Will the Trump trade team buy it all? Almost certainly not. Will they buy some of it? Probably, and I&#8217;d wager more than you might expect. Will Trump accept it as a win? Freeland pronounced herself &#8220;deeply optimistic,&#8221; and it didn&#8217;t sound like mere bluster. The president has made it clear he wants victories and is unimpressed by fine print when he is even aware there is any. He seems a prime sucker for a con. The minister would want me to emphasize that that&#8217;s my language, not hers.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"bc-video bc-video-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"player-loader\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n\t\t\t<iframe src=\"http://www.macleans.ca/video/iframe/13639244001/VJjIBwmqg/5543970301001\"\n\t\t\t\twidth=\"640\"\n\t\t\t\theight=\"360\"\n\t\t\t\tallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tmozallowfullscreen\n\t\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; right: 0px; left: 0px;\" class=\"rdm-brightcove-videojs-iframe\"></iframe>\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/chrystia-freeland-plays-her-nafta-hand/\">Chrystia Freeland plays her NAFTA hand</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.macleans.ca\">Macleans.ca</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/chrystia-freeland-plays-her-nafta-hand/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>11</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>",
