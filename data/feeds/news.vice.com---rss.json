Falkowski ending up saving the lives of 19 of her students by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/15/us/teacher-hid-students-florida-shooting-trnd/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">barricading inside her classroom closet</a>.</p> <p>In the 19 years since two teenagers gunned down 13 people in a Columbine, Colorado, high school, more and more schools have sought to train kids for the possibility of a shooter one day walking into their building. The federal government has even issued national guidance on how to handle a school shooter, instructing officials to teach kids some variation of \u00e2\u0080\u009cRun, Hide, Fight\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which instructs people caught in an active-shooter situation to try to get away from a gunman and, if necessary, confront him.</p> <p> <b> <i><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/59w9y5/the-army-is-using-video-game-technology-to-simulate-school-shootings\" target=\"_blank\">READ: The Army is using videogame technology to simulate school shootings </a></i> </b> </p> <p>But even as the frequency of school shootings skyrockets, far too many schools still remain unprepared, experts say, and disagreements still linger over whether to teach kids to fight back.</p> <p>A March 2016 <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/680/675737.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Government Accountability Office survey</a> found that out of 51 state educational agencies, 40 require individual schools to conduct exercises, like drills, to prepare students for emergencies. But only 12 states explicitly require that schools run exercises that prepare students for active shooter situations.</p> <p>\u00e2\u0080\u009cMore than half of [schools] are not adequately prepared,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said John Curnutt, assistant director of the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training (ALERRT) Center at Texas State University, which uses federal grants to train people about how to handle active shooter situations and is recommended by the FBI. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey definitely have an emergency plan in a big three-ring binder somewhere on the campus\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But as a culture in the school, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very few of them that are really ready.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p> <p> <b> <i><a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/3k7vej/all-the-times-nikolas-cruz-was-reported-to-authorities-before-the-florida-shooting\" target=\"_blank\">READ: All the times Nikolas Cruz was reported to authorities before the shooting</a> </i> </b> </p> <p>Experts say that kids need more than the occasional drill on how to evacuate a school or lock down a classroom. (In a school lockdown, teachers and students typically hole up in their classrooms in silence, with the lights off.) Instead, they say schools need to hold frequent, frank training and conversations.</p> <p>\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow often do you practice this type of situation? How often do schools take the time to have drills on safety procedures?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Mac Hardy, director of operations for National Association of School Resource Officers, which oversees sown law enforcement officers who work in schools. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe conversation should be consistent with staff and personnel\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I mean, monthly, at teacher workshops, [at] teacher meetings \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because they have those once a week \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and these conversations should be as short as 10 minutes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p> <p>An estimated 67 percent of schools held at least one exercise to teach kids how to handle an active shooter between 2012 and 2015, according to the Government Accountability Office report. And if that number sounds high, it pales in comparison to the 97 percent of schools that held at least one fire drill \u00e2\u0080\u0094 despite the fact that fatalities due to fires are much less common. While <a href=\"https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/statistics/v14i14.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">five people</a> died in school fires between 2011 and 2013, that same time period saw 166 people die in school shootings, according to a FBI and Justice Department report.</p> <p>The office surveyed school officials about this disparity, and found that some worried running active shooter exercises could cause anxiety, including among parents. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOfficials from one of these districts noted the difficulty of striking a balance between providing knowledge and inciting fear, particularly at schools with younger children,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the report found.</p> <p>\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere [are] people that choose to be in denial, that they will play the odds,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Curnutt said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey will not take any special precautions, or take any extra effort, because that [takes] time and money and most school districts are already strapped for time and money and their staff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention span.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p> <p>Schools may also disagree about what to actually tell children to do in active shooter situations. Jeff Zisner, who trains schools on how to handle such scenarios as president of AEGIS Securities & Investigations, says most experts offer the same advice: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you can create distance and barriers between you and the bad guy, do it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, lockdown shelter in place, inform law enforcement, and prepare to fight back if you have to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p> <p> <i> <b>READ: <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/d3wdzz/snapchat-instagram-twitter-showed-horror-of-stoneman-douglas-mass-shooting-in-parkland-florida\" target=\"_blank\">How Florida students changed the way we experience school shootings</a></b> </i> </p> <p>Zisner acknowledges that these instructions can become \u00e2\u0080\u009cexponentially more difficult\u00e2\u0080\u009d to follow when dealing with children, but stresses that if high school students are willing and able to fight, teachers shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily stop them. </p> <p>\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese are real circumstances with real ramifications, and your job is to do the best you can given your experience and knowledge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he explained.</p> <p>But federal agencies still appear to differ in their interpretation of \u00e2\u0080\u009cRun, Hide, Fight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A 2013 guide issued by the Department of Justice, FBI, Department of Homeland Security, FEMA, and the Department of Health and Human suggests that adults consider confronting a shooter as a last resort. These agencies purposefully refrained from directing children to fight, a Department of Education official told VICE News.</p> <p>In contrast, the FBI does not officially take a position on children fighting, according to the Government Accountability Office report, and believes the guide was designed to \u00e2\u0080\u009callow each community to determine whether to discuss with high school students the option of fighting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d </p> <p>These differences may seem miniscule. However, in a terrifying, overwhelming situation where people may only have minutes to make a choice, they could mean the difference between life and death. The lack of clarity may also decrease the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall preparedness.</p> <p>\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot all relevant agencies and officials are included in collaborative efforts or are aware of related efforts and resources,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the report notes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand agencies are offering different interpretations of the same federal guidance \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all of which risks wasting limited federal resources on duplicative, overlapping, or fragmented efforts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p> <p>Ultimately, Falkowski believes no amount of preparation could have saved the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School from the carnage.</p> <p>\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd even still, even with that, we still have 17 casualties, 17 people that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to return to their families. And to me, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s totally unacceptable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Falkowski, as she choked back tears on national television. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom my personal viewpoint, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time for Congress, government, somebody, to do something. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to talk about what the problem is, and try to fix it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p> <p> <i> <b>Cover image:</b> \"Victims\" are led out as members of the Fountain Police Department take part in an Active Shooter Response Training exercise at Fountain Middle School on June 9, 2017, in Fountain, Colorado.

He ignored questions about Russia and affairs with women,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to the White House press pool report.</p> <p> Reporters were asking specifically about a New Yorker report from Friday morning that <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/59kyka/trump-karen-mcdougal-affair-playboy-new-yorker\" target=\"_blank\">details an affair between Trump and a Playboy model named Karen McDougal</a> that began in 2006 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the same time Trump was also reportedly courting the porn actress known as Stormy Daniels. Both women have noted in their accounts that Melania had recently given birth to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s youngest son, Barron, now 11. </p> <p> (Trump denied the allegations, saying through a spokesperson, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is an old story that is just more fake news...The president says he never had a relationship with McDougal,\" but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karenmcdougal98/status/644508193196904448\" target=\"_blank\">photographs posted in 2015 show the pair were together</a> at at least two of the events detailed in her story.)</p> <p> The New Yorker report also details an encounter between Trump and McDougal at his residence in Trump Tower in New York, where McDougal says Trump specifically pointed out Melania\u00e2\u0080\u0099s separate bedroom, saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe liked her space to read or be alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p> <p> Melania certainly appeared to want her space or be alone on Friday afternoon, when she departed the White House in a private car without her husband. </p> <p> \"With her schedule, it was easier to meet him on the plane,\" Melania\u00e2\u0080\u0099s communications director, Stephanie Grisham, explained in a statement obtained by CNN.</p> <p> It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the first time the first lady has traveled separately from her husband in the wake of a damning news report \u00e2\u0080\u0094 she also took a separate car to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s State of the Union address on Jan. 30, in her first public appearance following <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-lawyer-arranged-130-000-payment-for-adult-film-stars-silence-1515787678\" target=\"_blank\">a Jan. 13 Wall Street Journal report</a> that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s camp had paid Daniels $130,000 a few weeks before the election, to keep quiet. And in the days after the report was published, Melania cancelled a planned trip to Switzerland with her husband and spent the weekend alone at Mar-a-Lago instead. </p> <p> Grisham cited \"scheduling and logistical issues\" that prevented Melania from accompanying her husband on the trip.</p> <p> If true, it would just be one of many strange coincidences suggesting tension between the couple \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including <a href=\"https://theslot.jezebel.com/melania-trump-wore-an-1-100-gucci-pussy-bow-shirt-to-t-1787604900\" target=\"_blank\">Melania\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choice to wear a bright-pink \u00e2\u0080\u009cpussy bow\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gucci blouse</a> to a debate days after the infamous video of Trump talking about grabbing women \u00e2\u0080\u009cby the pussy\u00e2\u0080\u009d was leaked.

Joining the operation in the fall of 2013, Burchik played a pivotal role managing the personnel and planning, according to the indictment. </p> <h2> Aleksandra Yuryevna Krylova</h2> <p>Third in command at Prigozhin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incredibly well-funded troll factory, Krylova traveled to the U.S. in 2014 under false pretenses to collect information for the then budding operation, according to the indictment. </p> <h2> Anna Vladislavovna Bogacheva</h2> <p>Unlike the defendants outlined above, Bogacheva appears to be less of a manager and more of a data geek. She worked on the operations translations and oversaw data analysis, according to the indictment. </p> <p>Like Krylova, investigators say she traveled to the U.S. under false pretenses on a fact-finding mission. </p> <h2> Sergey Pavlovich Polozov</h2> <p>If this were a James Bond movie, Polozov would probably be the computer wiz. According to the indictment, Polozov worked as the team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IT expert, getting hold of U.S. servers and equipment designed to disguise their true locations back in Russia. </p> <h2> Maria Anatolyevna Bovda </h2> <p>Maria Boyda lasted a year with the Internet Research Agency, arriving around November 2013 and leaving in October 2014, according to Mueller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s findings. She headed up the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctranslator project\u00e2\u0080\u009d and held several other positions, according to the indictment. It is not mentioned whether Maria Boyda and Robert Boyda are related. </p> <h2> Robert Sergeyevich Bovda </h2> <p>Robert Sergeyevich Bovda also allegedly worked for the Internet Research Agency for about a year, the exact same dates as Maria Boyda is alleged to have been employed. He worked as the deputy head of the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctranslator project,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which by July 2016 included more than eighty employees who were monitoring, posting, and updating content for a U.S. audience, according to the indictment.</p> <p>In 2014, Boyda and several others, including Kyrlova and Bogacheva allegedly attempted to enter the U.S. \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor personal reasons,\u00e2\u0080\u009d hoping to hide the fact that they all worked for the Internet Research Agency. While Kyrlova and Bogacheva both managed to squeeze through and tour eight different states (and Mexico), Boyda couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t obtain a visa and never entered, according to the indictment. </p> <h2> Dzheykhun Nasimi Ogly Aslanov</h2> <p>At first glance, Dzheykhun Nasimi Ogly Aslanov, allegedly had significant and overarching role as head of the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctranslator project,\u00e2\u0080\u009d taking on the same position that Maria Boyda had prior.</p> <p>But Aslanov also had direct financial ties to Prigozhin, according to the indictment. Aslanov was the general director of Azimut LLC, one of the entities allegedly used to transfer money between Concord and the Internet Research Agency. Mueller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s indictment singles out Aslanov along with the IRA and one other defendant, with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud.</p> <h2> The Social Media Operators: Vadim Vladimirovich Podkopaev, Gleb Igorevitch Vasilchenko, Irina Viktorovna Kaverzina, and Vladimir Venko</h2> <p>Little is known about the personal lives of the last four named defendants \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Vadim Vladimirovich Podkopaev, Gleb Igorevitch Vasilchenko, Irina Viktorovna Kaverzina and Vladimir Venkov. But professionally, they all held a similar role, central to the Internet Research Agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission \u00e2\u0080\u0094 monitoring, updating, and posting on social media, according to the indictment. Podkopaev and Vasilchenko both allegedly joined the Internet Research Agency in 2014 and drafted content for social media platforms. Vasilchenko would also allegedly impersonate Americans or U.S. grassroots organizations.</p> <p>Kaverzina and Venkov allegedly acted as translators on social media, while simultaneously manning \u00e2\u0080\u009cmultiple U.S. personas\u00e2\u0080\u009d online. Kaverzina, for her part, was caught trying to destroy evidence, once writing an email to a family member, which read, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe had a slight crisis here at work: the FBI busted our activity (not a joke.)\u00e2\u0080\u009d In that email she admitted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI created all these pictures and posts, and the Americans believed that it was written by their people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p> <p>The special counsel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office additionally charged them and the Internet Research Agency with aggravated identity theft. </p> <p>While perhaps they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re considered more shadowy figures, social media became the IRA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most-used weapon to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The organization allegedly had \u00e2\u0080\u009cspecialists\u00e2\u0080\u009d who operated on day shifts and night shifts to cover time zone differences. It impersonated social activists and political groups, and spent \u00e2\u0080\u009cthousands\u00e2\u0080\u009d of dollars every month buying up advertisements to promote Internet Research Agency-controlled social media accounts, according to the indictment. </p><p><i><b>Cover image:</b> Concord Catering General Director Yevgeny Prigozhin seen after the sixth meeting of the High-Level Russian-Turkish Cooperation Council.
