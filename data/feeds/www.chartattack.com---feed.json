Running from August 4th \u2013 6th the festival features performances from a plethora of talented artists from the area and all over Canada. Whether you want to check out the Muskoka music scene or experience the Jim Cuddy Family Band perform at the historic Opera House the festival offers a jam-packed weekend of activities for music lovers.</p>\n<p>Sawdust City Music Festival is the brain child of musician, singer, actress and label owner Miranda Mulholland (who will be performing in the festival as one half of the duo Harrow Fair). Her Great-Great Grandfather was Charles Mickle, who owned the big logging company that made Gravenhurst \u201cSawdust City\u201d - hence the name of the festival. We caught up with the always enigmatic Miranda who spoke about her vision for the festival and her roots in Gravenhurst. Plus, she gave us her list of \u201cmust dos\u201d for a weekend in Gravenhurst.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MZa86RUNa9s?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Check out the full line up and schedule over at <a href=\"https://www.sawdustcitymusicfestival.com/\">https://www.sawdustcitymusicfestival.com/</a></p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/chart-tv/2017/07/27/sawdust-city-music-festival/\">Sawdust City Music Festival</a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/author/admin/\">Chart Attack</a> | <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com\">Chart Attack</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.chartattack.com/chart-tv/2017/07/27/sawdust-city-music-festival/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Interview: Danko Jones</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.chartattack.com/news/2017/07/21/interview-danko-jones/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.chartattack.com/news/2017/07/21/interview-danko-jones/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2017 21:23:53 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Chart Attack]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[NEW(S)]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Danko Jones]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.chartattack.com/?p=184587</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>We sat down with John Calabrese, bassist of Danko Jones to talk about the band's impressive 20+ year career, most memorable moments and their newest album Wild Cat.\u00a0</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/news/2017/07/21/interview-danko-jones/\">Interview: Danko Jones</a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/author/admin/\">Chart Attack</a> | <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com\">Chart Attack</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Danko Jones have been on the Hard Rock scene for over 20 years. \u00a0This year they released their 8th studio album entitled Wild Cat, with hard hitting, in your face rock anthems.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w2UBO1ahKlg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>We sat down with bassist\u00a0John 'JC' Calabrese to talk about the new album, the band's accomplishments and what's next for Danko Jones.</p>\n<p><strong>What are some of the major changes in the industry that have changed how you market the band?</strong></p>\n<p>When we started off in the industry the internet was just taking off and I remember being one of the first bands in Toronto who had a website. \u00a0So we've kind of seen that whole shift towards more tangible online music... that's immediate. \u00a0When we started our website we didn't put any music on there but now with YouTube you are able to see a full concert. I feel like the industry has done a poor job of catching up with the medium. For example during the days of Napster, the music industry would\u00a0keep trying to re-issue cds to compete and now there are platforms like Spotify. Spotify is big in Canada now but\u00a0in Europe its a marker for booking bands. They look to see how many Spotify listeners you have.</p>\n<p>What hasn't changed is the fact that at the end of the day you still have to be a good band. If you're terrible live and you can't hit the same notes that are in your recording everyone's going to know.</p>\n<p><strong>What was different in recording Wild Cat versus past albums?</strong></p>\n<p>Wild Cat is the first time we used the\u00a0same personnel, being the same guys in the band, same studio and same producer. We went in with Eric Ratz who we were able to rekindle a working relationship with, that started years ago. We recorded the drums at Revolution Studios in Toronto and then to Vespa for mixing. So there is a bit of\u00a0consistency, finally after 21 years -in the recording process. It was the first time we didn't have to think about going to\u00a0a new studio and it helped not having to worry about that. When we worked with Eric on Fire Music we found that the recording process was fun, we weren't slaving away trying to make something. We were just going into the studio to enjoy ourselves and create something that we all like, so we did that again on Wild Cat and it shows as you can feel the energy... there's no staleness there. It was also great to be back in Toronto, which is our hometown.</p>\n<p><strong>What were your major influences on Wild Cat?</strong></p>\n<p>You get what you get with the band. It\u2019s a rock record, for this record we went with some songs where we wear our influences on our sleeves. \u201cYou Are My Woman\u201d has a Thin Lizzy vibe, then with Wild Cat there is a Van Halen kind of sound to it and there are some Misfits and Motorhead influences on the album as well.\u00a0So far the\u00a0response has been really good especially in Germany, Sweden and the Scandinavian countries.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2L0g5vnzpcVkvo0WjCpNHB\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><br />\n<iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0dP19U4gAPDbLbEiZkUmuQ\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p><b>A lot of your touring time is spent in Europe, why is that?</b></p>\n<p>The band tends to have a big presence in Europe, we first went there because the continent was big and it was easier to get from country to country versus playing in Canada where the drive alone from Toronto to Thunder Bay is 15 hours. Europe welcomed us and was the first place that a label signed us. It's funny because people in Canada kept telling us that we would never do well in Europe and we went there partly out of stubbornness and also because we believed\u00a0in what we were doing. And it's paid off, we've now been able to tour along side bands that we looked up to.</p>\n<p>They also have a bigger outdoor music festival scene. And the festivals are prone to accepting a variety of music and can feature a band like Scream [American Punk band] and also Kreator [German Thrash Metal]. Where as here you have the heavy music festival and the indie music festival and every band is slotted into the type of genre that they play. I prefer the festival setup in Europe I can go listen to Drum and Bass and then go watch Metal bands. \u00a0One festival I went and watched Lykki Li and then Slayer on the next stage. And its all great music.</p>\n<p><strong>Has your live show changed at all?</strong></p>\n<p>We're just playing a lot of new songs.\u00a0There\u2019s no gimmicks, it\u2019s just Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll. There are no inflatable dolls or pyro (laughs), we're not that kind of a band we just feed off of the audience that shows up.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qiOQKKylbLQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Favourite Toronto concert experience (your own and one you have attended)?</strong></p>\n<p>Favourite Toronto concert was watching the <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/tag/beastie_boys/\">Beastie Boys</a> at the Varsity during the Check Your Head tour. It was crazy, when they came on stage the whole crowd was just jumping up and down. <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/tag/henry_rollins/\">The Henry Rollins Band</a> actually opened for them and he was incredible.</p>\n<p>One of my favourite memories of our shows in Toronto was opening for <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/news/2002/08/19/live-rolling-stones-in-toronto/\">The Rolling Stones at the Palais Royale</a>. It was a memorable concert to be a part of. [<a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/news/2002/08/19/danko-jones-behind-the-scenes-at-stones-show/\">Check out an interview on Chart with Danko Jones just after that show</a>]</p>\n<p><strong>What's up next for the band and what are some milestones you want to hit?</strong></p>\n<p>The rest of the summer we are on the festival run in Europe. In October we\u00a0may be back in Canada for a few shows, before going back to Europe in November and December. But career wise we just want to win a Juno, a Grammy and do an East Coast Canada tour (laughs). Rich [drummer] is from the East Coast, Prince Edward Island to be exact, so we definitely want to do some shows out there. If anyone wants to book us... hint hint (laughs).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/news/2017/07/21/interview-danko-jones/\">Interview: Danko Jones</a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/author/admin/\">Chart Attack</a> | <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com\">Chart Attack</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.chartattack.com/news/2017/07/21/interview-danko-jones/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Interview: Kid Koala</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.chartattack.com/news/2017/07/20/interview-kid-koala/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.chartattack.com/news/2017/07/20/interview-kid-koala/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2017 13:54:22 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Chart Attack]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[NEW(S)]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Kid Koala]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.chartattack.com/?p=184563</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Kid Koala chats with us about his chaotic party show Vinyl Vaudeville, his new album Music To Draw To: Satellite and working on .</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/news/2017/07/20/interview-kid-koala/\">Interview: Kid Koala</a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/author/admin/\">Chart Attack</a> | <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com\">Chart Attack</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We caught Kid Koala's insane party show at \u00a0Festival d'\u00e9t\u00e9\u00a0de Qu\u00e9bec this past Saturday. \u00a0Not only did he wear his infamous Koala suit he attempted to create a human vinyl by getting the crowd to participate in a massive circular conga line. \u00a0The show enticed smiles across Imp\u00e9rial Bell as audience members played kazoos, flew paper planes over each other's heads and watched puppets shaped as laptops dance across the stage... yeah it was weird...but a hell of a good time!</p>\n<p>We chatted with Kid Koala before the show to talk about his newest release Music To Draw To: Satellite, his work on Baby Driver, the Vinyl Vaudeville tour and the other multiple projects he has on the go.</p>\n<p><b>What makes you go from the mind space of something like Twelve Bit Blues to Music To Draw To?</b></p>\n<p>It is actually completely a weather thing. It has more to do with the change from Summer, to Autumn to Winter than it does, thinking in terms of musical style. When you live in Montreal there is that Jekyll and Hyde type of living situation when you are dealing with the weather. Just the most basic human level of going from 30 or 35 degrees to minus 35 degrees. It affects the type of music you wanna listen to, it affects the type of music you wanna make. I think the only time it gets a little method is when I have to make\u00a0melancholy Winter-y music in the Summers specifically for a film or something. Or if its Winter time and I get asked to do beats for what\u2019s coming out this Summer. I just kind of go by inspiration and I can\u2019t help but be affected by the temperatures. If I lived somewhere that is warm all the time or if I lived somewhere that was raining all the time my music would change absolutely.</p>\n<p><strong>You are on the soundtrack for Baby Driver; how is your process different for scoring a film versus working on your own albums?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, what\u2019s great about doing something for a film is the point is to just create music that supports that scene the best you can. I love working with film directors because they have such a concise vision of the story they are telling. You\u2019ll meet up with them and they\u2019ll explain to you what they want in the scene or story beat they wanna hit or what emotional beat they wanna hit and then your job at that point is\u00a0to try to create something that will help make that scene stronger, funnier, sadder or more exciting. \u00a0I\u2019ve always loved the cinema, and it combines many of my favorite things including music, storytelling and visuals. Its second nature, even though I haven\u2019t done that much score work, but whenever I speak to a director about doing something or they call me in to do a few scenes with music, they\u2019re speaking a language I can understand.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3igDZrG3DTQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Have you felt like your music may be going in a different direction than the director?</strong></p>\n<p>Uhm, not really. I pretty much just wanna support their vision.\u00a0If they\u2019re asking me to do something it\u2019s usually because there\u2019s some aesthetic that I can add, something that they know me for.\u00a0I might throw some options or demos at them, so they can listen and get a gauge\u00a0for what they\u2019re looking for exactly.</p>\n<p>I remember working with Jason Rietman [on Men Women and Children] and when he showed me a scene I felt like: \u201coh, ok\u2026 I\u2019ll try that, but then I have a little bit of an idea of how it could also work in terms of a different tone of music\u201d, and I sent him that and he was surprised because it was actually similar to stuff on Music To Draw To. He said: \u201cWho made this music?\u201d and I said \u201cI made this music\u201d and then he says\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t know you made this kind of music\u201d and I was like \u00a0\u201cyeah, I do, in the winter\u201d(laughs).</p>\n<p>So I sent him a few bits and he called me back and says: \u201cHey, we\u2019ve actually used a couple of these tracks in the soundtrack\u201d. There\u2019s a song called 'Nightfall', on Music to Draw To which has two versions and one features Emiliana Torrini, that\u2019s the song that Jason used in his credit sequence and also during the third act. He used the instrumental version in the third act but\u00a0he felt strongly enough about it that he said \u201cHey, we cut together this pivotal scene to that track and, you know, we wanted to do it again in the credit roll and this time can we hear it with some vocals?\u201d and so, he was actually the catalyst to me reaching out to Emiliana Torrini, I\u2019ve known her work for a while and we never had a chance to work together.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5Gg6Fw9nuPZF84y3mUGaqI\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>You\u2019ve worked with so many different people, what do you look for when you\u2019re working with someone and how does that relationship begin?</strong></p>\n<p>I think the first thing is just some sort of chemistry, or some sort of mutual interest to create something together. I\u2019ve been pretty lucky in that everybody who\u2019s approached me to work with them in the film world are Edgar Wright, Rian Johnson, Baz Luhrman and Jason [Reitman] and I\u2019m a fan of all of their films. It was just an honor to be asked, and I think when you\u2019re already a fan of somebody\u2019s work it\u2019s almost like you have a little bit of intuition into what they are trying to get. Oddly I met all of those directors at shows. They\u2019ve come to attend live shows of mine and we would meet afterwards and just hit it off.</p>\n<p><strong>Does it work the same when you are working with different musicians?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, absolutely I think when you meet someone or you\u2019re fan of somebody and you meet them in person and you hit it off usually it\u2019s a good sign that together you\u2019ll be able to make something, pretty cool.\u00a0You could buy all the technology and all the equipment in the world but really its people and their ideas and the chemistry that makes it palpable.</p>\n<p><strong>How did Vinyl Vaudeville come about and working with Adira Amram?</strong></p>\n<p>Vaudeville started as a concept when Twelve Bit Blues had first been released. It was kind of a pet project to create a live show where I can perform some of those songs which are quite slow and in a 6/8 time signature and not your standard 'hip hop or dance floor music. Its much slower and blues-ier and how do we do that without just making up-tempo dance versions of all the songs? Or how do we create the music, keep it intact with the way it was made and the way the tempo was made and still have a show that engages people and is fun and surprising?</p>\n<p>When I met up with Adira Amram, herself and three dancers had come to do an opening warm up set for me when I was down in New York and I just loved their act. They warmed the crowd up from zero to a hundred in less than the time it took to get to the first chorus of one of their songs. Immediately I knew that they\u2019re spectacular entertainers in their own right. I brought them on tour with <a href=\"https://kidkoala.bandcamp.com/album/the-slew-100\">The Slew</a> and while we were on the tour bus we were scheming up the idea of Vinyl Vaudville. The first version of Vaudville was 2012 or 2013 and we just loved working together.</p>\n<p>The idea was that every song would be a different act like a vaudevillian show. So there would be costume changes, there would be choreography, there would be different places to focus in terms of how the show dynamic went. And the tag line said, 'the silliest show on earth' because we wanted to give ourselves that freedom to take it wherever we wanted and try to cause some smiles to happen as far as audience reaction.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-184566\" src=\"http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_6438-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6438\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_6438-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_6438-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_6438-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>We added a bunch of acts and new music and I\u2019m really happy to be working with this crew and to be on tour with them this summer. This is the perfect summer tour.</p>\n<p>Either way I think the idea of having an audience comfortable enough to enjoy themselves is still key. Whether i\u2019m doing a show where it's a soft seat theatre and everyone is sitting down or where VAUDVILLE for instance it's standing room and it's a total chaos, party, kind of mob, it's still the same philosophy behind it. We want people to have a good time. The music can change, as you know, from album to album or season to season. We want the show always to \u00a0be a fun contextual experience.</p>\n<p><strong>What got you into DJ-ing?</strong></p>\n<p>The philosophy or ethos of scratch DJ-ing drew me to the instrument in the first place. Its always about trying to push something further and creating your own style to fit your personality. Back in the day, if you were in a DJ battle and it was your turn to go up, and you had 5 minutes to go up and the idea was you had to create something with your 5 minutes that people hadn\u2019t heard or seen or experienced yet and you had to do it with your own style and your own flare - that was really what I loved about that scene; it encouraged you to do that, not just everybody get up and do the same thing or do the exact same thing you did last time, it was more about what's fresh, what else are you going to pull out \u2026of your hat.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-184567\" src=\"http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_6239-2-1024x697.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6239 (2)\" width=\"1024\" height=\"697\" srcset=\"http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_6239-2-300x204.jpg 300w, http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_6239-2-768x523.jpg 768w, http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_6239-2-1024x697.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Are your fans responsive to all of the types of music and performances in your repertoire?</strong></p>\n<p>I feel very blessed, to have some people who have sorta followed me since Carpal Tunnel Syndrome in terms of coming to shows and seeing how its developed from one kid and two two turn tables to whatever it is now.</p>\n<p>Over the course of several albums and several tours if you looked at it back when I was starting, and you said \u201dyou have a half hour to DJ\u201d it wasn\u2019t like I was going to play one type of music for 30 minutes or stay on one tempo but I could connect it elegantly enough that the audience went on a bit of an adventure.\u00a0Taking a step back and thinking of it more in tours, lets say you get to design 12 tours over your lifetime, are you going to do the same kind of show every time? For me, absolutely not. I think that's the core of the scratch DJ in me, it's like \u201cno.\u201d You gotta take everything you learned from all the previous ones and apply it to what you're working on now.</p>\n<p>But at the same time, audience members have told me themselves at shows \u201cI\u2019ve seen you nine times and it\u2019s so different every time but it\u2019s still very much in the [same] demented universe\u201d and I\u2019m just really thankful that, there are some crowds that have seen that. I can\u2019t think of too many bands that I\u2019ve seen nine times. I always tell them \u201cI need to give you some frequent flier card or something, you guys are on the permanent guest list from now on\u201d</p>\n<p>Who knows? Maybe I do like a country record someday, or DJ only in barbecue joints (laughs), or I do a record that\u2019s really good for running or something for the gym and maybe we\u2019ll just do like you know, spinning classes, who knows? Whatever it is, it\u2019ll all reveal itself when its time I guess, but for now we\u2019re just having fun.</p>\n<p><strong>What you thoughts are on the evolution of the DJ equipment?<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>I actually don\u2019t think that much about it (laughs). I think the music that\u2019s always moved me, be it electronic, acoustic, rock or vocal or whatever it is, it\u2019s always the human element that resonates the most. If you\u2019re given a piece of technology that\u2019s fine, but at what point can you tell it was a human that made that or the technology just spat it out. I think in terms of something that really moves you, people are always looking for that human connection. So, for scratch DJs, once new mixers started coming out every year it wasn\u2019t like you just wanted to take a backseat to technology, you always wanted to master that technology and try to figure out a way to express yourself through it.</p>\n<p>The exciting part about turntables, for me, is sometimes something slips off the grid and the groove kind of shakes and it\u2019s because of little human mistakes. It's kind of like not having a safety net. For example in\u00a0Vinyl Vaudeville, there are moments where it\u2019s me creating the beat in real time on a wireless drum machine and I might have to scale a barricade to get into the crowd while I\u2019m doing it and while that\u2019s happening I miss a beat or something. This show, like all of my shows could fall apart in like a second, and its about how quickly would you cover or not recover or get back into the groove from it. It\u2019s those moments of tension that actually make it exciting. Like tightrope walking.</p>\n<p><strong>What's next for you?</strong></p>\n<p>I\u2019m continuing Baby Driver promotional shows, also we have Vaudeville and we have Nufonia Must Fall, a live animated graphic novel with multiple cameras, creating a film live with mini inter-sets and puppets. It\u2019s all scored live by myself on a piano and a turntable and the Afiara String Quartet. It sounds very complex but that\u2019s more like a cinematic live event that we\u2019re doing and we\u2019ve been doing for a few years so we are continuing touring on that.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s_DhuuHt76M?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>I\u2019m working on a soundtrack for a video game called Floor Kids \u00a0and it\u2019s a b-boy/breakdance videogame, and so that\u2019s pretty much what I\u2019m focusing on this autumn and as we move into winter, I\u2019m going to start a new album.<br />\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/157983217\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/157983217\">Introducing Floor Kids!</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/floorkids\">JonJon</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Post by: Sabrina Spence</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/news/2017/07/20/interview-kid-koala/\">Interview: Kid Koala</a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/author/admin/\">Chart Attack</a> | <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com\">Chart Attack</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.chartattack.com/news/2017/07/20/interview-kid-koala/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The Lemon Bucket Orkestra</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.chartattack.com/chart-tv/2017/07/19/lemon-bucket-orkestra/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.chartattack.com/chart-tv/2017/07/19/lemon-bucket-orkestra/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2017 20:43:50 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Chart Attack]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[ASK A BAND]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[CHART TV]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Lemon Bucket Orkestra]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.chartattack.com/?p=184572</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>A Toronto music staple Lemon Bucket Orkestra had humble origins as buskers in Kensington Market, the band\u2019s ringleader Mark Marczyk spoke to the Chart Attack team about the evolution of LBO and their drive to keep performing live for (and with) their ever-growing audiences.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/chart-tv/2017/07/19/lemon-bucket-orkestra/\">The Lemon Bucket Orkestra</a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/author/admin/\">Chart Attack</a> | <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com\">Chart Attack</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Toronto music staple Lemon Bucket Orkestra had humble origins as buskers in Kensington Market, the band\u2019s ringleader Mark Marczyk spoke to the Chart Attack team about the evolution of LBO and their drive to keep performing live for (and with) their ever-growing audiences.</p>\n<p>Lemon Bucket Orkestra are known for their live shows which are full of theatrics, merriment and most importantly amazing music.

A lineup outside of L\u2019ANTI Bar and Spectacles reached down the street as fans waited in hopes to catch his brilliance on the turntables. Once inside, the cozy bar was packed from wall to wall with sweaty bodies, spellbound by every beat he played. The mix was vast stretching from 1950s soul to 90s metal and anything in between (including the Tetris theme song).\u00a0 The show was epic and any Beastie Boys song thrown in the mix would drive the crowd wild.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:500px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\">\n<div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\">\n<div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BWjy1_MF68b/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">Quebec City! @barlanti #festivaldetedequebec #mixmastermike #mixfam</a></p>\n<p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by MIX MASTER MIKE (@mixmastermike) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2017-07-15T07:44:37+00:00\">Jul 15, 2017 at 12:44am PDT</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script></p>\n<p>We caught up with Mix Master Mike before his show in Quebec City to talk about his tour with Metallica and his VR projects.</p>\n<p><strong>How is the tour going?</strong></p>\n<p>The tour has been going really well, the energy I get from the stadium tour is amazing. I\u2019ve also been playing smaller club shows after the Metallica shows in different cities which have been great.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you keep the energy up being on tour for so long?</strong></p>\n<p>It gets to be a lot; sometimes you forget what city you\u2019re in. But I have been doing this for two decades and I\u2019ve learned how to manage my time and how to stay healthy.</p>\n<p><strong>How did the tour with Metallica come about?</strong></p>\n<p>Metallica actually reached out to my management. Lars specifically actually talked to my management. I knew about the tour about 5 months before it started and I didn\u2019t tell anyone until the end of April just because I wanted to be sure it was real.</p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s it like playing to such a different audience? Metallica fans are very much metal fans and you have such a big background in hip hop.</strong></p>\n<p>I like to bridge the gap for Metallica fans. I want to show them something they didn\u2019t even know they needed. I do one power set right before Metallica comes on and its pretty amazing. I like to give them a kind of Metal assault brigade that I can end the show with and hype them up for the band. But I mix everything into my music I have Metal, I have soul and I have hip hop.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you prefer stadium shows over club shows?</strong></p>\n<p>I don\u2019t really have a preference they are really different. My favorite thing as an artist is to take people away emotionally; it\u2019s almost like therapy for me. Stadium shows tend to be harder to connect with people but that just means my performance has to be dialed in and I have to be able to transmit the energy to an ocean of people. In a live performance there is no room for error.\u00a0 DJ-ing is almost like performance art so you have to be in a zen space to be able to perform and to focus but in attack mode to create that energy.</p>\n<p><strong>What are your biggest influences when you\u2019re coming up with new music?</strong></p>\n<p>I like to draw inspiration from within myself and make something from nothing. My mind is almost like a library of ideas that I can tap into, and take nothing and turn it into something. I am very much a vibe person and I just absorb everything around me and file away for later.</p>\n<p><strong>How has your art changed since Hello Nasty?</strong></p>\n<p>I\u2019ve learned so much since Hello Nasty. Actually Adam Yacht has taught me a lot especially how to be a better business person. But I think over the years I\u2019ve learnt that no matter what we go through our ups and downs and either way you have to be true to yourself and to your art. You can\u2019t compromise your passion or your integrity.</p>\n<p><strong>What is some advice you have for artists today?</strong></p>\n<p>I think the biggest mistake of some artists today is they look for what\u2019s \u2018in\u2019 or what\u2019s popular rather than paving their own way.\u00a0 When the phase dies you lose. You should be doing this for your art and for your exploration.</p>\n<p><strong>Who did you grow up listening to?</strong></p>\n<p>I listened to a bit of everything. I had a Jimmy Hendrix VHS which I would watch all the time. Zeppelin live in concert, I remember watching the John Bonham solo over and over. Other people that were part of that foundation I had were Stevie Ray Vaughn, Neil Pert, Miles Davis. As I went on to create my own music I wanted to take all of that theory and knowledge and apply it to what I was doing.</p>\n<p><strong>What are you listening to now?</strong></p>\n<p>On the road I listen to the Delphonics, Isaac Hayes, Thelonious Monk. I like to listen to music that takes me away. Not that I don\u2019t listen to newer music too; like Kendrick Lamar, Run the Jewels, Future etc.,</p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s next for you?</strong></p>\n<p>I\u2019m working on a lot of different projects. I\u2019m really into this VR project that I just made entitled Magma Chamber.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yZOdelqXp2I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>I\u2019m trying to use the music and this medium to provoke thought. It's a different way for me to get people thinking. Magma Chamber was recently just featured at Cannes film festival and is getting a lot of recognition. So I'm excited to focus a little more on my VR work after the tour. We have plans for another one which will be like a 20 minute opus that will show what it would be like if there was an alien invasion on the moon.</p>\n<p>Mix Master Mike continues his <a href=\"https://www.mixmastermike.com/live\">tour </a>with Metallica and will be making his next stop in Montreal on Wednesday and then west coast dates in August.</p>\n<p>Post by: Sabrina Spence</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/features/2017/07/17/interview-mix-master-mike/\">Interview: Mix Master Mike</a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/author/admin/\">Chart Attack</a> | <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com\">Chart Attack</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.chartattack.com/features/2017/07/17/interview-mix-master-mike/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Interview: The Dirty Nil</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.chartattack.com/news/2017/07/14/184531/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.chartattack.com/news/2017/07/14/184531/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2017 17:53:26 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Chart Attack]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[NEW(S)]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Against Me!]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Festival D'Ete]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Sam Coffey & The Iron Lungs]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[The Dirty Nil]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[The Who]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.chartattack.com/?p=184531</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The Dirty Nil played one of their biggest shows in Canada yesterday.

Photo By: Vithiya Murugadas</h6>\n<p>We caught up with Kyle Fisher just before their show to talk about touring, Minimum R&amp;B and playing <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/tag/festival_dete/\">FEQ</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>How's the tour going?</strong><br />\nTouring has been a blast. We were really lucky with the last one, with <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/tag/the_flatliners/\">The Flatliners</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/tag/sam-coffey-the-iron-lungs/\">Sam Coffey and The Iron Lungs</a>. Both of those bands are full of awesome people and they play great music so we had a blast. I also like traveling and we are very lucky to experience the world this way.</p>\n<p><strong>How has the reception been in Europe?</strong><br />\nIt's growing there. I think the festivals will be fun. Every time we've gone there we've seen more and more people coming out to shows and we're doing a couple shows with <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/tag/against_me!/\">Against Me!</a>\u00a0this time. I'm really excited to play a couple shows with them before we go on tour with them in the Fall.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you guys miss the most when you are on tour?</strong><br />\nSometimes depending where we are, it's just knowing where to get coffee. In Germany there are a lot of places that have really great coffee. But sometimes all you find are those automated machines and you order a coffee and they just put a cup under a machine and push a button and then you're like \"aw fuck\" and then they're like \"4 euros\" and you're like \"ah shit\". So that kind of thing gets annoying after a while and I get nit picky. Friends and family of course and how laid back Canadians can be. Even going to the States and you find stuff that would never really happen in Canada, like the feeling or vibe that you get in certain areas and from certain people. It happens everywhere in the world and you can see some funny things. But, I've never heard someone get shot in Canada.</p>\n<p><strong>Did you hear someone get shot?</strong><br />\noh yeah, we were in Hamburg and we heard someone get shot near our apartment. But we were in this kind of rowdy area. We found out that it was a drug dealer who shot another drug dealer. It was one of those moments when you're like... that was clearly a gun shot.</p>\n<h6><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-184537\" src=\"http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_5615-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_5615 (2)\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_5615-2-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_5615-2-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_5615-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /> Kyle Fisher from The Dirty Nil at FEQ50. Photo by: Sabrina Spence</h6>\n<p><strong>When did you start playing the drums?</strong><br />\nWhen I was 13. But I wanted to play from a younger age after I played around with my friend's drum set in the 5th grade. He brought his drums to school and I saw him play and I was like, this is really cool. I was really interested in it and something about it grabbed my attention but then I didn't really try to push my parents to let me get one until I was 13 and playing drums in the school band in junior high.</p>\n<p><strong>What drummers have\u00a0influenced your playing?</strong><br />\nI started with John Bonham from Led Zeppelin, that was my first thing, and then Keith Moon. Both of them influenced me at the time because I thought their playing was so good. They're very different, John Bonham is not as flashy, he holds everything down really well and then he kinda has these perfect moments that if you know what you're listening for you're like \"oh that was just a brilliant little trill to change the song\" or just added a little flare for that moment. Keith Moon is just an animal all the time. I don't even think I can hear everything that he's doing all the time. As I got older and saw different people I liked them for different reasons. Zach Hill who played in Hella or Gerg Saunier from Dearhoof cause he showed me there's a lot you can do with little drums. I've never been a fan of drummers, except for Keith Moon, with massive drum sets.<br />\nYou can sound good if you just hit all those drums. But what can you do with just a kick drum and a high hat?</p>\n<p><strong>Where do you find your influences lie when you are putting an album together?</strong><br />\nI think it comes from all over the place. We all listen to different music all the time, Luke is listening to a lot of country music, especially right now. It's weird it doesn't really have any influence on how we sound but we just all listen to music that we like and then when it comes down to writing, I guess all of our different influences come out organically as we're putting the song together. I couldn't really pinpoint it one way or another. It's not like we just sit there and are like you know this song, in this part, we should do something like that. Luke will come in with his idea for a song, and a riff and then we'll just noodle around until it feels right. We don't think a song is done until we all like the song.\u00a0If we can't like it, who else is going to like it?</p>\n<h6><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-184534\" src=\"http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_5609-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_5609 (2)\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_5609-2-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_5609-2-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_5609-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /> Ross Miller from The Dirty Nil at FEQ50. Photo by: Sabrina Spence</h6>\n<p><strong>Now that you are playing more festivals has that changed how you feel in your career and as a band?</strong><br />\nI mean yes, certainly, anytime we play a show and there's enough - like any amount of people there that's are excited - like really want to see us play or are really into what we're doing, you can feel it from the stage. And that energy, it's weird you kind of feed off of it as a musician which is why post tour depression can be a thing for people when they get home. You ride this high all night long and that's why we do it. If all those people are having a good time, we feel it and then we're having a good time with them. But no matter what we're trying our best to put on a good show for everyone and that's kinda grown through the years as we've played more and more places we're seeing it. It's grown a lot here in Canada and now we're seeing it happen in other countries and it's very rewarding.</p>\n<p><strong>What was the thinking behind Minimum R&amp;B and re-releasing the older songs after Higher Power?</strong><br />\nIt was interesting because it started off first as\u00a0an old idea we had cause we had all these 7\" and it was like if all these run out we don't want to re-press all these 7\" cause it's going to cost a lot of money but if we did it all as one it would be a little cheaper. It was a really early conversation that went away for a while. Then when we started touring Higher Power and did more things across the world, we started to notice that more and more people just didn't know the older songs. Which we weren't used to right, because we've been playing those songs forever and most people started knowing us [for those songs]. We would assume they would have come from <em>Fucking up Young,\u00a0Smite</em> or any of those older Eps. So once we realized people didn't know these other songs, we thought it was a good way to bridge the gap between new fans and old fans. So that any new fans that couldn't get access to that music anymore got a way to get all of our older material. Kind of like if you like Higher Power, this is how we got there.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you excited for FEQ?</strong><br />\nIt's going to be crazy, we started our European tour and then they were like you guys are going to open for The Who, and we were freaking out. And that's huge, because The Who have been a huge inspiration for both Luke and I especially and Ross who is playing with us now. We all love The Who and it's one of those things that we never ever thought would happen. Why would they ever give a shit about having us open for them? I know it's the festival organizing it but it's just an honour to get to do that and Luke's really excited, it's his birthday that day too.</p>\n<h6><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-184532\" src=\"http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_5589-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_5589\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_5589-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_5589-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_5589-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /> Luke Bentham from The Dirty Nil at FEQ50.

The first one opened the night on the main stage, Sc\u00e8ne Bell on the Plains of Abraham. Crowds of people began running into the field as soon as the first beat dropped and by the end of their set the roar of the fans could be heard from miles away. DJ NDN hyped the crowd as the beats kept flowing resulting in a 45min set of pure energy.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:500px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\">\n<div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\">\n<div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BWd0OXigTvb/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">#ViewFromTheOffice #Work #festivaldete</a></p>\n<p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by Ian Campeau (@deejayndn) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2017-07-13T00:01:14+00:00\">Jul 12, 2017 at 5:01pm PDT</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script></p>\n<p>The second show was later that night at the Imperial Bell which is an intimate club in the downtown core of Quebec city. The drums of their music could be felt through your entire body. As the dance floor became more and more energized, the stomping of the dancing audience fell in unison to the bass, entrancing the crowd. As ATCR brought out their dancers the crowd became even more excited creating a sweaty dance party with crowd surfers riding just in front of the stage.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-184520\" src=\"http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Imperial-Bell-ATR-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Imperial Bell ATR\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Imperial-Bell-ATR-300x169.jpg 300w, http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Imperial-Bell-ATR-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Imperial-Bell-ATR-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Imperial-Bell-ATR.jpg 1548w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>Photo Credit: Vithiya Murugadas</p>\n<p>Both shows had completely different vibes but both were electrifying proving once again that A Tribe Called Red's nation is growing.</p>\n<p>We caught up with Bear Witness just before their shows in Quebec City to talk about the tour, changes in the band and <em>We are the Halluci Nation</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>How has your creative process changed since the beginning of A Tribe Called Red?</strong></p>\n<p>It\u2019s completely different since we started in 2008, we have different people in the group now. Part of the reason this album (<em>We are the Halluci Nation</em>) took almost three years in the making was getting used to working with 2oolman and figuring out what his process was like and what our process was like and finding our stride together. At the same time we were playing shows and trying to figure out how Tim (2oolman) worked into that as well. There was a curve that happened in learning how to work together but once we got there we definitely have something that is a lot deeper than what we had before.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you face any challenges, being that there are three of you? Is it difficult to get on the same page?</strong></p>\n<p>Everybody kind of gets their say\u2026 it would definitely be more difficult with 4 people. Three is a good number and as much as it is the three of us, its not... as we have a lot of people around us who are putting work into our albums.\u00a0 There is a whole machine around us that is helping shape what we do.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you feel like A Tribe Called Red has been able to facilitate a ground for upcoming Indigenous artists?</strong></p>\n<p>I definitely hope so; the amount of talent that lies within the Indigenous community in music alone is amazing. For a long time people outside of the Indigenous communities weren\u2019t necessarily listening to what was going on, if anything we have been able to upgrade that profile. We like to do whatever we can to support other Indigenous artists and you can see that with the amount of people we tried to include on <em>We are the Halluci Nation</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>There was so much more collaboration on this new album what was the process in looking for different artists to work with?</strong></p>\n<p>A lot of the people that we featured are friends who we have wanted to work with for a long time. As you are touring you become friends with people and you start to build up ideas and then the next cycle for creating an album happens and then all of sudden you go from three guys who create music from their bedrooms to knowing people to work with and having opportunities to bring together and bigger artists to collaborate with. We were told we could have bigger ideas on this album, we were told you guys can dream bigger now because you have achieved a certain level of success. The success of this album has really been opening up a lot of doors which I guess is how things work. The more exposure you get is the more opportunities.</p>\n<p><strong>Because you're touring more now with this album, \u00a0is it difficult to get back into the creative process?</strong></p>\n<p>That\u2019s kind of the way things work with music. You have time where you get to be really creative and there\u2019s times where you\u2019re just on the road which is generally a little less creative. We did record a lot for this album on the road but the actual construction of this album was when we took time off. Right now when the touring gets hectic it mostly just becomes about the live show more than anything else.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you prefer\u00a0club shows or festival shows?</strong></p>\n<p>They are really different experiences.\u00a0 There is something really amazing about a huge field of people that you can\u2019t really see the end of and the roar that comes off of a crowd like that but, then there is something completely different about playing to a crowd that is less than 10 feet away from you and you can touch and feel the venue. They both have their excitement.</p>\n<p><strong>Since your music is so rooted in your culture what is the reception like in Europe?</strong></p>\n<p>It\u2019s super different, it\u2019s always different to us when we aren\u2019t playing to an Indigenous audience. It\u2019s not that we make our music only for Indigenous people but to save time there is an understanding there. Even when we went to play in Mexico to people who had never heard of us before there was still an understanding and nothing needed to be explained.\u00a0 So in Europe that\u2019s the kind of boundary we face, but we could face that anywhere in Canada or the US too where people aren\u2019t necessarily understanding where our music is coming from and the larger picture around it. That can be draining sometimes to have to explain yourself or feel that people do not understand exactly what you are doing.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you get into Dj-ing?</strong></p>\n<p>I have been obsessed with music from a really young age. I was never a person who could play music. My family is all artists and when they noticed I had an interest in music they put me in music classes and playing instruments just never came to me. But I was still obsessed with it and I had a huge music collection and when my friends went to Peterborough for university I would show up to their houses with a big bag of CDs and tapes and hangout in their living rooms and play them music. I met another group of Djs there and one of them showed me how to DJ and kind of forced me into it. My friends basically said you have all this music and you love it so much you need to do something with it.</p>\n<p><strong>Who are the musicians that you have looked up to?</strong></p>\n<p>All my DJ-ing is based in Reggae and Dancehall and Jamaican music and lately I have been really digging into the roots of what got me into Dj-ing with artists like Lee Scratch Perry, King Tubby, Scientist and the Mad Professor.\u00a0 All that kind of Dub music really inspired me to DJ but my love for music really stretches further and wider than that \u2026another one of my favorite artist is Tom Waites.</p>\n<p><strong>What is coming up next after the tour?</strong></p>\n<p>Right now its one foot in front of the other.\u00a0 Doing the tour is definitely all that\u2019s on anyone\u2019s mind right now and hopefully a break after that. Getting back into the studio is definitely something we all want to do within the next year.</p>\n<p>A Tribe Called Red continues their <a href=\"http://atribecalledred.com/tour/\">tour </a>and will be at the Ottawa Bluefest this Friday July 14th and then over to the west coast of Canada and the US.

The Vancouver-based singer-songwriter, better known for his work under the name Prairie Cat, released his fourth album, <em>Is Cary Pratt</em>, to warm reviews. He also went on a tour covering most of eastern Canada to promote it, performing in Newfoundland, Quebec, Ontario, and all three Maritime provinces.</p>\n<p>I had the treat of seeing Pratt at one of two Toronto dates on the tour. It was an intimate show at the Monarch Tavern, a hidden-away speakeasy on the outskirts of Toronto's Little Italy. A mellow, low-key show, Pratt\u00a0lived\u00a0up the the one man band billing as he performed vocals from behind a drum kit and keyboard.</p>\n<p>His music is a nostalgic brand of soft pop, markedly influenced by the past but never derivative. He was quoted on his musical ambitions in a recent <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/2017/06/16/your-new-favourite-thing-prairie-cat-builds-a-retreat-from-todays-trends.html\">Toronto Star article</a>:</p>\n<p>\u201cI write and record music that aims to attract listeners who have trouble relating to the mainstream or the \u00fcber-indie. I use familiar themes and tones while bending traditional music convention in order to (incite) nostalgia while still trying to create a style that sounds new and interesting. Humour and sarcasm disarm heavy subject matter and visually I always try to keep things light.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pratt made his name as a drummer in British Columbia in the 90's, but soon found that he wanted more creative control over his work.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs a drummer you\u2019re always at the whim of when temperamental songwriters feel like writing songs and playing shows. They go through their trials and tribulations, and you\u2019re sort of just there,\u201d Pratt recently said to <a href=\"http://beatroute.ca/2017/06/12/prairie-cat-theres-something-carry-pratt/\">beatroute.ca.</a></p>\n<p>A thoroughly professional effort,<em> Is Cary Pratt</em> is a great example of what can happen when unconventional artists riff on traditional music. It probably isn't for everyone, but it hits all its marks.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/csuuYHXgXJ8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><em>Post by Dan Goldsmith</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/news/2017/06/30/album-review-prairie-cats-is-cary-pratt/\">Album Review: Prairie Cat&#8217;s Is Cary Pratt</a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/author/admin/\">Chart Attack</a> | <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com\">Chart Attack</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.chartattack.com/news/2017/06/30/album-review-prairie-cats-is-cary-pratt/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>REVIEW: !!!

(ChkChkChk) and I can honestly say nothing would have prepared me for what I was about to experience. Leading up to the show I was wary, my observations of the crowd indicated that my friend and I were definitely half the age of majority of the people there. I was terrified that I dragged my friend to a show she\u2019d regret and that somehow not being the target demographic would make the show unpleasant for me. In that moment I forgot how music transcends sociocultural characteristics and !!!\u2019s non-stop high energy performance and equally enthusiastic crowd reminded me of that.</p>\n<p>Waiting patiently for the show to start, I looked down at my phone for about 3 minutes in-between the opening act, Prince Ness, and !!! and before I knew it, the dance floor doubled with fans waiting in anticipation. Looking back this was a telltale sign of the night to come. As we slowly approached show time I watched more and more people gather to the front of the stage to the point where there was barely anyone sitting down. At 10:30pm on the dot lead singer Nic Offer and back-up singer Meah Pace immediately got the party started and it was non-stop for the whole night. Even waiting for the mandatory encore was quick.</p>\n<p>Veterans of the music scene, it\u2019s no surprise that !!! knew how to put on a showstopper. With 7 albums to draw from, it\u2019s no wonder that the band didn\u2019t over-rely on their newest album <em>Shake The Shudder</em>. The set list had banger after banger with no breaks in-between including hits such as \u201cFreedom!\u201d, \u201cSlyd\u201d, \u201cThe One 2\u201d, \u201cDancing Is The Best Revenge\u201d and \u201cHeart of Hearts\u201d. Offer and Pace were the perfect duo that created an entertaining performance with hand whirling, head bobbing dance moves. Their unapologetic dancing was truly infectious and in no time everyone was in the groove. At one point Offer mentioned high-fiving everyone in the crowd and he stayed true to his word when he jumped off stage doing just that. The fun atmosphere and upbeat dance-punk jams bonded the audience while demonstrating how !!! are literally the embodiment of their band name. !!! described\u00a0<em>Shake The Shudder</em> as \u201ca fancy way of saying \u2018shake it off and dance your cares away\u2019\u201d and despite my initial doubts, I left thinking they accomplished exactly that.</p>\n<p>Check out\u00a0<em>Shake the Shudder </em>below!</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/7ck0mlarsb5RKF2IYcHaPy\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><br />\nPost by : Tayler Wong</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/news/2017/06/17/live-review-chkchkchk/\">REVIEW: !!!
