With its many different strands, it can be difficult to navigate, but while its sheer scale makes it notoriously uneven in terms of the quality of the films screened, it remains sufficiently prestigious to attract film folk from around the world, not to mention very sizeable local audiences.</p>\n<p>There are a number of UK co-productions in the programme this year, most notably, perhaps, the British-German opening night movie <strong>Isle of Dogs</strong>. Wes Anderson\u2019s second animated film (after 2009\u2019s Fantastic Mr. Fox), it\u2019s set in a dystopian Japan of the future and tells of a 12-year-old orphan and his dog who team up with some other canine friends exiled on a garbage dump to wage war against the corruption of the adult world. The writer-director has stated, somewhat intriguing, that his stop-motion fable is influenced by the films of Akira Kurosawa \u2013 presumably Kurosawa\u2019s own 1970 rubbish-dump saga Dodes&#8217;ka-den.</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/real-estate-the-2018-001-woman-opens-fire-ORIGINAL.jpg?itok=br2S0po8\" alt=\"The Real Estate (2018)\" title=\"The Real Estate (2018)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/real-estate-the-2018-001-woman-opens-fire-ORIGINAL.jpg?itok=br2S0po8\" alt=\"The Real Estate (2018)\" title=\"The Real Estate (2018)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">The Real Estate (2018)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Also in the main competition is the Swedish-British <strong>The Real Estate</strong>. M\u00e5ns M\u00e5nsson and Axel Peters\u00e9n\u2019s film centres on a sixtysomething woman who returns to Stockholm, from a life of luxury in the sun, when her father leaves her an apartment in the city \u2013 since this legacy turns out to be something of a curse, it\u2019s unclear at this stage whether the film is a drama or comedy.</p>\n<p>That, at least, cannot be said of the American-British <strong>Entebbe</strong>, which screens in the main selection but out of competition. Directed by Jos\u00e9 Padilha, the Brazilian director of Bus 174 and Elite Squad (which won the Golden Bear at the 2008 Berlinale), the film apparently makes use of new research in revisiting the hijacking of an Air France flight from Tel Aviv to Paris, and focuses both on the hostages and on the Israeli government\u2019s efforts to resolve the situation. The cast boasts Rosamund Pike, Daniel Br\u00fchl, Eddie Marsan and Denis Menochet.</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33333333333\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/7-days-in-entebbe-2018-001-rosamund-pike-daniel-bruhl-ORIGINAL.jpg?itok=ytrJXL1n\" alt=\"7 Days in Entebbe (2018)\" title=\"7 Days in Entebbe (2018)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33333333333\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/7-days-in-entebbe-2018-001-rosamund-pike-daniel-bruhl-ORIGINAL.jpg?itok=ytrJXL1n\" alt=\"7 Days in Entebbe (2018)\" title=\"7 Days in Entebbe (2018)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">7 Days in Entebbe (2018)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Three films with UK funding are included among the special galas. The Catalan writer-director Isabel Coixet, a Berlin favourite, returns with <strong>The Bookshop</strong>, an adaptation of Penelope Fitzgerald\u2019s novella about a young widow who scandalises a Suffolk town in the 1950s by opening a bookshop and selling controversial fiction. The cast looks promising: Emily Mortimer as the protagonist, with Bill Nighy, Patricia Clarkson and Frances Barber in support.</p>\n<p>Rupert Everett, meanwhile, makes his debut as writer-director with <strong>The Happy Prince</strong> (a German-Belgian-Italian-British production), in which he also stars as Oscar Wilde, dealing with the trials and tribulations of his final years; the cast includes Emily Watson, Tom Wilkinson and Colin Firth. And third, the British documentary <strong>Songwriter</strong> offers a fly-on-the-wall portrait of Ed Sheeran. Since director Murray Cummings is the singer\u2019s cousin, one shouldn\u2019t, perhaps, expect too much of a warts-and-all approach.</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.49978623343\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/happy-prince-the-2018-001-rupert-everett-reclining-ORIGINAL.jpg?itok=sflQ-Bp3\" alt=\"The Happy Prince (2018)\" title=\"The Happy Prince (2018)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.49978623343\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/happy-prince-the-2018-001-rupert-everett-reclining-ORIGINAL.jpg?itok=sflQ-Bp3\" alt=\"The Happy Prince (2018)\" title=\"The Happy Prince (2018)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">The Happy Prince (2018)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Four UK funded films are playing in the Panorama section. The one with the highest profile is surely <strong>Yardie</strong>, which marks Idris Elba\u2019s feature debut as director. Backed with National Lottery funding via the BFI Film Fund, it\u2019s an adaptation of Victor Headley\u2019s novel about a drug-dealer in 1980s London who\u2019s seeking revenge for the murder of his brother in Jamaica a decade earlier. Aml Ameen, of Kidulthood, takes the lead.</p>\n<p>Timur Bekmambetov\u2019s intriguing-sounding <strong>Profile</strong> is a docudrama of sorts based on the experiences of journalist Anna Erelle, who went undercover for an investigative report into Isis\u2019s methods of recruiting women. The other two British co-productions in the strand are both documentary portraits of musicians: Philipp Jedicke\u2019s <strong>Shut Up and Play the Piano</strong> centres on Jason Charles Beck, better known as musical chameleon Chilly Gonzales, and features archive footage and interviews with Gonzalez, Peaches, Jarvis Cocker and others; while Steve Loveridge\u2019s feature debut <strong>MATANGI/ MAYA/ M.I.A</strong> focuses on Mathangi \u2018Maya\u2019 Arulpragasam \u2013 alias iconic pop singer M.I.A. \u2013 and her sometimes controversial use of music for political purposes in support of the Tamil rebels. Again we are promised plenty of archive footage, much of it shot in Sri Lanka by the singer herself.</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.50235546039\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/yardie-2017-002-riaze-foster-aml-ameen-arguing-with-gun-outdoors-ORIGINAL.jpg?itok=D7JM8yG9\" alt=\"Yardie (2017)\" title=\"Yardie (2017)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.50235546039\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/yardie-2017-002-riaze-foster-aml-ameen-arguing-with-gun-outdoors-ORIGINAL.jpg?itok=D7JM8yG9\" alt=\"Yardie (2017)\" title=\"Yardie (2017)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Yardie (2017)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>In Berlin\u2019s Forum Expanded section, which screens experimental work, can be found Zach Blas\u2019s <strong>Contra-Internet: Jubilee 2033</strong>, a time-travel fantasy about Ayn Rand in a dystopian Silicon Valley of the future; <strong>The Rare Event</strong>, a multi-faceted document, by occasional collaborators Ben Rivers and Ben Russell, of a Parisian philosophical conference about resistance; and <strong>Song for Europe</strong>, a short by much-feted veteran John Smith that celebrates Britain\u2019s beneath-the-waves connection to Europe.</p>\n<p>Other British shorts playing in Berlin include, in the main short-film competition, Jayisha Patel\u2019s <strong>Circle</strong>, a documentary about violence against women in India; in the Generation 14+ section, Charlotte Regan\u2019s <strong>Fry-Up</strong>, about a teenager preparing for a big day, and Lara Zeidan\u2019s <strong>Three Centimetres</strong>, about four Lebanese girls facing a critical point in their friendship; and finally, in the Generation K+ section, Christopher Villiers\u2019 <strong>Snow for Water</strong>, about a girl and her young brother caught up in the siege of Sarajevo.</p>\n<p>Something for everyone, in other words.</p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n   <link>http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/british-films-berlin-2018</link>\n   <author>Geoff  Andrew</author>\n   <media:content url=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/google_newsstand_1x1/public/news/isle-of-dogs-2018-002-five-dogs-ORIGINAL-1000x750.jpg?itok=mov0Nd4s\" type=\"image/jpeg\" expression=\"full\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\">\n    <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[British films at Berlin 2018]]></media:description>\n   </media:content>\n  </item>\n  <item>\n   <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/10-great-films-about-brief-encounters</guid>\n   <pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\n   <title>10 great films about brief encounters</title>\n   <description>&lt;div class=&quot;rss-content-container&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Before Sunrise to In the Mood for Love, there&amp;#8217;s nothing so achingly romantic on screen as a brief encounter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</description>\n   <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class=\"rss-content-container\"><p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33333333333\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/in-the-mood-for-love-2000-004-lovers-in-side-street-1000x750.jpg?itok=OJajLhAV\" alt=\"In the Mood for Love (2000)\" title=\"In the Mood for Love (2000)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33333333333\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/in-the-mood-for-love-2000-004-lovers-in-side-street-1000x750.jpg?itok=OJajLhAV\" alt=\"In the Mood for Love (2000)\" title=\"In the Mood for Love (2000)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">In the Mood for Love (2000)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Some of the most romantic films achieve their heightened feelings through the structure of a brief encounter. It\u2019s a dramatic construction involving limited time and an accident of chance, with a neat beginning, middle and end: the protagonists meet, fall in love, but part due to the obstacles of an uncaring world. The lovers experience a fleeting yet passionate liaison, one left unscathed by the mundanities of everyday life, resulting in a potent mix of pleasure and pain that stimulates the mind as well as the heart.</p>\n<p>Stimulation of an explicitly sexual nature, however, is relatively rare in this sub-genre \u2013 for fear of ruining the mood. From films such as David Lean\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b6ee847\">Summer Madness</a> (1955), where sex is coyly signified by fireworks, to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Fonteyne\u2019s misleadingly titled <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b820bdf4b\">Une liaison pornographique</a> (1999), where the kinkiness remains mostly off screen, a sense of almost idealistic modesty and restraint prevails.</p>\n<p>The films often share comparable settings (cities, holidays and transport such as trains ensure useful anonymity and allow swift departures), themes (memory, the nature of time and potential turning points explored or left untaken frequently recur) and a similarity of feeling. It\u2019s their noble romantic sentiments coupled with a refusal to provide unrealistic fairytale endings \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba9fc0fb4\">Richard Linklater</a> speaks of \u201cromance for realists\u201d \u2013 that makes them so compelling. But the intoxication of love remains. As C\u00e9line in <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8a2a9046\">Before Sunset</a> (2004) says, paraphrasing Albert Einstein: \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe in any kind of magic or mystery, you\u2019re basically as good as dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Here are 10 great films celebrating the magic of the brief encounter.</p>\n<h3>Partie de campagne (1936)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong> Jean Renoir</span></p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33421052632\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/partie-de-campagne-1936-003-couple-bfi-00m-mju.jpg?itok=tl8HqUAV\" alt=\"Partie de campagne (1936)\" title=\"Partie de campagne (1936)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33421052632\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/partie-de-campagne-1936-003-couple-bfi-00m-mju.jpg?itok=tl8HqUAV\" alt=\"Partie de campagne (1936)\" title=\"Partie de campagne (1936)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Based on a Maupassant short story, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b2a3772\">Partie de campagne</a> was originally shot in 1936 but abandoned due to bad weather and director <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f3f0b7e\">Jean Renoir</a>\u2019s commitment to Les Bas-fonds, only finally being pieced together 10 years later. The resulting 40-minute featurette, with a poignant score by <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9fd8c6b7\">Joseph Kosma</a>, is a warm, comic, lyrical ode to nature as well as a moving, melancholic romance.</p>\n<p>When a Parisian family take a countryside picnic, wife and daughter are courted by two local men who take them on the river. Daughter Henriette (a magnificent <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f8b772e\">Sylvia Bataille</a>), stirred by her immersion in nature, succumbs to the worldlier Henri\u2019s advances after being distracted by that portent of love, a nightingale. The famous close-up of Henriette\u2019s tear-filled eye suggests both her deflowering and the pain of love in a society that forces her instead to enter a loveless marriage. As a touching coda makes clear, the lovers \u2013 briefly reunited years later \u2013 are left with a memory that continues to affect their lives.</p>\n<h3>Casablanca (1942)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director\u00a0</strong>Michael Curtiz</span></p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.29032258065\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/casablanca-1942-004-humphrey-bogart-ingrid-bergman-00n-20v.jpg?itok=H1C7Wc-6\" alt=\"Casablanca (1942)\" title=\"Casablanca (1942)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.29032258065\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/casablanca-1942-004-humphrey-bogart-ingrid-bergman-00n-20v.jpg?itok=H1C7Wc-6\" alt=\"Casablanca (1942)\" title=\"Casablanca (1942)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Although <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b82020179\">Casablanca</a> is an inspiring tale of Second World War heroism in the face of the Nazi threat, this alone would not account for the film\u2019s enduring success. Rather, it\u2019s the transposing of the themes of valor and sacrifice to an unselfish love story \u2013 between <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f15818b\">Humphrey Bogart</a>\u2019s cynical and disillusioned American caf\u00e9 owner Rick and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1256f1b\">Ingrid Bergman</a>\u2019s conflicted, brave Ilsa Lund \u2013 that makes the film such a time-honoured classic.</p>\n<p>Casablanca demonstrates the quintessential contradiction inherent in brief encounters \u2013 that as viewers we feel the lovers belong together and deserve the happiness they so desire, yet we yearn to see them forced apart, providing the ultimately more rewarding ending. At the airport, when Rick makes the noble decision to send Ilsa and resistance hero Victor Laszlo (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba164697e\">Paul Henreid</a>) safely away, he ensures that we\u2019re left feeling elated at both the noble actions witnessed and the high ideals of selfless love achieved.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/Online/casablanca2018\">Buy tickets to Casablanca at BFI Southbank</a></li>\n</ul><h3>Brief Encounter (1945)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong>\u00a0David Lean</span></p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33648393195\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/brief-encounter-1945-007-celia-johnson-trevor-howard-in-cafe.jpg?itok=ibetwtz4\" alt=\"Brief Encounter (1945)\" title=\"Brief Encounter (1945)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33648393195\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/brief-encounter-1945-007-celia-johnson-trevor-howard-in-cafe.jpg?itok=ibetwtz4\" alt=\"Brief Encounter (1945)\" title=\"Brief Encounter (1945)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>One of the most stoic of romances, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6a66b375\">Brief Encounter</a> scrutinises the contrast between the heart\u2019s desire and the realities of middle-class England.

A selection of the director\u2019s key films plays at cinemas nationwide.</p>\n</div>\n<p>French and Saunders\u2019s images are torn straight from the pages of <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9ee60a60\">Ingmar Bergman\u2019s</a> screenplays for films such as <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b61b4e8\">The Seventh Seal</a> (1957), <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6adbf5f5\">The Virgin Spring</a> (1960) and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b510d37\">Through a Glass Darkly</a> (1961), films that have, of late, fallen out of fashion. Indeed today they might be considered so wilfully opaque and mired in symbolism as to be past the point of parody. Bergman\u2019s oeuvre epitomises a type of art cinema that marries philosophical conceits with explicit treatments of sexuality, a type that was very much of its time. In 1958 the journalist Leslie Mallory could write: \u201cNo director, British or foreign, has ever been honoured in this country as Bergman has. No director in history has had three of his pictures included in the best ten of the year, as he has! You can get tickets for \u2018My Fair Lady\u2019 more easily than for the summer-long season of Bergman\u2019s films now running at the National Film Theatre.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine that the current BFI season marking Bergman\u2019s centenary will be outselling Hamilton. Still, it\u2019s possible that contemporary audiences might find a poignancy in Bergman\u2019s idiosyncratic brand of existentialism, and in particular its concern with what to believe in after the death of God.</p>\n<p>Matters of faith and doubt have long pervaded film. From Epstein and Dreyer, Bazin and Bresson through Tarkovsky and Kieslowski to von Trier and Scorsese: a line of canonical directors has used cinema to investigate the meaning of life \u2013 and culture \u2013 in a godless world. None, though, did so quite as zealously as Bergman, a filmmaker who described himself as a \u201cconjurer\u201d: a sophisticated, technologically savvy magician whose raw material is nothing other than our \u201cincredible need to believe\u201d. \u201cWhen I show a film, I am guilty of deceit,\u201d he wrote in Why I Make Movies, the essay he issued as an introduction to the published screenplay of The Seventh Seal. \u201cI use an apparatus which is constructed to take advantage of a certain weakness, an apparatus with which I can sway my audience in a highly emotional manner \u2013 make them laugh, scream with fright, smile, believe in fairy stories, become indignant, feel shocked, charmed, deeply moved.\u201d</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.29776496035\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/winter-light-1962-001-vicar-woman-fighting.jpg?itok=vpwRDZtv\" alt=\"Winter Light (1962)\" title=\"Winter Light (1962)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.29776496035\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/winter-light-1962-001-vicar-woman-fighting.jpg?itok=vpwRDZtv\" alt=\"Winter Light (1962)\" title=\"Winter Light (1962)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Winter Light (1962)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>More than any other filmmaker, it is Bergman who implanted the idea of director as God. In Jane Magnusson and Hynek Pallas\u2019s 2013 documentary Trespassing Bergman, for example, in which a steady stream of great directors makes pilgrimage to Bergman\u2019s home on the island of Far\u00f6, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bc335bc6c\">Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu</a> exclaims upon entering the hallowed rooms: \u201cIf cinema was a religion, this would be Mecca, the Vatican\u2026 the centre of it all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bergman\u2019s work is intensely personal, intimate. Yet the director\u2019s distinct sense of humility stands at ironic odds with his reputation as the quintessential auteur. For Bergman, art had to be part of something else \u2013 something deeper, grander, more ancient; a larger human project. The artist, meanwhile, must transcend himself, leave his ego at the cinema door. He wrote: \u201cIt is my opinion that art lost its basic creative drive the moment it was separated from worship. In former days the artist remained unknown and his work was to the glory of God. He lived and died without being more or less important than other artisans; \u2018eternal values\u2019, \u2018immortality\u2019 and \u2018masterpiece\u2019 were terms not applicable to his case. The ability to create was a gift.\u201d Asked what he wanted the general purpose of his films to be, he replied: \u201cI want to be one of the artists in the cathedral on the great plain\u2026. Regardless of whether I believe or not, whether I am a Christian or not, I would play my part in the collective building of the cathedral.\u201d</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/seventh-seal-the-1957-007-flagellants.jpg?itok=rp49trdy\" alt=\"The Seventh Seal (1957)\" title=\"The Seventh Seal (1957)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/seventh-seal-the-1957-007-flagellants.jpg?itok=rp49trdy\" alt=\"The Seventh Seal (1957)\" title=\"The Seventh Seal (1957)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">The Seventh Seal (1957)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Although he described himself as an agnostic, religion \u2013 or at least its loss \u2013 was a longstanding concern of Bergman\u2019s. It became the main focus for his films in the late 1950s and early 1960s. While works such as The Seventh Seal and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6c00344e\">The Magician</a> (aka The Face, 1958) are critical of institutional religion, they nevertheless float the possibility of spiritual connection. \u2018Grace\u2019 isn\u2019t a word that fits easily into Bergman\u2019s vocabulary, but something like it can be found in the moments of human communion dotted throughout these films.</p>\n<p>Such glad moments begin to fade in the first pair of films that make up Bergman\u2019s Faith Trilogy, though: Through a Glass Darkly and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b1495b2\">Winter Light</a> (1962); by the time of the concluding part, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b94a861\">The Silence</a> (1963), they have disappeared altogether, replaced by a dystopic vision of humanity abandoned by God. Gradually, it becomes clear these are films not about faith, but about the crisis of faith that haunts modern life.</p>\n<p>Bergman described the trajectory of the three films as moving from \u201ccertainty achieved\u201d to \u201ccertainty unmasked\u201d to \u201cGod\u2019s silence \u2013 the negative impression\u201d. But any certainty offered by Through a Glass Darkly \u2013 the tale of a young schizophrenic woman, Karin, haunted by visions while on holiday with her family on a remote island \u2013 is ultimately undermined. The vision of God that Karin \u2013 a woman who seduces her own brother \u2013 sees creeping out of the cracks in the wallpaper takes the shape of a spider; moments later a helicopter arrives to cart her off to an asylum. In the wake of this nightmare, her feckless father David\u2019s efforts to reassure his long-neglected 17-year-old son Minus that \u201cGod is love\u201d ring horribly hollow. And Minus\u2019s damp-eyed declaration, following this discussion, that finally, \u201cPapa talked to me\u201d is a clich\u00e9 that closes the film on a false note.</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.43255073617\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/through-a-glass-darkly-1961-002-boy-girl-beach.jpeg?itok=Qo0cByiA\" alt=\"Through a Glass Darkly (1961)\" title=\"Through a Glass Darkly (1961)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.43255073617\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/through-a-glass-darkly-1961-002-boy-girl-beach.jpeg?itok=Qo0cByiA\" alt=\"Through a Glass Darkly (1961)\" title=\"Through a Glass Darkly (1961)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Through a Glass Darkly (1961)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Bergman claimed that doubts about the ending of Through a Glass Darkly caused him to write Winter Light as a \u2018sequel\u2019 of sorts, rejecting David\u2019s self-protecting God of love. The film turns around the dwindling faith and shrinking congregation of a pastor, Tomas Ericsson \u2013 a character who is a mix of both Bergman and his father, Erik, a Lutheran minister and later chaplain to the King of Sweden; Ericsson is both \u2018Eric\u2019 and \u2018Eric\u2019s son\u2019 \u2013 who reaches crisis point after a communicant, Jonas, reveals that his despair of the world and fear of China\u2019s atom bomb has led him to consider suicide.</p>\n<p>Far from offering reassuring platitudes, Tomas confesses that his participation in the Spanish Civil War and the death of his wife have turned his loving God \u201cinto a spider God\u201d. Jonas duly kills himself, and Tomas wonders if there is no God at all. As his lover M\u00e4rta \u2013 an atheist, the sanest person in the three films and Tomas\u2019s only real hope at redemptive love \u2013 puts it, \u201cGod doesn\u2019t speak. God hasn\u2019t ever spoken, because he doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s all unreservedly, horribly simple.\u201d</p>\n<p>The question of God\u2019s silence permeates Winter Light\u2019s close-ups of the characters\u2019 tortured faces, its long, stark shots of the woodland where Jonas\u2019s body is found and its taut, clipped conversations. At the film\u2019s end, one character suggests to Tomas that far worse than Christ\u2019s physical suffering was the pain he must have endured on realising that his disciples, during the course of his ministry, had \u201csimply not grasped what he meant. Not a word. They abandoned him\u2026 And he was left alone.\u201d Worse still is the thought \u2013 Christ\u2019s thought on the cross \u2013 that God had forsaken him. \u201cEverything he\u2019d been preaching was a lie. The moments before he died, Christ was seized with a great doubt. Surely that must have been his most monstrous suffering of all.\u201d</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.27840909091\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/the-silence-1963-001-interior-group-of-three.jpeg?itok=8E2QkL_L\" alt=\"The Silence (1963)\" title=\"The Silence (1963)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.27840909091\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/the-silence-1963-001-interior-group-of-three.jpeg?itok=8E2QkL_L\" alt=\"The Silence (1963)\" title=\"The Silence (1963)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">The Silence (1963)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>In The Silence Bergman took this monstrosity to its logical extreme, not only avoiding all mention of God but reducing the role of language almost to an irrelevance. Its action takes place in an unidentified city where the citizens speak an unidentified and untranslated language. Here, two sisters \u2013 one of whom, Ester, is in the throes of a painful illness \u2013 hole up in a sinister hotel, inhabited by weird carnivalesque performers. Anna\u2019s ten-year-old son Johan wanders aimlessly through hotel corridors; his mother has a disaffected sexual encounter. Ester seems to recover, then relapses into agonising convulsions. An army tank makes its ominous way through empty streets. The atmosphere is sickly, static. The clock ticks; nothing moves forward. Not even art offers solace: the film ends abruptly, unresolved. The film is haunted by the metaphysical fallout of the end of Western values. The crisis of language is the mirror of the larger one faced by the modern world. If the other films float the possibility of nihilism, The Silence is nothing short of a gaze into the abyss.</p>\n<p>How far removed are such questions of love, of despair, from today\u2019s culture? The god discussed within Bergman\u2019s films is, after all, a Christian one, and as Nick Pinkerton put it in an article in this magazine (Mystical Magery Tour, <a href=\"/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/april-2017-issue\">S&amp;S April 2017</a>), Christianity is still something of a dirty word among liberal elites. Hence perhaps the critical opprobrium surrounding Scorsese\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8bebccd8\">Silence</a> last year, and the outright contempt for the crowd-pleasing schmaltz of films such as Miracles from Heaven (2016).</p>\n<p>Still, religiosity survives, albeit in disguised forms. Filmmakers such as Terrence Malick, Eug\u00e8ne Green and the Dardenne brothers continue to make films shot through with a kind of amorphous spirituality, what Pinkerton calls \u201cnew mystic cinema\u201d; while John Michael McDonagh\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/518c21018474d\">Calvary</a> (2013) and Pawel Pawlikowski\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/528fe662a16c5\">Ida</a> (2014) seem to be direct homages to Bergman. Churches may be empty but religion has found other, subtler outlets. Forms of philanthropy, transhumanism, yoga, clean-eating (\u201cmy body is a temple\u201d) and even environmentalism could be considered spiritual experiences. After the hedonistic, capitalist self-interest of the late 20th century, a vocabulary of care, responsibility and love has seeped back into our language. So too has a sense of abandonment. Witness the disoriented millennials of TBS\u2019s TV series Search Party: a brilliant satire about the lengths that a group of young New Yorkers will go to imbue their otherwise banal lives with significance.</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.3342019544\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/ida-2013-003-praying-by-roadside.jpg?itok=jGYAYnFN\" alt=\"Ida (2013)\" title=\"Ida (2013)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.3342019544\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/ida-2013-003-praying-by-roadside.jpg?itok=jGYAYnFN\" alt=\"Ida (2013)\" title=\"Ida (2013)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Ida (2013)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s possible that such existentialist crises are the privilege of mostly white moneyed classes, as the makers of Search Party suggest. But a quick look at <a href=\"/node/17667\">Sight &amp; Sound\u2019s best films of 2017</a> shows a series of works unconnected by nation, race or subject matter, yet all displaying a deepseated anxiety about our loss of connection with one another, our inability to make sense of the past or present, our abandonment by \u2013 and of \u2013 any purpose higher than ourselves. With the age of irony withering, could Bergman\u2019s kind of earnestness have a renewed resonance? It\u2019s just possible. Bergman believed that even though God may not exist, our worship of him has cast a long shadow on the history of humankind. Films such as Get Out, Zama, Western, Loveless \u2013 as well as the exercise in symbolism that is Twin Peaks: The Return \u2013 stand in that shadow, making clear, just as the trilogy does, that an absent god shapes our history quite as effectively as a present one would do.</p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n   <link>http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/features/ingmar-bergman-keeping-faith-what-he-means-now</link>\n   <author>Catherine  Wheatley</author>\n   <media:content url=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/google_newsstand_1x1/public/news/ingmar-bergman-viewfinder-chair-1000x750-CROP.jpg?itok=ePhu0gO2\" type=\"image/jpeg\" expression=\"full\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\">\n    <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Keeping the faith: what Ingmar Bergman means now]]></media:description>\n   </media:content>\n  </item>\n  <item>\n   <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/elmer-bernstein-10-essential-soundtracks</guid>\n   <pubDate>Fri, 09 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\n   <title>Elmer Bernstein: 10 essential soundtracks</title>\n   <description>&lt;div class=&quot;rss-content-container&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;From The Magnificent Seven to Ghostbusters, Elmer Bernstein is the maestro behind some of Hollywood&amp;#8217;s most memorable scores.

Frank Sinatra facing the sheer depths of addiction. A paranormal incursion into the Big Apple. These are classic images of cinema, but their power owes a great deal to the accompanying music by film composer Elmer Bernstein, who wrote classic scores for True Grit (1969), The Man with the Golden Arm (1955) and Ghostbusters (1984) among more than 200 screen credits.</p>\n<p>While he was nominated for Oscars 14 times (he was successful once \u2013 for 1967\u2019s Thoroughly Modern Millie) and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Bernstein never became a household name. But there&#8217;s no doubt you&#8217;ll recognise the music he composed. From finger-clicking jazz to thrilling, galloping brass to sumptuous classical, he was one of the best.</p>\n<p>Born in New York City, he studied with Aaron Copland before joining the army, where he was asked to write patriotic folk music. After leaving he began writing for low-budget films such as Saturday&#8217;s Hero (1951) but eventually graduated to working with the likes of Cecil B. DeMille.</p>\n<p>From there his career flourished. He won plaudits for scoring every kind of film, from Disney animation to frat comedies, all helping further the legend of Elmer Bernstein.</p>\n<h3>The Man with the Golden Arm (1955)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"bfi-third-party-embed-spotify-container\">\n  <iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"80\" data-src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:2wXCIjAqdOhg4zjvmQqDjK\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</p>\n<p>Two of the most recognisable elements of Otto Preminger&#8217;s adaptation of Nelson Algren&#8217;s novel about heroin addiction are the Saul Bass-designed opening credits and Bernstein&#8217;s swinging jazz theme, both indelible cinema moments that seem destined to forever be intertwined.</p>\n<h3>The Ten Commandments (1956)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"bfi-third-party-embed-spotify-container\">\n  <iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"80\" data-src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:2OYXAhbOKklNobw2kVVxDh\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</p>\n<p>Cecil B. DeMille&#8217;s only instruction to Bernstein was that his music for this Biblical epic shouldn\u2019t sound like screaming jazz. On the contrary, Bernstein created a huge leitmotif-driven golden age classic, which rivals Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa&#8217;s music for Ben-Hur (1959) as one of the great epic scores.</p>\n<h3>The Magnificent Seven (1960)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"bfi-third-party-embed-spotify-container\">\n  <iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"80\" data-src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:5bx34I881oO8onP8gvUb7n\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</p>\n<p>Keen not to get pigeonholed as a jazz composer, Bernstein asked Charlton Heston to help recommend him for westerns. He would go on to write perhaps the most famous theme from the genre, infusing the score with as much energy as possible to drive the narrative along. The Magnificent Seven theme is still widely performed today.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/Online/magnificentseven2018\">Buy tickets for The Magnificent Seven at BFI Southbank</a></li>\n</ul><h3>To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"bfi-third-party-embed-spotify-container\">\n  <iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"80\" data-src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:2QhOZRbOoIZakEAhrLIEnP\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</p>\n<p>For this acclaimed adaptation of the Harper Lee novel, Bernstein languished for weeks trying to come up with a sound for what is perhaps his greatest work, before realising he needed to go through the eyes of the children. What followed was an incredible musical vision of the things our kids represent the most: innate goodness and hope.</p>\n<h3>Walk on the Wild Side (1962)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"bfi-third-party-embed-spotify-container\">\n  <iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"80\" data-src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:5YNkln5DRm0zGycec8D0NN\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</p>\n<p>Like The Man with the Golden Arm before it, this star-studded drama was adapted from a novel by Nelson Algren. Designer Saul Bass again provided a stunning main title sequence, involving prowling cats, while Bernstein&#8217;s thick brass created a smoky atmosphere perfect for the steamy melodrama.</p>\n<h3>The Great Escape (1963)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"bfi-third-party-embed-spotify-container\">\n  <iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"80\" data-src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:2YbZjZcBzf9bx8J20a4pXy\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</p>\n<p>Director John Sturges trusted Bernstein so much that he didn&#8217;t give him the script for his war yarn, instead just telling him the story. Bernstein more than justified his trust with an insanely catchy melody that still remains a kind of sonic shorthand for making an escape today.</p>\n<h3>Airplane! (1980)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"bfi-third-party-embed-spotify-container\">\n  <iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"80\" data-src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:2RNHOKb43snjdDerMBIG5O\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</p>\n<p>It may be a comedy but you need to play it straight. That&#8217;s one of the rules Bernstein stuck to for this infamous spoof, writing not only a hilarious straight disaster theme but also a beautiful love theme that suddenly drops the serious side when the angelic chorus breaks out of tune.</p>\n<h3>An American Werewolf in London (1981)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"bfi-third-party-embed-spotify-container\">\n  <iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"80\" data-src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:1E71eTvD1yFA6LQDlu2I9J\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</p>\n<p>Bernstein had collaborated with director John Landis on the cult college comedy Animal House (1978) and they reconvened to make sure this lycanthropic tale was as scary as possible, even with only nine minutes of score. Bernstein would go on to work on the incidental music for Landis\u2019s subsequent horror short, Michael Jackson&#8217;s Thriller (1982).</p>\n<h3>Ghostbusters (1984)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"bfi-third-party-embed-spotify-container\">\n  <iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"80\" data-src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:10aoXnPDx4qhJx6ntOJN7K\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</p>\n<p>While having a big symphonic sound and a wonderful love theme for Sigourney Weaver and Bill Murray, Bernstein otherwise kept to his jazz roots with a jaunty riff that played on the paranormal investigators\u2019 quirky reputation.</p>\n<h3>Far from Heaven (2002)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"bfi-third-party-embed-spotify-container\">\n  <iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"80\" data-src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:6K5TfnrJ05x1KP8iuASFwH\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</p>\n<p>Todd Haynes\u2019 homage to 1950s melodrama master Douglas Sirk is the last picture Bernstein wrote for before his death in 2004. His score is an absolute wonder, full of effervescent emotion to match Edward Lachman&#8217;s wondrous cinematography.</p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n   <link>http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/elmer-bernstein-10-essential-soundtracks</link>\n   <author>Charlie  Brigden</author>\n   <media:content url=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/google_newsstand_1x1/public/news/magnificent-seven-the-1960-002-seven-riders-1000x750.jpg?itok=KncvG8CZ\" type=\"image/jpeg\" expression=\"full\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\">\n    <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Elmer Bernstein: 10 essential soundtracks]]></media:description>\n   </media:content>\n  </item>\n  <item>\n   <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/10-great-missing-person-films</guid>\n   <pubDate>Fri, 09 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\n   <title>10 great missing-person films</title>\n   <description>&lt;div class=&quot;rss-content-container&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Picnic at Hanging Rock to Gone Girl&amp;#8230; as acclaimed Russian drama Loveless arrives in cinemas, we tracked down 10 of the best missing-person mystery movies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</description>\n   <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class=\"rss-content-container\"><p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.49777777778\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/loveless-2017-004-boy-woman-in-kitchen.jpg?itok=osJwXlqX\" alt=\"Loveless (Nelyubov, 2017)\" title=\"Loveless (Nelyubov, 2017)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.49777777778\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/loveless-2017-004-boy-woman-in-kitchen.jpg?itok=osJwXlqX\" alt=\"Loveless (Nelyubov, 2017)\" title=\"Loveless (Nelyubov, 2017)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Loveless (Nelyubov, 2017)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<div class=\"content-information\">\n<p>Loveless is in cinemas from 9 February 2018</p>\n<p>It won the best film award at the 61st BFI London Film Festival</p>\n</div>\n<p>Those unfortunate enough to have a loved one go missing, never to return, often speak of it as a fate worse than death. Loss of life, for all its painful finality, is an ending. It marks a transition that, hopefully over time, can be processed, perhaps even lead to a new beginning, whereas a disappearance is a ceaseless torment of the unknown, the unresolved. For a species of storytellers, looking for understanding and meaning in our personal narratives, a lack of closure goes against everything we stand for. Full stop.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bcf2ddb6c\">Andrey Zvyagintsev</a>\u2019s latest state-of-the-Russian-nation address, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/5a14317f119d8\">Loveless</a>, begins as a barbed Bergmanesque drama. Middle-class Muscovites Boris and Zhenya count down their bitter marriage with endless bouts of mutual loathing.</p>\n<p>The biggest casualty of their marital warfare, however, is their 12-year-old son Alyosha, blameless for being partly the reason for their ill-fated union (Zhenya\u2019s unexpected early pregnancy), yet blamed all the same. Unwanted by both parents, who are each eager for fresh starts with new partners, the boy is either forgotten about when the insults fly, or used as ammunition. Then, after one particularly vicious row, Alyosha flees their cramped flat&#8230;</p>\n<p>Other, more forgiving filmmakers would use this device as the moment where characters\u2019 animosities are put aside, if only temporarily, for the greater (greatest?) good. Zvyagintsev and regular co-writer <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bda9a6ed7\">Oleg Negin</a>, as previous collaborations testify, resist those impulses. And without revealing their end game here, what they\u2019re charting ultimately isn\u2019t just the disappearance of a child, but the erosion in care and empathy of an entire society.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/Online/loveless2018\"><span>Buy tickets for Loveless at BFI Southbank</span></a></li>\n</ul><p>It\u2019s an icily brutal use of a familiar trope in movies, one that can be used for sustained ambiguity or brilliantly resolved climaxes, as ably demonstrated by the films below.</p>\n<h3>The Lady Vanishes (1938)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong> Alfred Hitchcock</span></p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.30543318649\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/lady-vanishes-the-1938-006-dame-may-whitty-michael-redgrave-catherine-lacey-bfi-00m-et7.jpg?itok=nbVmIRrv\" alt=\"The Lady Vanishes (1938)\" title=\"The Lady Vanishes (1938)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.30543318649\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/lady-vanishes-the-1938-006-dame-may-whitty-michael-redgrave-catherine-lacey-bfi-00m-et7.jpg?itok=nbVmIRrv\" alt=\"The Lady Vanishes (1938)\" title=\"The Lady Vanishes (1938)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>In his famous interviews with Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9ee3449d\">Alfred Hitchcock</a> refers to his initial British phase of filmmaking as \u201cthe period of the sensation\u201d and his later US run as \u201cwhen the ideas were fertilised\u201d, thus confirming the popular assumption that the latter is of greater value.

As filming continues we see shots of the camera, even film crew discussions: the simple process of a naturalistic, handheld investigation, now (over-)familiar territory to fans of Michael Moore, Nick Broomfield and others.</p>\n<p>But despite the constant innovation (incorporating stills, voiceover, black rectangles over faces for anonymity), gradually, an uneasy feeling of divergence arises. Not just from the central mystery \u2013 Imamura becomes more interested in a burgeoning relationship between two side characters \u2013 but from the documentary mode itself, which is dismantled in a stunning finale of fourth-wall (actually, here, all four walls) breaking. Finally, you realise Imamura\u2019s authentic quest: to question the very nature and veracity of \u2018cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9\u2019, wherein a man, and a preconception of cinematic realism, vanishes before our eyes.</p>\n<h3>Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong> Peter Weir</span></p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33473389356\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/picnic-at-hanging-rock-1975-004-two-girl-montage.jpg?itok=CVYz8ju2\" alt=\"Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975)\" title=\"Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33473389356\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/picnic-at-hanging-rock-1975-004-two-girl-montage.jpg?itok=CVYz8ju2\" alt=\"Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975)\" title=\"Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>As with L\u2019avventura, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1cd2d9f\">Peter Weir</a>\u2019s harbinger of Australian cinema on a global stage refuses to provide answers for what happens to its missing. In 1900, three teenage schoolgirls, and one teacher, vanish without a trace from their eponymous Valentine\u2019s Day outing. And though one student is eventually found, unable to remember anything of value, Weir, like Antonioni, is more focused on the fallout \u2013 what becomes of those left behind.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b30b703\">film</a> of mood and tone: pristine white Victorian dresses set contrasted against ancient, sun-baked rock that, if you look closely, seems to be impassively watching back. The young women, as much as they represent civilisation and modernity, are ultimately subsumed into nature, and anyone struggling against this is fighting a losing battle. But Weir never forces these points. Instead he keeps the entire film on a delicate, sensory register. The slow motion, swirling montages and ghostly, panpipe-led score at once awaken and suppress a mass hysteria ever simmering below the surface, in a haunting, elusive masterwork.</p>\n<h3>The Vanishing (1988)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong> George Sluizer</span></p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33333333333\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/vanishing-the-1988-003-woman-end-of-tunnel.jpg?itok=fi22OX69\" alt=\"The Vanishing (1988)\" title=\"The Vanishing (1988)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33333333333\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/vanishing-the-1988-003-woman-end-of-tunnel.jpg?itok=fi22OX69\" alt=\"The Vanishing (1988)\" title=\"The Vanishing (1988)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all very well disappearing your characters and constructing an enigma around this central mystery, avoiding narrative closure in favour of more abstract ambitions. Sometimes, however, you need to get down and dirty, finish your story for good or ill. And <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f361d60\">Georges Sluizer</a>\u2019s notorious thriller is all about providing a finite, unambiguous ending.</p>\n<p>First things first. Happy, holidaying Dutch couple Rex and Saskia stop at a service station to refuel. Saskia never returns. Three years later, Rex\u2019s obsessive quest to find her is taken to unprecedented mania, when he starts to receive taunting letters from her abductor Raymonde, an unlikely, mild-mannered family man \u2013 and sociopath. The cat-and-mouse game between the two men, with knowledge as bait and ultimate prize, ratchets up unbearable tension. What lengths would you go to, to learn the truth? And if you know who\u2019s responsible, surely you have the power? <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7995c468\">The Vanishing</a> will test your resolve to have all questions answered: its gravely shocking climax is one you might well beg, in vain, to vanish from your nightmares.</p>\n<h3>Oldboy (2003)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong> Park Chan-wook</span></p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33698030635\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/oldboy-2003-006-man-force-captures-woman.jpg?itok=7h1Mli4e\" alt=\"Oldboy (2003)\" title=\"Oldboy (2003)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33698030635\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/oldboy-2003-006-man-force-captures-woman.jpg?itok=7h1Mli4e\" alt=\"Oldboy (2003)\" title=\"Oldboy (2003)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Most films about missing people chart the efforts of the search party. <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bc7d6ea41\">Park Chan-wook</a>, on the other hand, turns victim into seeker. Without warning, Korean businessman Oh Dae-su (the electrifying <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bbf442486\">Choi Min-sik</a>) is abducted and bundled into a windowless hotel room, where he is kept alive on basic rations with only a TV for company. He spends 15 years climbing the walls \u2013 suicide attempts are foiled by gassing him unconscious \u2013 before suddenly and without warning being freed, and given mere days to figure out who kidnapped him, and why.</p>\n<p>Based on a popular Japanese manga, it\u2019s an irresistible mystery. But, as has oft been detailed, it\u2019s Park\u2019s visceral, bravura telling that puts <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b89f68292\">Oldboy</a> among the most acclaimed and accessible foreign-language films of the century, despite (or possibly, because of?) graphic bursts of taboo-busting violence, both physical and emotional. Without giving away its blindsiding climactic revelation, the film cleverly misdirects us from one missing person case to another; so, ultimately, we\u2019re as complicit and helpless as our protagonist in forgetting past \u2013 and future \u2013 sins.</p>\n<h3>The Dead Girl (2006)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director </strong>Karen Moncrieff</span></p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33690658499\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/dead-girl-the-2006-002-girl--long-shot-public-phone.jpg?itok=zcQa7Qyl\" alt=\"The Dead Girl (2006)\" title=\"The Dead Girl (2006)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33690658499\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/dead-girl-the-2006-002-girl--long-shot-public-phone.jpg?itok=zcQa7Qyl\" alt=\"The Dead Girl (2006)\" title=\"The Dead Girl (2006)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Criminally underseen and overlooked, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bb01f2c2c\">Karen Moncrieff</a>\u2019s quintet of stories circles a young murder victim and the repercussions on various women whose lives are touched by her death. Toni Collette, cowed by an abusive, bed-ridden mother, finds her body; Rose Byrne wants to believe the discovery provides closure on her long-missing sister; Mary Beth Hurt makes a shocking revelation about her husband\u2019s nighttime sorties; Marcia Gay Harden loses, and gains, a family member; and finally, we backtrack to the title character and witness <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bb0a0622f\">Brittany Murphy</a>\u2019s fateful final hours.</p>\n<p>An all-star indie cast (also featuring James Franco, Josh Brolin, Kerry Washington and more) excels, and Moncrieff relentlessly probes the deadening, often internalised damage of male-dominated and sanctioned oppression on her varied female protagonists. One wonders if the <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8c0244c8\">film</a> would resonate more widely in today\u2019s #MeToo climate. Although perhaps even now its intensely bleak journey into darkness might be too raw, made even more poignant by Murphy\u2019s own tragic, premature passing.</p>\n<h3>About Elly (2009)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong> Asghar Farhadi</span></p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/about-elly-2009-001-sepideh-and-elly-behind-bars.jpg?itok=z3Qj6Nfu\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/about-elly-2009-001-sepideh-and-elly-behind-bars.jpg?itok=z3Qj6Nfu\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Many audiences discovered Iranian filmmaker <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bcb63781e\">Asghar Farhadi</a> through his Oscar-winners A Separation (2011) and The Salesman (2016). Yet the preceding feature, his fourth, is just as accomplished and powerful. It&#8217;s another forensic examination of middle-class relationships, deceptions and the bitter costs of preserving honour in a society insistent on the maintenance of outward appearances \u2013 even if that means covering up unexpected disappearances.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8d30890a\">About Elly</a> casts its unerring gaze over a group of well-to-do college pals (plus kids) on a seaside jolly, who have coerced single kindergarten teacher, Elly, along to matchmake her with expat divorc\u00e9 Ahmad. To uphold Iranian social strictures, the group must pretend Elly and Ahmad are married, but when a child nearly drowns and Elly mysteriously vanishes, cracks in their story, assumptions and relationships emerge to devastating effect.</p>\n<p>This is another stunning example of Farhadi\u2019s gift for humanely exposing the gulf between our idealised selves and our actions under pressure, delivered by some of his country\u2019s finest actors, not least A Separation\u2019s Peyman Moaadi, Shahab Hosseini from The Salesman and the mercurial <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bbf60ec85\">Golshifteh Farahani</a>, last seen in Jim Jarmusch\u2019s Paterson (2016).</p>\n<h3>Gone Girl (2014)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong> David Fincher</span></p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.50537634409\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/gone-girl-2014-002-nick-at-microphone-by-missing-poster.jpg?itok=O2O3I5tI\" alt=\"Gone Girl (2014)\" title=\"Gone Girl (2014)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.50537634409\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/gone-girl-2014-002-nick-at-microphone-by-missing-poster.jpg?itok=O2O3I5tI\" alt=\"Gone Girl (2014)\" title=\"Gone Girl (2014)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>This is the best of the recent series of hit \u2018Girl\u2019 literary adaptations (from those with Dragon Tattoos to those on the Train), all flashy, female-framed mysteries of an urban or domestic noir bent.

And even watching it 50 years later, we can hardly rest easy.</p>\n<p>Premiering on 8 February 1968 before US release in April (the same week as that other sci-fi milestone 2001: A Space Odyssey), <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1b2780d\">Franklin J. Schaffner</a>\u2019s provocative allegory led to four sequels, which were no less downbeat. Indeed, it\u2019s difficult to imagine such a grimly apocalyptic movie series existing today. The modern reboots are decidedly less nihilistic.</p>\n<p>For audiences, seeing civilisation as we know it come to an end in the apes movies seemed to have a hypnotic effect. What\u2019s more, the franchise\u2019s commentary \u2013 on America\u2019s interracial conflict, the country\u2019s love-hate of immigrants, its violent protests, clashes between youth and authority, feminism, and (most pressing of all) the impending extinction of the human species in nuclear war \u2013 resonates just as strongly now as it did then.</p>\n<p>When interstellar explorer George Taylor (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1653b24\">Charlton Heston</a>) crash lands on a seemingly barren planet and is captured by gorillas that kill his fellow astronauts, he realises he has entered a world where evolution has seemingly gone backwards: apes govern and humans are subordinate.

It ends in a frenzy of machine gun fire, with Brent and Taylor mown down, and even the mute flower-child Nova (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba29c85c0\">Linda Harrison</a>) shot dead by the rampaging gorilla army.</p>\n<p>The third entry in the series seemed to take a lighter tone in comparison, but even this proves to be deceiving.

There they are treated like celebrities by the media until the authorities begin to realise the implications of Zira\u2019s becoming pregnant. The two chimpanzees are forced into exile as the military tries to hunt them down before they can trigger the end of human civilisation.</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33636363636\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/escape-from-the-planet-of-the-apes-1971-001-kim-hunter-roddy-mc-dowall.jpg?itok=iubx1HZv\" alt=\"Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971)\" title=\"Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33636363636\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/escape-from-the-planet-of-the-apes-1971-001-kim-hunter-roddy-mc-dowall.jpg?itok=iubx1HZv\" alt=\"Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971)\" title=\"Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>The film resonates as an allegory on migration in America: Cornelius and Zira are ultimately viewed as illegal immigrants and a threat to the American way. Escape also had much to say about the then-burgeoning second-wave feminist movement: Zira emerges as a strong, intelligent and politicised female who puts the males around her to shame.

When Wilder and Lemmon worked together, their strongest films brought darkness and delight to the screen with sophistication, humour and a biting satirical edge. This is their masterpiece, a wry comment on the vicious world of corporate America, but with an ending as romantic and beautiful as Hollywood ever mustered.</p>\n<h3>Days of Wine and Roses (1962)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong>\u00a0Blake Edwards</span></p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33576642336\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/days-of-wine-and-roses-1962-001-jack-lemmon-lee-remick.jpg?itok=8To8jfWQ\" alt=\"Days of Wine and Roses (1962)\" title=\"Days of Wine and Roses (1962)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33576642336\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/days-of-wine-and-roses-1962-001-jack-lemmon-lee-remick.jpg?itok=8To8jfWQ\" alt=\"Days of Wine and Roses (1962)\" title=\"Days of Wine and Roses (1962)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Lemmon and co-star <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f3b9230\">Lee Remick</a> both earned Oscar nominations for their compelling performances in <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9ef42358\">Blake Edwards</a>\u2019 startling depiction of a couple falling through a downward spiral of alcoholism and addiction.

When producer David O. Selznick tapped Victor Fleming to helm Gone with the Wind (1939), Vidor took over directing duties on The Wizard of Oz (1939). Refusing to take any credit for the favour, Vidor was responsible for the sepia-tinted Kansas scenes (including \u2018Somewhere over the Rainbow\u2019).</p>\n<p><div class=\"image half right\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.772700644405\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/half/public/image/king-vidor-portrait-bfi-00m-hpt.jpg?itok=fLAV13l5\" alt=\"King Vidor with the National Film Theatre 10th anniversary programme in his hands\" title=\"King Vidor with the National Film Theatre 10th anniversary programme in his hands\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"0.772700644405\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/half/public/image/king-vidor-portrait-bfi-00m-hpt.jpg?itok=fLAV13l5\" alt=\"King Vidor with the National Film Theatre 10th anniversary programme in his hands\" title=\"King Vidor with the National Film Theatre 10th anniversary programme in his hands\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">King Vidor with the National Film Theatre 10th anniversary programme in his hands</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Born in 1894, the Texan filmmaker had started making movies before he turned 20, growing up in parallel to his chosen medium. If he\u2019s not spoken of in the same hallowed tones as many of his contemporaries, such as John Ford or Howard Hawks, there\u2019s little mistaking Vidor as anything but an auteur. He may have considered himself a conservative \u2013 especially as he got older \u2013 but his films served to interrogate the political and philosophical systems they superficially championed.</p>\n<p>If the men in Vidor\u2019s cinema largely succeed in their pursuit of the American dream, it\u2019s his women that finally emerge as the most fascinating figures, even if they\u2019re rarely victorious against the stacked decks of life and its systems.</p>\n<h3>The Big Parade (1925)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.30076558513\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/big-parade-the-1925-001-soldier-war-00n-19y.jpg?itok=RmypapKo\" alt=\"The Big Parade (1925)\" title=\"The Big Parade (1925)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.30076558513\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/big-parade-the-1925-001-soldier-war-00n-19y.jpg?itok=RmypapKo\" alt=\"The Big Parade (1925)\" title=\"The Big Parade (1925)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>With more than 20 features and almost as many shorts already under his belt, Vidor graduated to the majors with what would be one of the great commercial successes of the silent era. Still one of the defining films about the Great War, The Big Parade serves as the director\u2019s grandest statement on the effects of forces beyond an individual\u2019s control. The build-up to war plays out as unhurried pastoral, before two of Vidor\u2019s greatest set-pieces: the lovers\u2019 operatic goodbye and a drumbeat-scored forest march into the mouth of hell.</p>\n<h3>The Crowd (1928)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33345808383\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/crowd-the-1928-001-james-murray-eleanor-boardman-estelle-clark-bert-roach-slide-coney-island-bfi-00n-99n.jpg?itok=0MaFkqmC\" alt=\"The Crowd (1928)\" title=\"The Crowd (1928)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33345808383\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/crowd-the-1928-001-james-murray-eleanor-boardman-estelle-clark-bert-roach-slide-coney-island-bfi-00n-99n.jpg?itok=0MaFkqmC\" alt=\"The Crowd (1928)\" title=\"The Crowd (1928)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>A shattering indictment of the American dream, Vidor\u2019s silent masterpiece was the director\u2019s favourite among his own films. Where later pictures would champion the rewards of a strong work ethic, The Crowd sees a series of cruel indignities heaped upon its life-worn everyman, with momentary wins undercut by tragedy. Expressionist flourishes make way for earthy realism, influencing filmmakers from Vittorio De Sica (who half-inched the ending for 1952\u2019s Umberto D.), to Billy Wilder, who would borrow the film\u2019s famous office shot for The Apartment (1960).</p>\n<h3>Show People (1928)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33407988055\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/show-people-1928-002-marion-davies-william-haines-bfi-00n-noj.jpg?itok=uU65pnVn\" alt=\"Show People (1928)\" title=\"Show People (1928)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33407988055\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/show-people-1928-002-marion-davies-william-haines-bfi-00n-noj.jpg?itok=uU65pnVn\" alt=\"Show People (1928)\" title=\"Show People (1928)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>While she\u2019s perhaps best remembered as the mistress of gazillionaire newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst (and the unfair target of Orson Welles in Citizen Kane), Marion Davies was a brilliant comic talent, amply demonstrated in the three films she made for King Vidor. Show People, Vidor\u2019s last silent, is the best of three, a delightfully meta behind-the-silver-screen romp that charts the graduation of Georgian belle Peggy Pepper from slapstick bit-player to Patricia Pepoire, dramatic star. The Big Parade\u2019s John Gilbert, Charlie Chaplin and Vidor all cameo as themselves, but the broadest meta-lol sees Peggy spot a certain \u201cMarion Davies\u201d on the studio lot.</p>\n<h3>Hallelujah (1929)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.3340832396\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/hallelujah-1929-013-king-curly-nina-mae-mckinney-embrace-bfi-00o-7mr.jpg?itok=GYvOH7_R\" alt=\"Hallelujah (1929)\" title=\"Hallelujah (1929)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.3340832396\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/hallelujah-1929-013-king-curly-nina-mae-mckinney-embrace-bfi-00o-7mr.jpg?itok=GYvOH7_R\" alt=\"Hallelujah (1929)\" title=\"Hallelujah (1929)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Vidor\u2019s first sound film, and the first major studio picture to feature an all-black cast, Hallelujah serves up a potent mix of religious and sexual fervour. A quasi-musical, shot on location in the deep south, its issues with post-synced dialogue all but disappear in the trade-off for Vidor\u2019s mastery of the roving camera. Charges of exoticism may be a little harder to ignore, but there\u2019s real empathy and complexity here, not least in the astonishing Nina Mae McKinney\u2019s Chick, the first of many Vidor women who refuse to be inhibited in their sexual agency and desires.</p>\n<h3>Our Daily Bread (1934)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33712121212\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/our-daily-bread-1934-001-group-worshipping.jpg?itok=3N7OwTzE\" alt=\"Our Daily Bread (1934)\" title=\"Our Daily Bread (1934)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33712121212\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/our-daily-bread-1934-001-group-worshipping.jpg?itok=3N7OwTzE\" alt=\"Our Daily Bread (1934)\" title=\"Our Daily Bread (1934)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Despite being well into the talkie era by 1934, Vidor cast an eye back to the silents for what might just be his greatest set-piece. The finale of Our Daily Bread \u2013 a cautious experiment in collectivist thinking made at the height of the Depression \u2013 sees an irrigation channel dug from water source to crop, with all hands on deck for a bravura, wordless sequence. If the ending demonstrates Vidor\u2019s mastery of montage, the film as a whole showed a willingness to re-examine his philosophy of individualism within the context of a system more necessarily radical.</p>\n<h3>Stella Dallas (1937)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33408833522\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/stella-dallas-1937-001-anne-shirley-barbara-stanwyck-bfi-00n-31g.jpg?itok=s11qKL7M\" alt=\"Stella Dallas (1937)\" title=\"Stella Dallas (1937)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33408833522\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/stella-dallas-1937-001-anne-shirley-barbara-stanwyck-bfi-00n-31g.jpg?itok=s11qKL7M\" alt=\"Stella Dallas (1937)\" title=\"Stella Dallas (1937)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Barbara Stanwyck took home the Oscar for her eponymous lead in Vidor\u2019s terrific adaptation of Olive Higgins Prouty\u2019s novel, as did Anne Shirley for her supporting turn as Stella\u2019s daughter. Stanwyck\u2019s is a remarkably unsentimental performance in a remarkably unsentimental film, one that tackles questions of class and social mobility within the genre framework of the \u2018woman\u2019s picture\u2019. It\u2019s an exceptional example by virtue of both Vidor and Stanwyck\u2019s willingness to portray Stella as an unsympathetic figure for much of the film, albeit one \u2013 as so often with Vidor \u2013 heroically unconstrained by the shackles of conformity and compromise.</p>\n<h3>An American Romance (1944)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33333333333\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/american-romance-an-1944-001-workman-bfi-00n-l7d.jpg?itok=LjG97ZCL\" alt=\"An American Romance (1944)\" title=\"An American Romance (1944)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33333333333\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/american-romance-an-1944-001-workman-bfi-00n-l7d.jpg?itok=LjG97ZCL\" alt=\"An American Romance (1944)\" title=\"An American Romance (1944)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s readily apparent in the version currently available that An American Romance was subject to studio interference. Though shorn of 20-odd minutes, the film remains recognisable as a Vidor passion project, a large-scale encapsulation of the director\u2019s thematic ideals. Brian Donlevy stars as the immigrant steel worker who rises to industrial tycoon. He may be no Spencer Tracy (Vidor\u2019s first choice), but his unrelenting wilfulness proves hard to resist, despite the film\u2019s simplistic trajectory. Benefiting from a sizeable budget, the mill accident set-piece that sees the protagonist hemmed in by a river of molten steel is a doozy.</p>\n<h3>The Fountainhead (1949)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33421052632\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/fountainhead-the-1949-001-gary-cooper-patricia-neal-bfi-00m-xgt.jpg?itok=NMHAXWht\" alt=\"The Fountainhead (1949)\" title=\"The Fountainhead (1949)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33421052632\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/fountainhead-the-1949-001-gary-cooper-patricia-neal-bfi-00m-xgt.jpg?itok=NMHAXWht\" alt=\"The Fountainhead (1949)\" title=\"The Fountainhead (1949)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Vidor may have done little to temper novelist Ayn Rand\u2019s sledgehammer subtlety, attacking the material with an appropriately scaled production design that matched her uncompromising vision of full-bore capitalist enterprise and individualism. The phallocentric undertones certainly weren\u2019t lost on him either \u2013 especially in the film\u2019s final shot \u2013 as architect Howard Roark (Gary Cooper) and his opponents fret and clash over the size and integrity of their erections. If The Fountainhead\u2019s ideology belongs to Rand, then its erotic charge (via Patricia Neal) is all Vidor, and it\u2019s in the unresolved tension between the two that the film is at its most fascinating.</p>\n<h3>Beyond the Forest (1949)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33363108531\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/beyond-the-forest-1949-001-bette-davis-hat-drink-bfi-00o-80s-cropped-4x3.jpg?itok=HGaHC5i7\" alt=\"Beyond the Forest (1949)\" title=\"Beyond the Forest (1949)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33363108531\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/beyond-the-forest-1949-001-bette-davis-hat-drink-bfi-00o-80s-cropped-4x3.jpg?itok=HGaHC5i7\" alt=\"Beyond the Forest (1949)\" title=\"Beyond the Forest (1949)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Ignore the less-than-stellar reputation, Vidor\u2019s spectacularly lurid noir is sensational. It was Beyond the Forest\u2019s star, Bette Davis, who led the way in trash-talking what was to be her last film for Warner Bros, a contractual obligation that she did everything she could to extricate herself from. The studio weren\u2019t having it, and the resulting performance \u2013 dripping with poison \u2013 only served to amplify Vidor\u2019s nihilistic theme of the individual clawing at the expectations of dull convention. Murder, illicit affairs and a violent attempt at miscarriage, all served up by an imperious, snarling Davis under Vidor\u2019s magnificently over-the-top hand.</p>\n<h3>Ruby Gentry (1952)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33791748527\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/ruby-gentry-1952-001-jennifer-jones.jpg?itok=FjTyGe96\" alt=\"Ruby Gentry (1952)\" title=\"Ruby Gentry (1952)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33791748527\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/ruby-gentry-1952-001-jennifer-jones.jpg?itok=FjTyGe96\" alt=\"Ruby Gentry (1952)\" title=\"Ruby Gentry (1952)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Given Vidor\u2019s first film with Jennifer Jones \u2013 psychosexual western Duel in the Sun (1946) \u2013 was famously commandeered by producer David O.

The thrill of giving in to pleasure and pain. The danger of putting your trust completely in the hands of someone else. Exploring the limits of sexual desire may seem reckless to some \u2013 terrifying even. However, there is no doubt when you look at the success of <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/54da92d1d85a6\">E.L. James</a>\u2019 Fifty Shades of Grey, both the books and film adaptations, BDSM is a hugely popular subject.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/54da92d191870\">Fifty Shades of Grey</a> (2015), directed by <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bbe0f29e5\">Sam Taylor-Johnson</a>, follows the same line as its literary predecessor, focusing on the trials and tribulations of Anastasia Steele (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bc546fd64\">Dakota Johnson</a>), a virginal young woman who finds herself in a sadomasochistic relationship with billionaire Christian Grey (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bd8b69de4\">Jamie Dornan</a>). Through her dealings with Grey, Anastasia experiences a sexual awakening, ultimately learning where her limits lie. This becomes one of the main themes of the entire series.</p>\n<p>In honour of the release of Fifty Shades Freed, the third and final part of the saga, here are five other films about BDSM, currently available on <a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk\">BFI Player</a>, to whet the appetite further. Each one provides the perfect jumping off point for those who want to delve into the darker corners of eroticism and fantasy in cinema.</p>\n<h3>Express to pain and pleasure\u2026 Trans-Europ-Express (1966)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/trans-europ-express-1966-002-woman-chains.jpg?itok=l2ZZNCLu\" alt=\"Trans-Europ-Express (1966)\" title=\"Trans-Europ-Express (1966)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/trans-europ-express-1966-002-woman-chains.jpg?itok=l2ZZNCLu\" alt=\"Trans-Europ-Express (1966)\" title=\"Trans-Europ-Express (1966)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that filmmaker, novelist and artist <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f1cbb1c\">Alain Robbe-Grillet</a> and his wife Catherine lived out their lives together as master and slave.

It\u2019s also something of a cosmic cousin to Pasquale Festa Campanile\u2019s The Slave (1969) and Rainer Werner Fassbinder\u2019s The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant (1972) in that it focuses entirely on women, and most importantly their desire, within the confines of a mistress/slave dynamic.</p>\n<p>The relationship between the two main protagonists, Cynthia (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bbef8b7de\">Sidse Babett Knudsen</a>) and Evelyn (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/50c309fdb65c6\">Chiara D&#8217;Anna</a>), plays out on a highly charged sexual playing field, where very little remains off limits. Men are never mentioned, with Strickland creating a universe owned entirely by women.</p>\n<p>The film opens up the discussion of power play in sadomasochistic relationships, quashing misconceptions surrounding the nature of dominance and submission. Strickland also places a strong emphasis on concepts such as love, friendship and intimacy, making the film not just highly erotic, but richly emotional too.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-the-duke-of-burgundy-2014-online\">Watch The Duke of Burgundy online on BFI Player</a></li>\n</ul><h3>Master and servant\u2026 The Chambermaid Lynn (2014)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/chambermaid-lynn-the-2014-001-two-characters-sandwiching-cushion-ORIGINAL.jpg?itok=deseoQTL\" alt=\"The Chambermaid Lynn (2014)\" title=\"The Chambermaid Lynn (2014)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/chambermaid-lynn-the-2014-001-two-characters-sandwiching-cushion-ORIGINAL.jpg?itok=deseoQTL\" alt=\"The Chambermaid Lynn (2014)\" title=\"The Chambermaid Lynn (2014)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bd28752e5\">Ingo Haeb</a>\u2019s lead character in <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/56f0a83c9d1d8\">The Chambermaid Lynn</a>\u00a0isn\u2019t so different to Fifty Shades\u2019 Anastasia, in that both protagonists are young women who experiment with BDSM as a way of opening up avenues of desire in order to awaken their sexuality.</p>\n<p>The similarities stop there. Haeb\u2019s film comes up with some very different messages about the nature of romance and sadomasochistic desire.</p>\n<p>When we first meet the titular Lynn, she is a lonely character who works constantly, seemingly compelled to serve others. She spies on the hotel guests, trying on their clothes and hiding under their beds so that she may be privy to their most intimate moments.</p>\n<p>This ends when she encounters a dominatrix prostitute (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bd686cb50\">Lena Lauzemis</a>) and decides to hire the woman to explore some of her own fantasies. Although Haeb is careful to never signpost the feelings of either character, master or slave, what we can take away is Lynn\u2019s eventual transformation.</p>\n<p>In this way The Chambermaid Lynn owes a debt to films such as Pasquale Festa Campanile\u2019s The Libertine (1968) or Catherine Breillat\u2019s Romance (1999), where young women are able to find an emotional connection, and eventual liberation, through sadomasochism.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-the-chambermaid-lynn-2014-online\">Watch The Chambermaid Lynn online on BFI Player</a></li>\n</ul></div>]]></content:encoded>\n   <link>http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/fifty-shades-darker-bdsm-film</link>\n   <author>Kat  Ellinger</author>\n   <media:content url=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/google_newsstand_1x1/public/news/fifty-shades-freed-2018-dakota-johnson-sunbed-sunglasses-1000x750.jpg?itok=BO7fhPwr\" type=\"image/jpeg\" expression=\"full\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\">\n    <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Fifty shades darker yet: five boundary-pushing films about pleasure and pain]]></media:description>\n   </media:content>\n  </item>\n  <item>\n   <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">news-opinion/news-bfi/features/male-critics-female-friendships-film</guid>\n   <pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\n   <title>Male critics, female friendships on film</title>\n   <description>&lt;div class=&quot;rss-content-container&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small wonder that films about female friendships have traditionally fared so poorly with critics, argues Christina Newland.

And at a time when they\u2019re being showcased, it\u2019s worth noting how lukewarm the critical reception for many of these films was at the time of release.</p>\n<p>Regardless of genre or directorial star power, middling to negative reviews from largely male critics confined many movie \u2018girlfriends\u2019 to a narrowly defined audience of middle-aged women or teenage girls.</p>\n<p>In retrospect, reappraisals of these films have revealed vibrant, well-observed portrayals of women\u2019s relationships, with underappreciated performances therein. Stars such as <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f5bd290\">Karen Black</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1bd9a1a\">Barbra Streisand</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba0d48cc1\">Dolly Parton</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1518dae\">Jane Fonda</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba18e5e8e\">Bette Midler</a> sparkle in these sorts of roles, often carrying flawed films on their shoulders through force of character.</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5808\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/nine-to-five-1980-001-lily-tomlin-dolly-parton-jane-fonda.jpg?itok=5dWGjok6\" alt=\"Nine to Five (1980)\" title=\"Nine to Five (1980)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5808\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/nine-to-five-1980-001-lily-tomlin-dolly-parton-jane-fonda.jpg?itok=5dWGjok6\" alt=\"Nine to Five (1980)\" title=\"Nine to Five (1980)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Nine to Five (1980)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f4d6a54\">Dorothy Arzner</a> \u2013 the only woman director at work in Hollywood during the 1930s \u2013 made her 1940 film <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6a855d80\">Dance Girl Dance</a>, she had already completed more than a dozen features. Her work rate, while astounding by today\u2019s standards, matched the regular working schedule of the factory-line (male) studio director, proof both of Arzner\u2019s industriousness and her power within a system so unfriendly to women.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s strange that in Bosley Crowther\u2019s New York Times review of Dance Girl Dance, he makes absolutely zero mention of Arzner. While panning the film as predictable and flimsy, he attributes fault to the RKO producer <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9fa2e0ce\">Erich Pommer</a>, unwilling to even afford Arzner the dignity of her own apparent filmmaking failure. It\u2019s fair to say that in the Hollywood of old, producers had more name recognition \u2013 and power \u2013 than directors. But to fail to mention the director in a review of her own film seems nonetheless suspect. Even as early as 1940, Crowther, veteran film critic that he was, must have been aware that certain filmmakers were distinctive and worth discussing. Reviews of other films from that year show that he breathlessly praised directors such as Leo McCarey and Alfred Hitchcock. So what gives?</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been true for most of film history: if a woman makes a film, a man reviews it. The people in the press most often given the task of evaluating artwork \u2013 even if it is deeply and inextricably female in its making and intent \u2013 have overwhelmingly been male. Although much has changed since 1940, many of us are still talking about the same things \u2013 and the gender disparity between mainstream film critics remains notable.</p>\n<p>Reporting from Sundance Film Festival this year, Buzzfeed film critic Allison Wilmore noted the wide variety of female-led films there, including The Tale, a harrowing account of a young teenage girl\u2019s sexual abuse. Yet a notable member of male establishment media at Variety disdainfully called it a \u201cLifetime movie\u201d, referring to the American cable channel targeted at women. Wilmore summarises perfectly when she writes: \u201cFemininity is treated as a sign [of things which are] lightweight, disposable, and lacking in artistic substance.\u201d</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.53672532517\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/steel-magnolias-1989-001-olympia-dukakis-shirley-maclaine-bfi-00o-d6k.jpg?itok=X5Kozs7I\" alt=\"Steel Magnolias (1989)\" title=\"Steel Magnolias (1989)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.53672532517\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/steel-magnolias-1989-001-olympia-dukakis-shirley-maclaine-bfi-00o-d6k.jpg?itok=X5Kozs7I\" alt=\"Steel Magnolias (1989)\" title=\"Steel Magnolias (1989)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Steel Magnolias (1989)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this is a long-held critical tradition, where dismissive attitudes and thinly-veiled disdain permeate reviews of female-led work. <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7996a22e\">Steel Magnolias</a> (1989), a warm southern tale of small-town women and the vicissitudes of their lives, was critically savaged at the time of its release. Its OTT southern belle style and teary-eyed sentiment seemed to specifically annoy male reviewers. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019ve been airlifted onto some horrible planet of female impersonators,\u201d Hal Hinson quipped in his Washington Post review of the film. Vincent Canby literally echoes the same idea in his own review at the New York Times \u2013 as if the traditional femininity of the women on screen is somehow grotesque. \u201cAre we supposed to laugh with these women, or at them?\u201d he writes.</p>\n<p>The derision toward \u2018chick flicks\u2019 or films that heavily featured female friendship seemed particularly fierce in the 1980s. When <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b79c78cdb\">Beaches</a> (1988) \u2013 a weepie about a lifelong friendship between two opposites-attract pals (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba16516f3\">Barbara Hershey</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba18e5e8e\">Bette Midler</a>) \u2013 was released, the response was pitiless. Yet when NYT critic Janet Maslin was tasked with reviewing some of the same subject matter, she offers an even-keeled, thoughtful approach. Beaches may have been imperfect, but Maslin notes: \u201cAs opposites, C.C. and Hillary do make an appealing if pat combination. [&#8230;] Together, they make the friendship convincing and the story a lot more interesting than it otherwise would be.\u201d</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.50444444444\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/beaches-1988-001-barbara-hershey-bette-midler-beach.jpg?itok=jJ4JWeic\" alt=\"Beaches (1988)\" title=\"Beaches (1988)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.50444444444\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/beaches-1988-001-barbara-hershey-bette-midler-beach.jpg?itok=jJ4JWeic\" alt=\"Beaches (1988)\" title=\"Beaches (1988)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Beaches (1988)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>In spite of the strength and insight of powerful women critics like Maslin, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba16248dc\">Molly Haskell</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba16f1089\">Pauline Kael</a>, who reigned at the New Yorker through the 1960s and 70s, this condescending tone remained in place for far too long.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba0d48cc1\">Dolly Parton</a> had her breakout role in <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6e13a94a\">Nine to Five</a> (1980), a male writer for the Toronto Globe <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span> Mail said: \u201cShe is a sweet little thing, but no thespian.\u201d Like many of us, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba2634e92\">Roger Ebert</a> thought Parton was a natural film star. But for some male figures, the brassy blonde was out of her depth in the serious business of cinema. In the NYT, Canby wrote that Parton performs \u201cwith a modesty that doesn&#8217;t quite match her figure\u201d.\u00a0Nine to Five, a comedy with serious feminist overtones about workplace harassment, was apparently too ambitious for the \u201csweet little thing\u201d.</p>\n<p>Even when beloved male auteurs turned their attention to female friendship, their films were often not spared. When it comes to women, objectification is more common than nuance. In Howard Hawks\u2019 classic <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6aaf1d6a\">Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</a> (1953), the gold-digging comedy-musical sees its two showgirls turns men into ineffable fools. But a Time magazine reviewer misses the subtext in order to celebrate what he calls \u201cthe three-dimensional attractions of its two leading ladies\u201d.</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5368531103\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/come-back-to-the-five-and-dime-jimmy-dean-jimmy-dean-1982-001-four-women-smiling-facing-forward-in-cafe.jpg?itok=4CqbbDLy\" alt=\"Come Back to the 5 &amp;amp; Dime Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (1982)\" title=\"Come Back to the 5 &amp;amp; Dime Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (1982)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5368531103\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/come-back-to-the-five-and-dime-jimmy-dean-jimmy-dean-1982-001-four-women-smiling-facing-forward-in-cafe.jpg?itok=4CqbbDLy\" alt=\"Come Back to the 5 &amp;amp; Dime Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (1982)\" title=\"Come Back to the 5 &amp;amp; Dime Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (1982)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Come Back to the 5 & Dime Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (1982)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Unbelievably, the same kind of ogling seemed par for the course decades later, as reviews of Robert Altman\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7032726a\">Come Back to the 5 <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span> Dime Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean</a> (1983) crow about <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9efa780d\">Cher</a>\u2019s breasts rather than acknowledging the empathetic viewpoint Altman takes on her insecure obsession with her own body.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, these days, there are greater numbers of female critics at work, and just as importantly, women-led programming initiatives that celebrate works that were once dismissed and ignored.

Indeed, were it not for a couple of indulgent producers swayed by his reputation as a stage director, he might never have had the opportunity to forge his international reputation with <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b668f52\">Summer with Monika</a> (1953).</p>\n<p>That bittersweet adaptation of a Per Anders Fogelstr\u00f6m novel came almost a decade after Bergman (who was then working in the script department at Svensk Filmindustri) had produced the screenplay for Alf Sj\u00f6berg&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6ac3c382\">Torment</a> (1944), an anti-fascist allegory that allowed Bergman to exorcise some of the demons of his own unhappy youth.</p>\n<p>As he sometimes struggled to find funding for his own projects, Bergman would continue to write for other directors, such as <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f4a0e19\">Gustaf Molander</a> (Woman without a Face; Eva) and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f62673c\">Lars-Eric Kjellgren</a> (While the City Sleeps). He also remained a man of the theatre, with residencies in Helsingborg and Gothenburg persuading sceptical backers to follow up his debut feature, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6ae4eeee\">Crisis</a> (1946).</p>\n<p>Indeed, when producer Lorens Marmstedt called to offer Bergman work, he joked that Crisis was \u201can awful film\u201d and that it was \u201chard to imagine anything worse\u201d. But the resulting poetic realism of <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6bce3cc6\">It Rains on Our Love</a> (1946) and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b61ddea\">A Ship Bound for India</a> (1947) prompted critic Andr\u00e9 Bazin to laud him for creating \u201ca world of blinding cinematic purity\u201d.</p>\n<p>Likewise, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1c57f9e\">Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut</a> was quick to commend <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b8b55ae\">Thirst</a> (1949) and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6ae56b89\">Waiting Women</a> (1952), comparing the former to Hitchcock and the latter to Joseph L. Mankiewicz&#8217;s A Letter to Three Wives (1949).</p>\n<p>Certainly, the influence of film noir was strong on Bergman&#8217;s pessimistic existentialism, as was the neo-realism of Roberto Rossellini. But the social climate in postwar Sweden also had a considerable impact on his evolving style, as the combination of secularism and permissiveness enabled him to tackle adult themes with a degree of gravitas.</p>\n<p>Here are five early Bergman gems that reveal his distinctive voice emerging.</p>\n<h3>Crisis (1946)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33379888268\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/crisis-1946-001-inga-landgre-stig-olin.jpg?itok=LVXhGp4q\" alt=\"Crisis (1946)\" title=\"Crisis (1946)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33379888268\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/crisis-1946-001-inga-landgre-stig-olin.jpg?itok=LVXhGp4q\" alt=\"Crisis (1946)\" title=\"Crisis (1946)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Bergman\u2019s debut as director is a town-and-country saga centring on the relationship between an ing\u00e9nue (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba390d6d4\">Inga Landgr\u00e9</a>) and her biological (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba556203b\">Marianne L\u00f6fgren</a>) and foster (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba4b0b67e\">Dagny Lind</a>) mothers.

He introduced screenings of his last feature <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/563d346aeb6b7\">Cemetery of Splendour</a> by stating that he didn\u2019t mind people sleeping during them; and said the same (more understandably) ahead of the <a href=\"/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/features/perchance-dream-long-night-apichatpong-shorts\">16-hour, 36 film all-night Tate Modern retrospective of his work</a> that took place a year later. This fascination with screen-slumber meets its logical endpoint at this year\u2019s International Film Festival Rotterdam, where the director has created <a href=\"https://iffr.com/en/2018/films/sleepcinemahotel\">SLEEPCINEMAHOTEL</a>, a site-specific temporary space \u2013 half-hotel, half-installation \u2013 where guests dream beneath an enormous projection screen.</p>\n<div class=\"content-information\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sleepcinemahotel.com\">SLEEPCINEMAHOTEL</a> ran\u00a025\u201329 January 2018 in the Postillion Convention Centre, Rotterdam as part of the <a href=\"https://iffr.com/en/2018/films/sleepcinemahotel\">International Film Festival Rotterdam</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Inside, a cluster of beds suspended at varying heights \u2013 connected by a grid of elaborate scaffolding \u2013 form a canopy of nests. Arranged in a crescent, each bed faces towards the circular screen at the room\u2019s end, mounted against the window so that the city lights flicker lambently behind it. Archive film, collected from a century of cinema and selected for its tranquility is projected silently and continuously, with the sound of tides overlain, lapping on a loop. In every nest, a bed and bed-side table with lamp, and various amenities including towels, slippers and a bottle of SLEEPCINEMAWATER. It\u2019s a marvellous construction, <a href=\"https://www.sleepcinemahotel.com\">inspired</a> by an image from Sergei Eisenstein\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b7271d6\">Strike</a> (1925) where workers sit atop scaffold towers, their bodies carving shapely silhouettes against the geometric frames.</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/sleepcinemahotel-2018-003-scaffolding-screen-coast.jpg?itok=zhLfgiF1\" alt=\"SLEEPCINEMAHOTEL\" title=\"SLEEPCINEMAHOTEL\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/sleepcinemahotel-2018-003-scaffolding-screen-coast.jpg?itok=zhLfgiF1\" alt=\"SLEEPCINEMAHOTEL\" title=\"SLEEPCINEMAHOTEL\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>          <span class=\"copy\">Credit: Matt Turner</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Arriving after midnight, I settle down and start scribbling what I see and think. There\u2019s no indication of the rules for this space. It\u2019s a hostel, with shared sleeping arrangements and presumed conviviality; but also a cinema, with a focal point and the expectation of silence. Interpretations vary over what both of these environments mean separately, but by conflating them, presumably a new meaning is produced? I think about the hotel room seen in one of Apichatpong\u2019s short films, <a href=\"http://www.kickthemachine.com/page80/page22/page64/index.html\">Emerald</a> (2008), a serene, silent space, haunted by floating particles (or are they feathers?) and friendly spectres; or the room in <a href=\"http://www.kickthemachine.com/page80/page1/page19/index.html\">M Hotel</a> (2011), a paradisal zone where two men take pictures of each other, playfully posing with pillows, safe and alone together.</p>\n<p>I think also about his more recent projects such as <a href=\"http://www.kickthemachine.com/page80/page22/page33/index.html\">Fireworks (Archives)</a> (2014), where the projection occupies more than the screen, sending ghostly flickers dancing around the gallery space, illuminating dark corners and casting shadows over those in the room; or <a href=\"http://www.kickthemachine.com/page80/page34/page59/index.html\">Fever Room</a> (2016-), a project pushing further beyond the container of the frame, part performance, part projection, part three-dimensional light show. Is this room I\u2019m in \u2013 where the viewers are part of the performance in a way, shadow-silhouettes cutting sleep-shapes in front of projected backdrops \u2013 an extension of these ideas? Is it an attempt to redefine what theatrical space might look like, or just a nice place to kip? Both, I suppose.</p>\n<p>The screened sequences \u2013 none of which repeat across the installation\u2019s five-day run \u2013 are unified by their serenity, a reverie of intoxicating miscellany. Much of the imagery I witness is images of nature, landscapes or aquatic scenes: trips through canals, rivers or oceans, scenes featuring sailors and steamboats, or simple stretches of endless, lulling waves, the effect of which is unsurprisingly hynotic. In between, a windmill, the underside of a blimp, two nuns folding clothes, light aircraft, a clock, a city seen from above, boys pillow-fighting, girls playing, many facial closeups, lots of people sleeping. At one point, an astounding sequence shows catamarans floating between blue triangle islands, at which my notes read: \u201cthis is SLEEPCINEMA, this is bliss.\u201d I\u2019m not sure what i mean, but I obviously feel something.</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/sleepcinemahotel-2018-002-beach-sea-crowd.jpg?itok=Ujh_Kdw3\" alt=\"SLEEPCINEMAHOTEL\" title=\"SLEEPCINEMAHOTEL\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/sleepcinemahotel-2018-002-beach-sea-crowd.jpg?itok=Ujh_Kdw3\" alt=\"SLEEPCINEMAHOTEL\" title=\"SLEEPCINEMAHOTEL\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>          <span class=\"copy\">Credit: Matt Turner</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Most of the footage is black-and-white or blue-tinted, but some is in colour, gentle green or yellow hues, mostly from sunsets or foliage. Around 2am, a series of scenes of particular beauty arrive, images of patterns of light cast over various objects. These shimmering visions, some of the most abstract imagery seen so far, could be from a <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bb34ad578\">Nathaniel Dorsky</a> film. It makes me wonder about the authors of all these images, and of the role of the curator in creating dialogues and dissonances; but also what it means to curate at scale like this, and with such specific, soporific purpose? Maybe soon we will have dream curators?</p>\n<p>At the next cut, a shot of clouds breaking over a landscape recalls <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba01b3e84\">Peter Hutton</a>. Then some striking closeups that are very <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba147eb0f\">Carl Theodor Dreyer</a> in composition; and cycles of flowers in bloom that look like lost <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bbc6e249a\">Mary Field</a> films. Is this sublime passage my reward for staying awake this long?</p>\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://film.list.co.uk/article/98818-apichatpong-weerasethakul-at-gsff-i-encourage-the-organiser-to-bring-some-beds-and-the-audiences-to-bring-pillows-and-sheets/\">interview</a> about these overnight projections, Apichatpong said that \u201cin the night, one doesn\u2019t need to interpret meanings but let the image and sound flow like a river. You cannot control it, just marvel,\u201d and, as per, I\u2019m guilty of thinking too much. It\u2019s past 3am. I fill up my bottle. Is it still SLEEPCINEMAWATER if you replace it with tap water? How much should I watch? Is it strange that I\u2019m seeking excitement from something designed to be somnolent? Would I be doing the experience a better service by letting sleep arrive, or is it revealing that I want to stay awake to absorb more?</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/sleepcinemahotel-2018-004-man-boat.jpg?itok=0uEMC9Oo\" alt=\"SLEEPCINEMAHOTEL\" title=\"SLEEPCINEMAHOTEL\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/sleepcinemahotel-2018-004-man-boat.jpg?itok=0uEMC9Oo\" alt=\"SLEEPCINEMAHOTEL\" title=\"SLEEPCINEMAHOTEL\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>          <span class=\"copy\">Credit: Matt Turner</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>It is as these questions and others drift through my overactive subconscious that I fall into slumber. I awake often, each time to a new radiant plane of circular scenery, and each time having forgotten where I am, or even what I am. In half-sleep, the coruscating orb is not actually recognisable as a projection, but instead seems to be more like a portal, offering wondrous reflections of cinema\u2019s past and the planet\u2019s global present.</p>\n<p>It turns out that I have a rapidly advancing viral infection, and my thoughts and dreams are more literally feverish than Apichatpong had perhaps intended. My body radiates hot and cold and my mind moves phantasmagorically through all manner of imagined scenarios both improbable and utterly mundane. I want to climb inside the circle, its glow beckons me.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I crawl out of bed, scrawl the most delirious nonsense (sorry, Joe!) in the notebook left for guests to describe their experience, and stumble out in the cold streets of Rotterdam. I try to watch other things, but I\u2019m stuck in what the SLEEPCINEMAHOTEL <a href=\"https://www.sleepcinemahotel.com\">literature</a> describes as Apichatpong&#8217;s \u201cpreferred plane of existence\u201d. Either that or it&#8217;s the fever at work. I check into my next hotel, pass out and dream about the dreams I had before.</p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n   <link>http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/comment/festivals/sleepcinemahotel-apichatpong-weerasethakul-rotterdam</link>\n   <author>Matt  Turner</author>\n   <media:content url=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/google_newsstand_1x1/public/news/sleepcinemahotel-2018-001-scaffolding-screen-holding-hands-CROP.jpg?itok=sDADuqYs\" type=\"image/jpeg\" expression=\"full\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\">\n    <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[SLEEPCINEMAHOTEL: Apichatpong curates our dreams in Rotterdam]]></media:description>\n   </media:content>\n  </item>\n  <item>\n   <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/ida-lupino-director</guid>\n   <pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\n   <title>How Ida Lupino lit a path for women directors and indie filmmakers alike</title>\n   <description>&lt;div class=&quot;rss-content-container&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no place for women directors in 1940s and 50s Hollywood, but that didn&amp;#8217;t stop Ida Lupino.

The setup is all detail: a gun, a number-plate, a spilled purse and the killer\u2019s shoes. Largely confined to the vehicle hosting a pair of vacationing buddies and the psychopath they pick up, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6ac67ce6\">The Hitch-Hiker</a> ekes tremendous tension from the nervous scrutiny of Lupino\u2019s close-ups.</p>\n<p>The desert wasteland outside serves as a pitiless counterpoint to the interior claustrophobics, while <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba251141d\">William Talman</a> \u2013 and his malfunctioning eyelid \u2013 delivers one the great screen wackos. Running a mere 71 minutes, there\u2019s not an ounce of fat on The Hitch-Hiker.

Parting ways, the production company went wholly independent, self-distributing <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6a5024d4\">The Bigamist</a> at profit-crippling expense.</p>\n<p>Alongside <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba151a808\">Joan Fontaine</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f4241f1\">Edmond O\u2019Brien</a>, Lupino took a starring role, despite promising never to do so (\u201cI can\u2019t afford my salary\u201d), thereby becoming the first woman to direct herself in a major feature. The controversial subject matter saw Lupino return to The Filmakers\u2019 originally stated ethos, fittingly for what would prove to be her final picture for the company.

In fact, with only seven features to her name, the 60-plus episodes of TV she directed make up the vast majority of her body of work behind the camera. Her ability to work quickly and to budget clearly proved a bankable asset, and series as disparate as Alfred Hitchcock Presents, The Fugitive and Gilligan\u2019s Island would follow.</p>\n<p>The only woman to direct <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7abc888f\">an episode</a> of The Twilight Zone in its entire 156-episode run, Lupino\u2019s viciously grotesque miniature would prove one of the show\u2019s late highlights.

Of course, he did much more, as the various brilliant roles of actors including <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f7adcf0\">Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9eecc4b4\">Erland Jospehson</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1bf17ba\">Max Von Sydow</a> attest to; but time and again, Bergman explored with supreme insight his female characters\u2019 joy and suffering, loves and losses, most heartfelt desires and deepest fears.</p>\n<div class=\"content-information\">\n<p><a href=\"/ingmar-bergman\">Ingmar Bergman</a>, a comprehensive season of the Swedish auteur\u2019s work to celebrate his centenary, runs at BFI Southbank January\u2013March 2018.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Inspired by his theatrical, repertory company background, the roll call of great actresses, many appearing repeatedly, astonishes: from early stars like Maj-Britt Nelson and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f791a98\">Eva Dahlbeck</a>, through to <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f6851ea\">Gunnel Lindblom</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f6d19b6\">Ingrid Thulin</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f684ef5\">Harriet</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f6298a4\">Bibi Andersson</a> (no relation), <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1c6ac4b\">Liv Ullmann</a> and more. Bergman could be frustratingly fickle. In the same book, Bergman on Bergman, he admits his \u201ccompulsive\u2026 ceaseless fascination\u201d with women, then contradicts himself by bullishly claiming, \u201cI draw no special distinction between male and female. I\u2019ve no decided view of women.\u201d Yet in Images, he writes openly of film work\u2019s \u201cpowerfully erotic business\u2026 the atmosphere is irresistibly charged with sexuality.\u201d</p>\n<p>His chaotic love life, including affairs with some of his leading ladies, often shows him in a poor light. In terms of working relationships, however, it\u2019s rare to hear criticism from either side. Bergman, though often using the image of an \u201cinstrument\u201d to describe his performers (clearly requiring a virtuoso player, i.e. himself), is effusive in his admiration. Thulin is \u201cmagnificent\u201d; Dahlbeck \u201cincomparable\u201d; Harriet Andersson \u201cone of cinema\u2019s geniuses\u201d. Even his namesake, Ingrid, with whom he struggled terribly to achieve her final (superb) big screen performance in <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6bc1b101\">Autumn Sonata</a>, he remembers as \u201cgenerous, grand, and highly talented\u201d.</p>\n<p>The question of whether Bergman is a \u2018feminist\u2019 filmmaker has long been debated. <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1590eae\">Jean-Luc Godard</a> famously wrote that, \u201cBergman alone knows how to film men as women love yet hate them, and women as men hate yet love them.\u201d And while he often clearly shows, in his comedies as much as his searing psychological dramas, how women are defined, contained and condemned by an unforgiving patriarchal society, the focus is usually internalised, the gaze often ambivalent.</p>\n<p>As the same existential crises occur over and over in Bergman\u2019s characters, this video essay is interested in a sort of polyphonic approach \u2013 as if the women in multiple films, across various decades, can somehow merge, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b2deaa5\">Persona</a>-like, and commune. Yes, all these performances and characters were shaped and guided by the man who wrote and directed them. But there\u2019s also a strong sense that the women, and actresses, we see on these screens were ultimately able to transcend such strictures: to become the light and life force illuminating Ingmar Bergman\u2019s beloved magic lanterns.</p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n   <link>http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/video/women-ingmar-bergman-actresses-essay</link>\n   <author>Leigh  Singer</author>\n   <media:content url=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/google_newsstand_1x1/public/news/women-on-a-bergman-screen-video-essay-001-boy-hand-over-projected-women_1000x750.jpg?itok=RK1OxFnp\" type=\"image/jpeg\" expression=\"full\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\">\n    <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Women on a Bergman screen \u2013 a video essay]]></media:description>\n   </media:content>\n  </item>\n  <item>\n   <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/10-great-war-films-21st-century</guid>\n   <pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\n   <title>10 great war films of the 21st century</title>\n   <description>&lt;div class=&quot;rss-content-container&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;From The Hurt Locker to Dunkirk, modern war movies are often immersive sensory experiences.

Sheriff</a>\u2019s enduring 1928 stage play about British soldiers in the trenches in northern France towards the end of the First World War.

From 2001\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b861b71b9\">Black Hawk Down</a> to last year\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/59ba6364cc8c8\">Dunkirk</a>, Hollywood in particular has recoiled from the notion of the war movie as sombre morality tale, instead fixating on allowing audiences to experience the nightmarish sensory overload of life on the frontlines for themselves.</p>\n<p>This approach has been informed to a degree by the video game industry. The last decade has seen Activision\u2019s Call of Duty series, which specialises in intensely kinetic interactive renderings of wars both real and imagined, emerge as one of the most lucrative properties in entertainment history.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve also seen a proliferation of films grappling with murky contemporaneous conflicts like the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the consequences and traumas of which are still being processed by society at large. The most successful of these, like Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8bf3c780\">The Hurt Locker</a> (2008), have refrained from making sweeping political statements, and instead sought to make sense of the chaos by exploring the psyches of individuals caught in the crossfire.</p>\n<p>Here are 10 recent films that point to a bright future for a genre burdened with the responsibility of making sense of our past.</p>\n<h3>Black Book (2006)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong> Paul Verhoeven</span></p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33333333333\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/black-book-2006-002-bitten-woman-in-water.jpg?itok=dUQxZRMr\" alt=\"Black Book (2006)\" title=\"Black Book (2006)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33333333333\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/black-book-2006-002-bitten-woman-in-water.jpg?itok=dUQxZRMr\" alt=\"Black Book (2006)\" title=\"Black Book (2006)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1c90e98\">Paul Verhoeven</a>\u2019s predictably provocative <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8b1d5a3f\">evocation</a> of the Nazi-occupied Netherlands may appear at first glance to be little more than a salacious pot-boiler, but beneath its lurid surface lurks a multifaceted exploration of war\u2019s debilitating and dehumanising effects.</p>\n<p>Verhoeven\u2019s flair for blockbuster bombastics powers this rip-roaring tale of Jewish singer Rachel Stein (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bc8f9352d\">Carice van Houten</a>), whose place of refuge is blown to smithereens in the opening minutes. Joining forces with the Dutch resistance, she\u2019s tasked with infiltrating the regional Gestapo headquarters by seducing SD head Ludwig M\u00fcntze (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2baa7da4b0\">Sebastian Koch</a>). Needless to say this doesn\u2019t go entirely to plan, but a boatload of narrative twists ensures a far-from-predictable ride.</p>\n<p>Van Houten delivers a star-making turn as a woman left with no choice but to weaponise her sexuality, who is promptly vilified in all quarters for doing so. And in reliably subversive fashion, Verhoeven undercuts his superficially happy ending with a positively chilling final image.</p>\n<h3>Letters from Iwo Jima (2006)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director\u00a0</strong>Clint Eastwood</span></p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33898305085\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/letters-from-iwo-jima-2006-002-soldier.jpg?itok=qjEinRhL\" alt=\"Letters from Iwo Jima (2006)\" title=\"Letters from Iwo Jima (2006)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33898305085\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/letters-from-iwo-jima-2006-002-soldier.jpg?itok=qjEinRhL\" alt=\"Letters from Iwo Jima (2006)\" title=\"Letters from Iwo Jima (2006)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>In a recent Guardian article entitled \u2018In the line of dire: let\u2019s call time on Clint Eastwood\u2019s macho movies\u2019, the grizzled Hollywood veteran stands accused of repeatedly trotting out the same old \u201cstory of stoic, white, militaristic American masculinity saving the day\u201d. Yet the piece neglects to acknowledge <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba14a21b4\">Eastwood</a>\u2019s most ambitious modern offering as a director, which might also be the most even-handed <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8bf4bf6f\">portrayal of war</a> committed to film \u2013 two epic features, shot back-to-back, exploring 1945\u2019s battle of Iwo Jima from opposing perspectives.</p>\n<p>The American portion, Flags of our Fathers, does a solid job of skewering gung-ho jingoism by itself, dismantling the heroic myth of the men depicted in Joe Rosenthal\u2019s iconic photo of the flag-raising on Iwo Jima. But the notion of war as a black-and-white affair is positively eviscerated by its elegant companion piece, which hones in on a group of undernourished, undersupplied Japanese soldiers as they anxiously await a battle they have next-to-no hope of surviving.</p>\n<p>Dominating proceedings is <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba7628610\">Ken Watanabe</a> as Kuribayashi, a brilliant general harboring deeply conflicted views about the country he serves.</p>\n<h3>Waltz with Bashir (2008)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong>\u00a0Ari Folman</span></p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.32696390658\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/waltz-with-bashir-2008-001-israeli-soldiers-in-sea.jpg?itok=VW0cMsZH\" alt=\"Waltz with Bashir (2008)\" title=\"Waltz with Bashir (2008)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.32696390658\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/waltz-with-bashir-2008-001-israeli-soldiers-in-sea.jpg?itok=VW0cMsZH\" alt=\"Waltz with Bashir (2008)\" title=\"Waltz with Bashir (2008)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>While many modern filmmakers rail against the notion of war as a noble pursuit by striving for harrowing gritty realism, Israeli documentarian <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/54653bc78d473\">Ari Folman</a> swam against the tide in singular fashion when it came to tackling his own experiences as a soldier in the 1982 Lebanon war. Taking as its starting point an encounter with a friend in 2006 in which Folman realises he\u2019s repressed most of his memories of the period, the filmmaker embarks on a journey to flesh out the fragments he still recalls.</p>\n<p>His simple masterstroke was to convey this entire process through highly stylised animation, elegantly weaving together a patchwork quilt of fragmentary recollections, dreams and hallucinations. The result is a thrillingly <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8cab71fc\">intimate account</a> of processing trauma, which also highlights the futility of attempting to boil a war down to a series of immutable facts and moral lessons.</p>\n<h3>The Hurt Locker (2008)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong>\u00a0Kathryn Bigelow</span></p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33366683342\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/hurt-locker-the-2008-001-explosion.jpg?itok=bzhD9ZFB\" alt=\"The Hurt Locker (2008)\" title=\"The Hurt Locker (2008)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33366683342\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/hurt-locker-the-2008-001-explosion.jpg?itok=bzhD9ZFB\" alt=\"The Hurt Locker (2008)\" title=\"The Hurt Locker (2008)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>The only war film this century to be crowned best picture at the Oscars is also the only film made by a woman to ever win the Academy\u2019s top accolade. <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba586a070\">Kathryn Bigelow</a>\u2019s laser-focused portrait of a US bomb disposal unit\u2019s tour of duty in Iraq has been harshly criticised on numerous fronts \u2013 for its technical inaccuracies, its apolitical stance, and the fact that Bigelow broke through one of Hollywood\u2019s glass ceilings by delivering a film without any discernible trace of femininity.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, The Hurt Locker remains a troublingly compelling exploration of war\u2019s addictive qualities. In its most bombastic moments, it\u2019s about as close as cinema has come to replicating the dizzying, immersive thrill of playing Call of Duty. But for the most part, it trades in slow-burning, stomach-churning tension, with Jeremy Renner mesmerising as a compulsive risk-taker who seems to recoil at being labelled as such.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-the-hurt-locker-2008-online\">Watch The Hurt Locker online on BFI Player</a></li>\n</ul><h3>City of Life and Death (2009)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong>\u00a0Lu\u00a0Chuan</span></p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33619456366\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/city-of-life-and-death-2009-001-covered-eyes-women-4x3.jpg?itok=DFJKzuuG\" alt=\"City of Life and Death (2009)\" title=\"City of Life and Death (2009)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33619456366\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/city-of-life-and-death-2009-001-covered-eyes-women-4x3.jpg?itok=DFJKzuuG\" alt=\"City of Life and Death (2009)\" title=\"City of Life and Death (2009)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>The Nanjing (formerly Nanking) massacre, a six-week period of mass rape and murder committed in 1937 by Japanese soldiers against Chinese civilians during the second Sino-Japanese war, remains to this day a major impediment to relations between the two countries. The massacre remained relatively unknown in the west until the publication of Iris Chang\u2019s 1997 book The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II, which in turn inspired a number of films on the subject.</p>\n<p>The most impactful of these is this unflinching <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8d27dac0\">dramatisation</a> by Chinese auteur <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bcca42d8d\">Lu Chuan</a>, which offers little in the way of background and context. It\u2019s at once intimate and epic, cutting restlessly between uncomfortable close-ups and overwhelming widescreen crowd shots, with lush black-and-white photography adding a welcome layer of hyperreality.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Lu\u2019s laudably level-headed approach ensures that the perpetrators never feel like cartoonish monsters. Indeed, the director received death threats from some Chinese viewers for his sympathetic treatment of the Japanese soldier Kadokawa (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bc7a35a7f\">Hideo Nakaizumi</a>).\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Inglourious Basterds (2009)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Director</strong> Quentin Tarantino</span></p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/inglourious-basterds-2009-christoph-waltz-smoking-pipe-00o-27h.jpg?itok=Ugj8P0ps\" alt=\"Inglourious Basterds (2009)\" title=\"Inglourious Basterds (2009)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/inglourious-basterds-2009-christoph-waltz-smoking-pipe-00o-27h.jpg?itok=Ugj8P0ps\" alt=\"Inglourious Basterds (2009)\" title=\"Inglourious Basterds (2009)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Fuelled by its creator\u2019s unwavering belief in the power of film (more specifically, in his own films) to change the world, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8d1e06d1\">Inglourious Basterds</a> is the most gleefully irreverent depiction of the Third Reich this side of Ilsa: She Wolf of the SS (1975). On paper, it looked like <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba9d8e6e4\">Quentin Tarantino</a> might be succumbing to all his most childish impulses, with <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba8d9afe7\">Brad Pitt</a> hamming it up as a hillbilly lieutenant leading a crack squad of Jewish-American soldiers on a bloody rampage through Nazi-occupied France.</p>\n<p>But far from being the orgy of naval-gazing Nazisploitation many feared, the film, for the most part, sees Tarantino playing to his greatest strength \u2013 his flair for crafting unbearably tense, darkly comic, dialogue-driven set pieces. And, of course, the filmmaker was slyly hiding an ace up his sleeve \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba432f0a4\">Christoph Waltz</a>, whose revelatory turn as demonically charming SS colonel Hans Landa catapulted an obscure fiftysomething Austrian TV actor to Oscar glory and a lucrative career as Hollywood\u2019s effete European villain of choice.\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Restrepo (2010)</h3>\n<p><span class=\"content-small-print-text\"><strong>Directors</strong> Tim Hetherington and Sebastian Junger</span></p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33414295628\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/restrepo-2010-003-rifle-shooting-4x3.jpg?itok=2SOu86Qu\" alt=\"Restrepo (2010)\" title=\"Restrepo (2010)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33414295628\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/restrepo-2010-003-rifle-shooting-4x3.jpg?itok=2SOu86Qu\" alt=\"Restrepo (2010)\" title=\"Restrepo (2010)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>In 2007, American journalist and author <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bbe24ec24\">Sebastian Junger</a> and British photojournalist <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bd0d5726d\">Tim Hetherington</a> were commissioned by Vanity Fair to profile a platoon of US soldiers stationed in Afghanistan\u2019s Korengal Valley, regarded at the time as the most dangerous spot in the country.</p>\n<p>While contending with challenges like a lack of running water and constant enemy gunfire, the pair took the assignment as an opportunity to try their hand at filmmaking for the first time, ultimately making a total of 10 trips to the valley over the course of a year, and shooting around 150 hours of footage.</p>\n<p>In condensing this down to a slick 93 minutes, the pair delivered a <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8dc0b46d\">scintillating primer</a> in modern warfare, encompassing the boredom, the transgressive excitement, the abject terror and the lingering trauma.

Even the words alone \u2013 avant-garde, experimental \u2013 can conjure the image of beard-stroking cinephiles gawping at split-screen installations.</p>\n<p>Yet the work of <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f64490c\">Kenneth Anger</a> \u2013 the intrepid underground filmmaker who\u2019s rubbed shoulders with everyone from Mick Jagger and Jean Cocteau to sexologist Alfred Kinsey and Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey \u2013 soon dispels the stereotype. His work grabs you by the throat \u2013 with confrontational flashes of swastikas and skulls, and gay orgies lighting up the screen. He blends the iconography of evil with references to pop culture and male sexuality.</p>\n<p>To watch these movies is to feel as though you\u2019ve stumbled upon the secret recordings of an underground cult. They\u2019re daring, dangerous, and you can\u2019t tear your eyes away from them.</p>\n<p>\u2028Anger \u2013 also famed for his notorious Hollywood Babylon books, in which he laid bare the sordid scandals of Hollywood \u2013 dabbled with the occult frequently (although he now insists he\u2019s not a Satanist). He famously had \u2018Lucifer\u2019 branded across his chest, and littered his films with references to paganism and Nazism. All of which adds to the sense of danger and mystery that surrounds his movies.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://shop.bfi.org.uk/magick-lantern-cycle-dvd-bluray.html#.Wm8ZHJOFiUM\">Buy our Kenneth Anger boxset on Blu-ray and DVD</a></li>\n</ul><h3>The best place to start \u2013 Scorpio Rising</h3>\n<p><div class=\"image half right\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33410138249\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/half/public/image/scorpio-rising-1963-001-man-with-cigarette-close-up.jpg?itok=HgM9CfCk\" alt=\"Scorpio Rising (1963)\" title=\"Scorpio Rising (1963)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33410138249\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/half/public/image/scorpio-rising-1963-001-man-with-cigarette-close-up.jpg?itok=HgM9CfCk\" alt=\"Scorpio Rising (1963)\" title=\"Scorpio Rising (1963)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Scorpio Rising (1963)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>This 1963 homoerotic short about a <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f91860b\">James Dean</a> obsessive in a motorcycle gang is only 28 minutes long. Though it contains zero dialogue, it\u2019s his most celebrated and arguably most accessible work. In it, a leather-clad greaser cleans his bike, oily parts strewn across the floor, cigarette hanging from his lips. Then skull ornaments and skull rings appear among his shrine to Dean. Then flashes of swastikas, scorpions and \u2013 most ominously \u2013 a noose. Have we entered the lair of a serial killer? \u2028</p>\n<p>What makes the scene even more unsettling is the use of doo-wop hits \u2013 not least Bobby Vinton\u2019s haunting ballad \u2018Blue Velvet\u2019, the use of which is said to have influenced a certain David Lynch movie. It\u2019s thrown into the mix with a rapid succession of images: Hitler, Marlon Brando, a low-budget biblical movie. Suddenly you\u2019re faced with a ritualistic orgy of bare-chested bikers. One is held down as mustard is poured on his belly; another takes out his penis. Are we observing the rituals of an underworld cult? Whatever it is, it feels dark and thrilling.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b53e6c0\">Scorpio Rising</a> also serves as the perfect intro to themes that run throughout his work: sadomasochism, the occult, male beauty, violence.</p>\n<h3>What to watch next</h3>\n<p><div class=\"image half right\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33333333333\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/half/public/image/fireworks-1947-001-sailor-holding-man-in-his-arms-bfi-00o-0vp.jpg?itok=i1M9en9l\" alt=\"Fireworks (1947)\" title=\"Fireworks (1947)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33333333333\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/half/public/image/fireworks-1947-001-sailor-holding-man-in-his-arms-bfi-00o-0vp.jpg?itok=i1M9en9l\" alt=\"Fireworks (1947)\" title=\"Fireworks (1947)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Fireworks (1947)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Anger had already cemented his reputation as a cinematic outlaw 16 years before Scorpio Rising. Way back in 1947 he made <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6aa2de87\">Fireworks</a>, a short filmed at his parents\u2019 house in Beverly Hills (while they were away one weekend, of course). It\u2019s a daring \u201cdream of a dream\u201d, according to Anger. \u2018Daring\u2019 because it featured a gay gang-rape fantasy, a Roman candle exploding from a guy\u2019s crotch, and Anger himself being brutally beaten by a group of sailors with chains.</p>\n<p>Again there are sadomasochistic elements, close-ups of the naked male torso, and a strong whiff of the occult. He sums it up as: \u201cAll I have to say about being 17, the United States Navy, American Christmas, and the Fourth of July.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2028Anger\u2019s visual flare in Fireworks \u2013 not worlds apart from Salvador Dal\u00ed and Luis Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s collaborations Un chien andalou (1929) and L\u2019Age d\u2019or (1930) \u2013 didn\u2019t go unnoticed by <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba139a2d5\">Jean Cocteau</a>, with whom he became friends. Unfortunately, it was also spotted by the powers that be, and Anger was arrested on obscenity charges following the film\u2019s release.</p>\n<p>Two other early works to squeeze into this starter pack are 1949\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b75d4bd5d\">Puce Moment</a> \u2013 Anger\u2019s six-minute first foray into colour \u2013 and 1950\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b73d18059\">Rabbit\u2019s Moon</a>, a blue-tinted throwback to the silent era. The former is a plotless love letter to the great goddesses of the studio system, in which vintage sequined dresses are shaken in front of the lens like curtains to unveil a starlet whom we see holding a bunch of greyhounds (as you do). The latter short \u2013 filmed using borrowed sets from <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f4584d4\">Jean-Pierre Melville</a> \u2013 features another doo-wop-heavy soundtrack and centres on a clown called Pierrot who longs for the moon.</p>\n<p>Against the grim backdrop of 1969 \u2013 specifically the Manson murders and the Rolling Stones\u2019 infamous Altamont concert \u2013 Anger delivered the suitably dark head-scratcher that is <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6ad3f0ec\">Invocation of My Demon Brother</a>. Partly filmed on Haight Street in San Francisco \u2013 ground zero for countercultural experimentation \u2013 it features appearances from Anger, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9ef67749\">Mick Jagger</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bad089ec2\">Bobby Beausoleil</a> (who would later join the Manson family and become a convicted murderer).</p>\n<p><div class=\"image half right\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33374033374\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/half/public/image/lucifer-rising-1972-001-egyptian-goddess-summons-angel-bfi-00o-0vo.jpg?itok=Qk1iI8Ix\" alt=\"Lucifer Rising (1972)\" title=\"Lucifer Rising (1972)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33374033374\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/half/public/image/lucifer-rising-1972-001-egyptian-goddess-summons-angel-bfi-00o-0vo.jpg?itok=Qk1iI8Ix\" alt=\"Lucifer Rising (1972)\" title=\"Lucifer Rising (1972)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Lucifer Rising (1972)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Over the film\u2019s 10 minutes, a naked man appears holding a knife against his skin; we see flashes of Hell\u2019s Angels and swastikas (again); and we see Beausoleil take a hit from a skull bong. Floating atop these images is Jagger\u2019s synth score, a dissonant and repetitive whirr with an overwhelming narcotic effect. Oh, and it also features a Satanic funeral ceremony for a pet cat.</p>\n<p>Completed in 1972 after 10 years in the making, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b73cc7518\">Lucifer Rising</a> is perhaps Anger\u2019s most ambitious effort to date. Like a Cecil B. DeMille biblical epic put through the blender with a pinch of paganism, it touches on the story of Lucifer, the fallen angel who rebelled against God. It was inspired by <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bb07b1083\">Aleister Crowley</a>\u2019s poem \u2018Hymn to Lucifer\u2019 and, as with all Anger films, it\u2019s not so straightforward. Suffice to say, it ends with a flying saucer hovering over ancient Egypt. \u2028\u2028</p>\n<p>The filmmaker \u2013 who shot this mini epic in Egypt, Germany and at Stonehenge \u2013 again enlisted famous friends. Along for the ride were <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba0ab2ba9\">Marianne Faithfull</a>, filmmaker <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f8c700f\">Donald Cammell</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bb03d3323\">Jimmy Page</a> (who also scored the movie, though it was scrapped by Anger after the pair fell out) and Beausoleil. In the end it was Beausoleil\u2019s score, written and recorded from prison, that tied the final film together.</p>\n<p>The most interesting tale tied to the movie? Early on, Beausoleil and Anger had a falling out and Beausoleil split with footage from the film. He gave it to his friend Charles Manson, who\u2019s rumored to have buried it in the desert and demanded $10,000 for its return. Anger didn\u2019t pay up.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://shop.bfi.org.uk/magick-lantern-cycle-dvd-bluray.html#.Wm8ZHJOFiUM\">Buy our Kenneth Anger boxset on Blu-ray and DVD</a></li>\n</ul><p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.334\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/inauguration-of-pleasure-dome-1954-001-womans-head-inside-cage-bfi-00o-0vd.jpg?itok=99rpm6Hk\" alt=\"Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (1954)\" title=\"Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (1954)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.334\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/inauguration-of-pleasure-dome-1954-001-womans-head-inside-cage-bfi-00o-0vd.jpg?itok=99rpm6Hk\" alt=\"Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (1954)\" title=\"Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (1954)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (1954)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<h3>Where not to start</h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re not one to dive in at the deep end, then maybe don\u2019t start with 1954\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6ad0cd03\">Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome</a>. It\u2019s 40 minutes of layered images, in which footage of the hell sequence from the 1911 Italian silent film <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7086383f\">L&#8217;inferno</a> is intercut with characters with giant eyelashes, who appear as if plucked from a classical painting. It builds and builds. Suddenly there\u2019s a volcanic explosion of distorted images accompanied by a thunderously operatic soundtrack. It\u2019s beautiful, mind-melting stuff, and probably Anger\u2019s most demanding work.</p>\n<p>In his own words: \u201cThe film is derived from one of Aleister Crowley&#8217;s dramatic rituals where people in the cult assume the identity of a god or a goddess. I wanted to create a feeling of being carried into a world of wonder.\u201d Naturally the film was a huge hit with 60s acidheads.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-anger-me-2006-online\">Watch Anger Me, a documentary about Kenneth Anger, online on BFI Player</a></li>\n</ul></div>]]></content:encoded>\n   <link>http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/where-begin-kenneth-anger</link>\n   <author>Oliver  Lunn</author>\n   <media:content url=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/google_newsstand_1x1/public/news/inauguration-of-pleasure-dome-1954-001-womans-head-inside-cage-bfi-00o-0vd-1000x750.jpg?itok=G7y5JjMv\" type=\"image/jpeg\" expression=\"full\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\">\n    <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Where to begin with Kenneth Anger]]></media:description>\n   </media:content>\n  </item>\n  <item>\n   <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">news-opinion/news-bfi/features/ringu-hideo-nakata-videotapes-lynch-haneke</guid>\n   <pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\n   <title>When videotapes were sinister \u2013 20 years of J-horror classic Ring</title>\n   <description>&lt;div class=&quot;rss-content-container&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analogue anxiety\u2026 With J-horror milestone Ring turning 20, we press rewind to the era when filmmakers from David Lynch to Michael Haneke found everyday terror in the humble VHS.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</description>\n   <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class=\"rss-content-container\"><p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.86046511628\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/ring-1998-woman-crawling-out-of-tv-002_0.jpg?itok=wiV3CqDm\" alt=\"Ring (1998)\" title=\"Ring (1998)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.86046511628\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/ring-1998-woman-crawling-out-of-tv-002_0.jpg?itok=wiV3CqDm\" alt=\"Ring (1998)\" title=\"Ring (1998)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Ring (1998)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bc4014879\">Hideo Nakata</a>\u2019s 1998 J-horror <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b831d23ae\">Ring</a> terrified audiences through the ingenious conceit of a mysterious videotape that, upon being watched by a character, somehow causes them to die a week later.</p>\n<p>Revisiting the film 20 years later, it\u2019s striking just how archaic the now virtually defunct technology videotape already looks to a contemporary audience, and this sense of remoteness brings into focus its distinct properties that tap into certain innate fears of ours.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something about the physical characteristics of a VHS, for instance, that are tactile in a way that the technologies that superseded it aren\u2019t. Whereas formats like DVD (which was on its way to superseding its analogue rival as the new market leader when Ring was released in 1998) and streaming operate in the more ethereal realm of digital data, the bulky shape of the VHS, and the coiled, fragile tape visible within, all ground it as a more tangible part of the material world.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why the signature moment in Ring, when the long-haired girl literally breaks the fourth wall by stepping out from the television, is so terrifying. The analogue physicality of videotape makes the fear that its contents could slip into the material world feel all the more potent.</p>\n<p>Ring is far from being the only film to cast videotape as a menacing object. It features regularly in the films of <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba160c911\">Michael Haneke</a>, as a morbid preoccupation in <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7bd9ea55\">Benny&#8217;s Video</a> (1992), the very form of Funny Games (2007) (in which the antagonists have the power to \u2018rewind\u2019 the film with a remote control) and as a source of harassment in <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8b17e6c2\">Hidden</a>\u00a0(2005).</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/hidden-2005-002-daniel-auteil-julliet-binoche-videocam-footage-on-tv-00o-9qm.jpg?itok=_Yy8AtJt\" alt=\"Hidden (2005)\" title=\"Hidden (2005)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/hidden-2005-002-daniel-auteil-julliet-binoche-videocam-footage-on-tv-00o-9qm.jpg?itok=_Yy8AtJt\" alt=\"Hidden (2005)\" title=\"Hidden (2005)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Hidden (2005)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>This latter example ties videotape with another of Haneke\u2019s recurring themes, the fear of home invasion, as a couple\u2019s comfortable bourgeois existence is disrupted by a series of tapes left on their doorstep containing nondescript yet disquieting footage of their home\u2019s exterior. He was presumably influenced by <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1844422\">David Lynch</a>\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7ed49278\">Lost Highway</a>\u00a0(1997), in which another couple receive anonymous videotapes, only this time featuring footage harrowingly filmed from within their house.</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/lost-highway-1997-fred-madison-with-video-camera-003.png?itok=StQdzS9b\" alt=\"Lost Highway (1997)\" title=\"Lost Highway (1997)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/lost-highway-1997-fred-madison-with-video-camera-003.png?itok=StQdzS9b\" alt=\"Lost Highway (1997)\" title=\"Lost Highway (1997)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Lost Highway (1997)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Both these films express an anxiety about the presence of video inside the domestic space, perhaps relating to how, as a medium that transposes the mystical experience of film viewership away from the public sphere of the cinema into the more mundane realm of our own homes, it threatens to bring something unnatural and potentially dangerous into our private lives.</p>\n<p>Still more fearful than receiving and watching certain videotapes is the act of being recorded onto one. It\u2019s well known how some cultures believe that being photographed results in the theft of one\u2019s soul, and there is indeed something discomfitingly violating about being recorded on camera.</p>\n<p>The advent of accessible and affordable camcorders (like the one used in Lost Highway) brought such technology into our homes, providing another way in which intimacy can be intruded upon, as in <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b79904532\">sex, lies, and videotape</a>\u00a0(1989), where James Spader\u2019s character records home videos of him interviewing women about their sex lives.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In that film, something about the presence of a video camera draws out candid responses from the characters being recorded. Although videotapes are, curiously, rarely used as a means to expose the truth in crime thrillers and whodunits (villains are instead far more likely to be caught out by incriminating audio recordings), the prying eye of the video recorder instead elicits emotional truths, whether that be a character\u2019s sexuality in sex, lies, and videotape, or deeply repressed guilt in Hidden and Lost Highway.</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/sex-lies-and-videotape-1989-andie-mcdowell-with-video-camera-001.jpg?itok=-6a_pW-L\" alt=\"sex, lies, and videotape (1989)\" title=\"sex, lies, and videotape (1989)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.77777777778\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/sex-lies-and-videotape-1989-andie-mcdowell-with-video-camera-001.jpg?itok=-6a_pW-L\" alt=\"sex, lies, and videotape (1989)\" title=\"sex, lies, and videotape (1989)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">sex, lies, and videotape (1989)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Above all, what makes videotape such an evocative subject is its association with the taboo. As reflected in films fondly depicting video store culture \u2013 such as Scream (1996), where characters stockpile R-rated horror flicks, and Clerks (1994), where a shop assistant jokes about the ubiquity of pornography \u2013 VHS tapes were often equated to obscene content, to the extent that a moral panic followed the rise of the new technology in the 1980s.</p>\n<p>Debate broke out in Britain regarding whether particularly lurid \u2018video nasties\u2019 were corrupting the public and ought to be more strictly censored. And anxious Hollywood figures further muddied the technology\u2019s reputation by arguing that using VCRs to record film footage onto videotape was tantamount to theft, with MPAA president Jack Valenti notoriously going so far as to liken its threat to the movie industry to that of \u201cthe Boston strangler\u2026 to the woman home alone\u201d.</p>\n<p>Leave it to the visionary <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9ef42c58\">David Cronenberg</a> to conjure what is perhaps the definitive study of a technology that both attracts and repels us. Released in 1983, his masterpiece <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b69593482\">Videodrome</a> tapped into topical anxieties about the dangers of consuming videotape footage, through a story about a man whose sense of reality disintegrates when he is brainwashed by mysterious television signals and videotapes broadcasting particularly violent and sexually explicit material.</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.49750415973\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/videodrome-1982-001-television-snog-00n-ktx.jpg?itok=OrBT90M9\" alt=\"Videodrome (1983)\" title=\"Videodrome (1983)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.49750415973\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/videodrome-1982-001-television-snog-00n-ktx.jpg?itok=OrBT90M9\" alt=\"Videodrome (1983)\" title=\"Videodrome (1983)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Videodrome (1983)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>The film dares to indulge in disturbing imagery while simultaneously pondering whether such material can be harmful, capturing what makes it fearful while at the same time exhibiting its attraction, even fetishising the videotape itself as an erotic object.

It has turned up on <a href=\"https://www.cahiersducinema.com/produit/top-10-2017/\">several</a>\u00a0<a href=\"/node/17667\">Best Films of 2017</a> lists as Twin Peaks: The Return, and is often referred to as Twin Peaks Season 3. But the onscreen title reads simply Twin Peaks, and though each of its 18 \u2018parts\u2019 is individually named, these names are absent from the opening credits.</p>\n<div class=\"content-information\">\n<p><strong>Twin Peaks: The Return</strong> remains available to stream on <a href=\"https://www.sky.com/watch/title/programme/881d225f-97bb-4c02-8d60-e8001576ea12/twin-peaks-the-return-box-set\">Sky Atlantic</a>, <a href=\"http://watch.nowtv.com/watch-entertainment/twin-peaks-return/cbcbfeb688f52510VgnVCM1000000b43150a____\">Now! TV</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sho.com/twin-peaks\">Showtime</a> in the USA, and to buy on Blu-ray and DVD as\u00a0<strong>Twin Peaks: A Limited Event Series</strong>.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Of course, none of these issues are particularly unusual where television is concerned, and the questions they raise in this context can be traced to an uncertainty (addressed by Nick James in his editorial, Category Error, for the <a href=\"/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/february-2018-issue\">February issue of Sight &amp; Sound</a>) as to whether what we are dealing with here is a TV series (it premiered, one episode a week, on Sky Atlantic and Showtime), a lengthy film (it was screened over the course of three days <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/events/3861\">at New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art</a>), or something else entirely.</p>\n<p>The original Twin Peaks is surely among the most \u2018impossible\u2019 shows to have originated in the US. If asked, circa 1989, to name those American directors least likely to flourish in episodic TV, David Lynch would have figured prominently on anyone\u2019s list. Nonetheless Twin Peaks proved, at least for a while, to be not only a phenomenal critical/commercial success, but one that worked entirely on its auteur\u2019s own idiosyncratic terms, melding an ironic view of melodramatic conventions with a surrealist vision. Indeed, Lynch has often been credited with irrevocably transforming television, paving the way for that Golden Age represented by The Sopranos (with its frequent recourse to dream sequences), The Wire, Breaking Bad and Mad Men.</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.32349949135\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/twin-peaks-1990-91-006-sheryl-lee-tv.jpg?itok=IBnndK7A\" alt=\"Sheryl Lee as Laura Palmer in Twin Peaks (1990)\" title=\"Sheryl Lee as Laura Palmer in Twin Peaks (1990)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.32349949135\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/twin-peaks-1990-91-006-sheryl-lee-tv.jpg?itok=IBnndK7A\" alt=\"Sheryl Lee as Laura Palmer in Twin Peaks (1990)\" title=\"Sheryl Lee as Laura Palmer in Twin Peaks (1990)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Sheryl Lee as Laura Palmer in Twin Peaks (1990)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Yet it could just as easily be argued that television transformed Lynch, previously a key postmodern figure. Whereas modernism viewed narrative as a problem, postmodernism viewed it as a joke, a hoax that had been exposed and deserved only our derision. <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6f6c85c4\">Blue Velvet</a> (1986) and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b79e253f5\">Wild at Heart</a> (1990) belong securely within this tradition, as does the feature-length Twin Peaks pilot.</p>\n<p>As the latter series developed, however, Lynch clearly found himself caring, in an unironic way, about characters who had initially existed in inverted commas, introducing a depth of feeling that would be retained in his later, more mature output. Turning from Twin Peaks\u2019s 1989 pilot to its prequel, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7ba4a007\">Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me</a> (1992), one is struck by the sharp difference in tone; the scene in the pilot in which we are asked to laugh at Deputy Andy Brennan (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bbed0f508\">Harry Goaz</a>)\u2019s grief upon confronting Laura Palmer (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2baa264b68\">Sheryl Lee</a>)\u2019s corpse feels callous in a manner that has no equivalent in the later film, or any of Lynch\u2019s subsequent theatrical efforts.</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.49516603615\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/twin-peaks-fire-walk-with-me-1992-002-kyle-maclachlan-sheryl-lee-red-00m-rg8.jpg?itok=wUYUtewe\" alt=\"Lee and MacLachlan in Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992)\" title=\"Lee and MacLachlan in Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.49516603615\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/twin-peaks-fire-walk-with-me-1992-002-kyle-maclachlan-sheryl-lee-red-00m-rg8.jpg?itok=wUYUtewe\" alt=\"Lee and MacLachlan in Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992)\" title=\"Lee and MacLachlan in Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Lee and MacLachlan in Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>If Lynch is unique in having progressed from a postmodernist to a modernist position, the revived Twin Peaks suggests he may now be essaying an entirely new mode \u2013 and still progressing by moving backwards. When I first saw <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8bf0cf11\">Inland Empire</a> (2006), I had the impression this would be Lynch\u2019s cinematic finale; the communal celebration with which it concludes indicated he had achieved a personal/artistic resolution, rendering anything he might do afterwards redundant. And one can hardly describe the new Twin Peaks as free of redundancy; on the contrary, it is very much about redundancy, treating narrative as less a dynamic process than a form of stasis, something constantly folding back upon itself (ultimately folding all the way back to the opening shots of the 1989 pilot).</p>\n<p>Positioning the new Twin Peaks as an expanded footnote to its earlier incarnation enables Lynch to tap into something fundamental about the storytelling process, specifically (though not exclusively) as it functions in television. The episodic series is usually seen as a format in which narrative reigns supreme. Yet by their very nature these series cannot stray too far from a point of departure, which explains why even the best of them often feel as if they are treading water. In The Sopranos, this repetitiveness is part of the point, its various plotlines dealing with individuals who are incapable of change; the Tony Soprano we bid farewell to at the end of episode 86 in 2007 is essentially the one we greeted at the start of episode one in 1999 (his total failure to profit from his numerous therapy sessions is far more revealing than anything he actually says during them).</p>\n<p>Twin Peaks takes a different but complementary approach, narrative itself, rather than the characters\u2019 emotional limitations, being the central concern. If long-form televisual works habitually stretch out their stories, the stretching here becomes an aesthetic event.</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.89723320158\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/twin-peaks-the-return-2017-041-sweeping-roadhouse.jpg?itok=RjVKd8TZ\" alt=\"Twin Peaks: the Return (2017)\" title=\"Twin Peaks: the Return (2017)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.89723320158\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/twin-peaks-the-return-2017-041-sweeping-roadhouse.jpg?itok=RjVKd8TZ\" alt=\"Twin Peaks: the Return (2017)\" title=\"Twin Peaks: the Return (2017)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">Twin Peaks: the Return (2017)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Take a scene from episode seven, set inside the Roadhouse. As it begins, we see Jean Michel Renault (<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba3019dd7\">Walter Olkewicz</a>) standing behind a bar while a man sweeps the floor. This shot continues for almost two minutes before a phone rings and Renault answers.</p>\n<p>An image we may at first read as an establishing shot gradually morphs into something much richer and stranger, perhaps a Godardian disquisition on the nature of work and play. Television viewing belongs to our leisure hours, an activity we engage in to escape or forget the realities of alienated labour \u2013 surely the last thing we want to do while being entertained is spend several minutes watching a man sweep a floor. Once we begin to adjust our expectations and appreciate the audacity of this rule-breaking approach, though, the shot becomes not only hypnotic but also hilariously funny, its humour being generated by our self-awareness \u2013 we laugh at ourselves for expecting to see something other than what Lynch ends up showing us.</p>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/twin-peaks-the-return-2017-037-kyle-mclachlan-sheryl-lee-holding-hands-night-house-lawn.jpg?itok=-jmSMUQS\" alt=\"MacLachlan and Lee in Twin Peaks: The Return (2017)\" title=\"MacLachlan and Lee in Twin Peaks: The Return (2017)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/twin-peaks-the-return-2017-037-kyle-mclachlan-sheryl-lee-holding-hands-night-house-lawn.jpg?itok=-jmSMUQS\" alt=\"MacLachlan and Lee in Twin Peaks: The Return (2017)\" title=\"MacLachlan and Lee in Twin Peaks: The Return (2017)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">MacLachlan and Lee in Twin Peaks: The Return (2017)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<p>The discovery that serial structures can be extended in ways that have little or nothing to do with (and may be directly opposed to) narrative progress thus brings Twin Peaks into the realm of slow cinema; the aforementioned shot could easily belong to one of <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bc57976fa\">Lav Diaz</a>\u2019s epics, whose comparably daunting running times have very different connotations. Yet Lynch demands we perceive this work in precisely those commercial terms it renders so problematic, and if the notion of the TV series as part of a flow of programming has been obscured by the existence of streaming and DVD/Blu-ray box sets, the new Twin Peaks evokes this concept through a glass darkly, even bearing ghostly traces of other televisual formats; like a chat show, most of its episodes end with performances by musical guest stars (the first season did something similar by incorporating a soap opera, Invitation to Love, into its fictional universe).</p>\n<p>Lynch\u2019s latest creation is thus a perfect example of a \u2018between\u2019 text \u2013 between cinema and television, modernism and postmodernism, narrative and non-narrative, work and play. Suspended precisely between two opposed regimes of images \u2013 one promising undemanding entertainment, the other stylistic rigour \u2013 it demonstrates that the gap separating Hollywood from the avant-garde may not be so wide as we might think.</p>\n</div>]]></content:encoded>\n   <link>http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/comment/bradlands/twin-peaks-david-lynch-stretches-television-unknown</link>\n   <author>Brad  Stevens</author>\n   <media:content url=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/google_newsstand_1x1/public/news/twin-peaks-season-3-2017-008-in-red-room-with-the-arm-CROP.jpg?itok=7QaDvBkH\" type=\"image/jpeg\" expression=\"full\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\">\n    <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[How Twin Peaks stretches television into the unknown]]></media:description>\n   </media:content>\n  </item>\n  <item>\n   <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">news-opinion/news-bfi/features/derek-jarman-box-sets</guid>\n   <pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\n   <title>Behind the scenes on our new Derek Jarman box-sets</title>\n   <description>&lt;div class=&quot;rss-content-container&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archival research for our new Derek Jarman Blu-ray box-sets brought to light an array of material pinpointing the maverick director&amp;#8217;s work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022\u00a0&lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.bfi.org.uk/new-releases/available-to-pre-order/derek-jarman-volume-1-1976-1986-blu-ray.html#.WnCl9jpLFPY&quot;&gt;Pre-order the Derek Jarman Volume 1: 1976-1986 (Limited edition Blu-ray set)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</description>\n   <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class=\"rss-content-container\"><p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33364661654\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/angelic-conversation-the-1985-003-close-up-men-embracing.jpg?itok=DxQp9pjG\" alt=\"The Angelic Conversation (1985)\" title=\"The Angelic Conversation (1985)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33364661654\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/angelic-conversation-the-1985-003-close-up-men-embracing.jpg?itok=DxQp9pjG\" alt=\"The Angelic Conversation (1985)\" title=\"The Angelic Conversation (1985)\" /></noscript>      <div class=\"legend\">\n    <p>      <span class=\"caption\">The Angelic Conversation (1985)</span><br />\n            </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</p>\n<div class=\"content-information\">\n<p><a href=\"http://shop.bfi.org.uk/new-releases/available-to-pre-order/derek-jarman-volume-1-1976-1986-blu-ray.html#.WnCl9jpLFPY\">Pre-order the Derek Jarman Volume 1: 1976-1986 (Limited Edition Blu-ray set)</a></p>\n</div>\n<p>Last year we announced the upcoming release of a new <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9ee390dd\">Derek Jarman</a> Blu-ray box set.

Indeed, you would need top 10s covering the periods 1914-28 and 1929-48 to do full justice to his achievement and include such items as the mockingly satirical <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6bfe6ebb\">Anna Boleyn</a> (1920), the deceptively incisive <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6ae757a9\">Lady Windermere&#8217;s Fan</a> (1926), the scandalously underrated Broken Lullaby (1932) and the knowingly quirky <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6a7bab4b\">Cluny Brown</a> (1946).</p>\n<p>Arriving in Hollywood from Berlin in 1922 having helped revitalise German cinema after the Great War, Lubitsch became a studio insider who refused to abide by the rules. On presenting him with an honorary Academy Award in 1947, fellow director Mervyn LeRoy commended this \u201cmaster of innuendo\u201d on his \u201cadult mind and a hatred of saying things the obvious way\u201d.</p>\n<p>Billy Wilder had a sign in his office that read: \u201cHow would Lubitsch do it?\u201d But there was much more to this enduringly influential filmmaker than the fabled \u2018Lubitsch touch\u2019.</p>\n<h3>Madame DuBarry (1919)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33345766505\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/madame-dubarry-1919-001-pola-negri-being-pulled-bfi-00m-ew7.jpg?itok=Xz3P4AsC\" alt=\"Madame DuBarry (1919)\" title=\"Madame DuBarry (1919)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33345766505\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/madame-dubarry-1919-001-pola-negri-being-pulled-bfi-00m-ew7.jpg?itok=Xz3P4AsC\" alt=\"Madame DuBarry (1919)\" title=\"Madame DuBarry (1919)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Having initially specialised in comedies with a Jewish slapstick flavour, Ernst Lubitsch became \u201cthe great humaniser of history\u201d with <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6af77fc1\">Madame DuBarry</a> and Anna Boleyn.

Taking cues from Charlie Chaplin&#8217;s A Woman of Paris (1923), with <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b00a236\">The Marriage Circle</a> he gazumped Cecil B.

Lubitsch slows the farce to allow the characters to betray their emotions with the slightest expressions and gestures.

He had previously filmed Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy&#8217;s play Reveillon as <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7172e8e8\">The Merry Jail</a> in 1917. But <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b687c29\">So This Is Paris</a> expands the narrative to explore the temptations facing doctor <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f98dcdd\">Monte Blue</a>, his daydreaming wife <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f67855e\">Patsy Ruth Miller</a> and their dance-team neighbours.</p>\n<p>Lubitsch litters the action with Freudian gags, but his masterstroke is the Artists Ball sequence, in which he employs superimposition and kaleidoscopic effects to convey the intoxicated exhilaration of the revellers.</p>\n<h3>The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg (1927)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.56695156695\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/student-prince-in-old-heidelberg-the-1927-001-pulling-dress.jpg?itok=aSdhnKSq\" alt=\"The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg (1927)\" title=\"The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg (1927)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.56695156695\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/student-prince-in-old-heidelberg-the-1927-001-pulling-dress.jpg?itok=aSdhnKSq\" alt=\"The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg (1927)\" title=\"The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg (1927)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Having acted in a 1915 take on Wilhelm Meyer-F\u00f6rster&#8217;s novel, Karl Heinrich, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba0eb7d1c\">Erich von Stroheim</a> was slated to direct this lavish <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b6dca3b\">MGM adaptation</a> as a follow-up to <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b04f4a1\">The Merry Widow</a> (1925). However, production chief <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba1c2349e\">Irving Thalberg</a> needed a project for the newly arrived Lubitsch and felt he would take better care of fianc\u00e9e <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f3ed3b6\">Norma Shearer</a> as Kathi the barmaid.</p>\n<p>In fact, Lubitsch fell out with Shearer and co-star <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f9cef69\">Ramon Novarro</a> while producing this most musical of silents. But, keeping his camera moving and making evocative use of the symbol-strewn sets, he slipped between intimate details and rousing set-pieces with peerless insight, wit and grace.</p>\n<h3>The Love Parade (1929)</h3>\n<p><div class=\"image full\">\n  <img class=\"lazy lazy-hidden\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33421650265\" data-src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/love-parade-the-1929-001-man-performing-in-front-of-woman-bfi-00m-evq.jpg?itok=_7QMVHJ0\" alt=\"The Love Parade (1929)\" title=\"The Love Parade (1929)\" /><noscript><img  data-aspect-ratio=\"1.33421650265\" src=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/styles/full/public/image/love-parade-the-1929-001-man-performing-in-front-of-woman-bfi-00m-evq.jpg?itok=_7QMVHJ0\" alt=\"The Love Parade (1929)\" title=\"The Love Parade (1929)\" /></noscript>  </div>\n</p>\n<p>Fresh from earning his first Oscar nomination with <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b2b7457\">The Patriot</a> (1928) and experimenting with synchronous sound on <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6a9a250a\">Eternal Love</a> (1929), Lubitsch transformed the nascent screen musical with this inspired Ruritanian romance.
