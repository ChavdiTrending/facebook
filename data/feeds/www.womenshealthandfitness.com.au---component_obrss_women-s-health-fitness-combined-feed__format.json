Homemade popcorn:</span></strong><span> Unlike our favourite buttery movie companion, this version is a low-calorie and high-fibre snack. Just add</span> \u00bd cup of corn kernels to a brown paper bag and microwave for a couple of minutes, until the popping slows down to one or two pops per second.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">\u201cHomemade popcorn is a fun wholegrain snack that provides you with roughly 1g of fibre and 1g of protein per cup for as little as 30 calories!\u201d says wholefood dietitian and nutritionist <a href=\"https://thebodydietetics.com/\">Larina Robinson</a>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">The best part? You can top with a touch of Himalayan salt and nut butter or spices such as turmeric or cinnamon for anti-inflammatory benefits. Or if you have the tastebuds for it, seaweed flakes are high in iodine, which is important for the normal functioning of the thyroid gland. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>2.<strong><span><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/[https:/www.fibreone.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;</a></span></strong></span></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.fibreone.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Fibre One</a><span class=\"s2\">\u2122&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>snacks: </strong>Sucker for a 3pm sweet hit but don\u2019t like making your own healthy treat? Try<a href=\"https://www.fibreone.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;<span class=\"s1\"></span></a><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/%5Bhttps:/www.fibreone.com.au/\">Fibre One</a><span class=\"s2\">\u2122</span><span class=\"s1\">&nbsp;</span>squares and brownies: these delicious snacks taste just like your traditional brownie, but with only 90 calories per serve.</p>\r\n<p><span>Plus, they come in two mouth-watering flavours: Chocolate Fudge Brownie and Salted Caramel Squares. For only </span><span>$5.49 for a pack of 5, it\u2019s hard to resist.</span></p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"fibreone.jpg\" src=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/images/fibreone.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>3. Tuna with wholegrain crackers: </span></strong><span>For a healthy alternative to cheese and crackers to get you through those never-ending emails,<strong> </strong>a handful of wholegrain crackers and a tin of tuna in springwater contains around 163 calories. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>This combo is high in protein and slow-releasing carbs, keeping you full for longer while not spiking blood sugar levels \u2013 the perfect afternoon or pre-workout fuel. </span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>4. Overnight oats: </span></strong><span>Add<strong> </strong></span>Greek yoghurt, almond milk, chia seeds, shredded coconut and cinnamon to a cup of rolled oats in a jar and leave to set overnight. Top with your favourite berries when ready to eat. A standard breakfast-sized jar contains around 370 calories but you can halve the serving amount for a morning or afternoon snack.</p>\r\n<p><span>Chia seeds are an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids and are high in fibre, aiding digestion, and cinnamon has anti-inflammatory properties. </span>You\u2019ll reap myriad benefits from all of the ingredients, according to Robinson.</p>\r\n<p>\u201cIt contains protein for muscle repair and to keep you feeling full for longer, slow-releasing carbohydrates for sustained energy and for stabilising blood sugar levels, fibre to support digestion and control weight, antioxidants to fight free radical that damage the body\u2019s cells, and healthy fats for supple skin and healthy hair,\u201d she says.</p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"Overnight-oats1.jpg\" src=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/images/Overnight-oats1.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>5. Homemade hommus with vegie sticks: </span></strong><span>Ditch the packaged store-bought dips with unhealthy oils and additives and grab a tin of chickpeas and make your own hommus. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Chickpeas are rich in protein and soluble fibre, aiding digestion, reducing inflammation and helping with heart and bone health and maintaining weight. A 2-3 tablespoon serve is roughly 100-150 calories. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Cut carrot and cucumber into sticks for dipping and you have yourself a low calorie afternoon pick-me-up, plus it\u2019s a great way of getting in an extra serve of vegies.</span></p>\r\n<p><i><span>This piece was produced in partnership between Fibre One<sup>TM</sup> and Women\u2019s Health &amp; Fitness magazine.</span></i></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/healthy-eating/2429-5-tasty-low-calorie-snacks\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 23:15:17 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/healthy-eating/2429-5-tasty-low-calorie-snacks</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>Bedroom makeover: how to get a good nights sleep</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2417-bedroom-makeover-how-to-get-a-good-nights-sleep</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>&nbsp;Interiors blogger and stylist <a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/dotandpop.com.au\" target=\"_blank\">Eve Gunson</a> shows you how to design the perfect room for catching plenty of <a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/health-beauty/health-advice/1955-the-importance-of-sleep\" target=\"_blank\">sleep.</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Calmness is key:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Creating a space that provides a sense of relaxation and restfulness is the most important factor and freshly washed bed linen can really help you drift off. Try washing your sheets once a week and adding a fragrance such as lavender (which research shows has calming and soothing effects) to help you unwind.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Lighting:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Use bedside lamps, pendants or floor lamps to create soft, ambient lighting. Add a dimmer to downlights if possible and try turning bright lights off at least two hours before bedtime to help you fall asleep more quickly. Insufficient window coverings also won\u2019t help, so try block-out blinds, heavy curtains or shutters to make sure you rest in the dark.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Keep it green:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Bringing plants into your bedroom can have purifying benefits \u2013 think lavender, jasmine and peace lily, which have cleansing effects to help you sleep.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Air flow:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Make sure your bedroom isn\u2019t stuffy. If possible, open your window slightly or invest in a ceiling fan to circulate the air. Although air flow is important, it\u2019s not so at the expense of quietness \u2013 only open your window if your neighbourhood is quiet.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Colour palette:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">When choosing colours for your bedroom keep them simple and calming. Try white, grey, pale blue or earthy, muted tones. If your style is bold and more about statement, try choosing navy over bright blue, blush and burgundy over bright pinks, or a soft sea mist over lime green. Avoid bright colours as busy patterns don\u2019t promote rest and relaxation. When choosing furniture, bed linen, artwork and d\u00e9cor items, keep it simple: less is more; you are trying to create a sanctuary, not a child\u2019s play room.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Keep it simple:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Remove anything distracting, such as bills, paperwork and reminders of work, which might promote stressful thoughts. Keep any clutter at bay by organising items and investing in functional wardrobes that will hide mess easily.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Furniture positioning:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">A chaotic room will cause disturbed sleep patterns. Arrange your furniture so that it\u2019s centred and symmetrical, helping you to feel centred and peaceful.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Make it cosy:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">We spend one-third of our lives in bed, so it\u2019s important to invest in a quality mattress. A big bed is ideal if you sleep next to a partner to prevent rolling over and waking each other up. Make it cosy and inviting with layers of gorgeous bed linen, throws and cushions.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2417-bedroom-makeover-how-to-get-a-good-nights-sleep\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2018 06:44:35 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2417-bedroom-makeover-how-to-get-a-good-nights-sleep</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>5 minutes with February 2018 cover model Ellie Giffen</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2413-5-minutes-with-february-2018-cover-model-ellie-giffen</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"intro\">We sat down with February 2018 cover model Ellie Giffen to chat about all things health, fitness and lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>EAT</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">There isn\u2019t much I won\u2019t eat. I love food and have mastered a happy medium between my love for gourmet ingredients and clean eating. For example, I love eating fresh fish but I season it with freshly squeezed lemon, coriander, ripe cherry tomatoes, ginger and cracked pepper. Instead of having it with plain steamed vegies, I might throw together a salad with some sweet mango, mint and fresh chilli. My nutrition needs to excite me and be ever changing.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>MOVE</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">A typical week of training includes a variety of workouts. I typically only spend two days in a gym and the other days are either spent in a Pilates studio (KX Pilates in Adelaide is incredible), on the beach (running or walking) or on a yoga mat at home (I invested in a TRX, which is amazing for bodyweight workouts and is responsible for my strong core).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>THRIVE</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">My short-term goals are simple: I\u2019ve accepted that life does not need to be extravagant all the time for it to be fulfilling. If we are constantly striving for the next big thing we will miss what is right in front of us. I aim to continue with the little things that bring me joy such as painting, eating good food, swimming in the ocean, camping and spending my time with people who make me feel good.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Long term, I see myself working as a social worker in women\u2019s mental health. At the risk of sounding clich\u00e9, I really do want to help others or at the very least let women know that they are not alone and have an important place in this world.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>BE</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">To de-stress I hug my dog, put on a good playlist or watch an epic make-up tutorial on YouTube. I also enjoy shopping, reading a novel until 3am and running through sand dunes. I used to believe that every waking second of my day had to be productive, but I\u2019ve learnt that the more relaxed I am, the more productive I become!</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Model: </strong>Ellie Giffen // <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/miss_elliesue/\" target=\"_blank\">@miss_elliesue</a></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Photographer:</strong> Dannielle McPherson //<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/danniellemcphersonphotography/\" target=\"_blank\">@danniellemcphersonphotography</a></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>HMU: </strong>Sophie Williams // <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sophiewilliamsmakeupartistry/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">@sophiewilliamsmakeupartistry</a></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Grab the February 2018 edition for her full cover story and more!</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2413-5-minutes-with-february-2018-cover-model-ellie-giffen\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2018 03:34:32 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2413-5-minutes-with-february-2018-cover-model-ellie-giffen</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>Why the Golden Door Elysia Health Retreat &amp; Spa is the best way to start the new year</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2412-why-the-golden-door-elysia-health-retreat-spa-is-the-best-way-to-start-the-new-year</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Whether it\u2019s a detox coming out of the festive period or a weekend getaway with the girls minus the extra holiday kilos, there\u2019s no denying that health and fitness retreats are in high demand. But are they really worth your hard-earned coin?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"golden-door-5.jpg\" src=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/images/golden-door-5.jpg\" /></strong></p>\r\n<p>We sent <i>WH&amp;F</i> editor Katelyn Swallow to world-renowned&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goldendoor.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Golden Door Elysia Health Retreat &amp; Spa</a> in the Hunter Valley, NSW, to find out what all the fuss is about.</p>\r\n<p>I've been to a fair few health retreats in my time, but nothing could have prepared me for the rolling hills and glimpses of grapevines my friend Tiffany and I experienced as we drove up to the iconic gates of the Golden Door Health Retreat. Perched on a hill overlooking the valley\u2019s wineries and Brokenback mountain range \u2013 about two-and-a-half hours\u2019 drive from Sydney and just 45 minutes from Newcastle \u2013 we were welcomed by <a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/goldendoor.com.au\" target=\"_blank\">Golden Door </a>staff in their luxe marbled foyer. Almost instantly, I felt the stresses of the week\u2019s work begin to melt away thanks to the steady trickle of their indoor water feature.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">As a self-confessed gym junkie, I was a bit wary of bringing a friend with differing interests along for the ride. But on closer inspection of Golden Door\u2019s program, I realised there was something for everyone&nbsp;\u2013 no \u2018go hard or go home\u2019 bootcamps here. Whether you\u2019re wanting a week-long wellness reset with the girls or just a romantic two-night getaway with your significant other, Golden Door\u2019s all inclusive <a href=\"https://www.goldendoor.com.au/golden-door-health-retreat-elysia/reservations/rates-packages/\" target=\"_blank\">packages</a> have you covered.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Designed as an oasis for the mind, body and spirit, you can opt in or out of any activity on the retreat timetable, accommodating meditative yogi to squat enthusiast \u2013 and everyone in between:</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>For the lover of creature comforts</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Both Tiffany and I are unapologetically fans of a good night\u2019s rest and Golden Door\u2019s voguish accommodation did not disappoint. A leisurely two-minute stroll from the front desk found us outside one of their 74 on-site villas (there are one, two or three bedroom options available), which we would call home for the next two nights. Stunning views from the balcony, huge ensuite bathrooms, a spacious king bed and even a self-contained kitchen, it was the perfect place to curl up with a book and recoup after a \u2018busy\u2019 day exercising, eating and relaxing.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>For the foodie</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><strong style=\"font-size: 15px;\"><img alt=\"golden-door-4-food.jpg\" src=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/images/golden-door-4-food.jpg\" /></strong></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">If there isn\u2019t food, don't invite me \u2013 particularly if I need to step a toe into the kitchen. And it seems Golden Door knew I was coming. All main meals plus two snacks are delivered daily by the in-house chef, including a buffet-style breakfast, so all you have to do is eat.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Meals are mostly plant based and dairy free, aside from small portions of chicken and fish, and coffee was banned to give your hard-working adrenals a rest. But who knew healthy cooking could taste that good? And that\u2019s coming from a self-confessed carnivore!</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cOur Golden Door menu is not completely vegetarian and we do provide options for a caffeine non-detox [if requested] to guests wanting a soft landing into health and wellness cuisine. However, limiting animal proteins to poultry and seafood keeps the menu nice and lean,\u201d says executive chef James Knight.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cOur menu has been crafted to nourish guests as well as inspire them, so we limit things that tend to be consumed in excess and show them how it\u2019s possible to use this variety of produce at home. With plenty of colourful fruits, salads and vegetables (many straight from our organic kitchen garden), our guests experience a cleaner way of eating that is still incredibly satisfying.\u201d</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">By the end of the first day, once the detox headaches subsided, my digestion had improved, the bloat was gone and I slept through the night for the first time in a long time. And if, like me, you hate beetroot on your salad \u2013 no fret. Kitchen hand Lita (who knew all 30 guests\u2019 names by the end of day one, just FYI) will accommodate all your dietary preferences.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr class=\"system-pagebreak\" title=\" Golden Door Elysia Health Retreat &amp; Spa\" />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>For the yogi</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"Golden-Door-Lifestyle_2066.jpg\" src=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/images/Golden-Door-Lifestyle_2066.jpg\" /></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">If you think sweating it out in a HIIT class is akin to torture, or if injury is a concern, choose to take the path to Zen. Tiffany and I started our first day at the retreat with an early morning tai chi class, overlooking the valley as the sun was just peaking over the horizon, followed by a walk around the adjacent golf course.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Beginner to advanced yoga and Pilates classes are offered throughout the day, or learn how to harness the power of breath in one of the evening workshops.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">But whether you\u2019re a budding yogi or as conservative as they come, don\u2019t skip the daily Meditation 101 classes. The experienced instructors can get even the busiest brain to relax, trialling different techniques so you, too. find your best fit.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cA huge block when it comes to meditation is that people believe they have to empty the mind and completely stop thinking. When that fails to happen, a barrier is formed, \u2018I can\u2019t meditate,\u2019\u201d says program and guest experience manager Damian Rocks.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cBut meditation is not about not thinking, it is simply about finding a point of focus for a period of time. This focus can be on <i>anything</i>, as long as it is with intention, and can last for three seconds or 30 minutes; focused intention, regardless of length of time, is still a form of meditation. And just one physiological benefit of many is an increased capacity for problem-solving in the pre-frontal cortex, allowing the brain to work more efficiently.\u201d<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>For the gym junkie</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">If you\u2019re using the retreat as a way to get back your fitness mojo, prepare to be sore but inspired by the end of your stay. Each morning starts with a short and sharp stretch session to loosen tight and tired muscles. You can then choose to sweat through a high intensity spin class, tough it out in their fully equipped gym as part of a group circuit, book a one-on-one personal training session or work out your frustrations with a boxing lesson.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Our pick? One of the AM low-impact deep water running classes! Far from your typical aqua aerobics class, you\u2019ll leave the huge heated pool with a definite sweat. Follow it up with a quick sauna and spa and, like us, you\u2019ll feel light and satisfied \u2013 all before breakfast.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr class=\"system-pagebreak\" title=\" Golden Door Elysia Health Retreat &amp; Spa\" />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>For the self-indulgent</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><strong style=\"font-size: 15px;\"><img alt=\"golden-door-3---pool.jpg\" src=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/images/golden-door-3---pool.jpg\" /></strong></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Many of our fellow retreat guests took a day to simply de-stress, sipping herbal tea and getting pampered at the retreat\u2019s in-house spa. Offering all your standard spa treatments such as manicures and facials \u2013 plus a few just left of centre \u2013 you get one to two treatments complementary, depending on your package. Tiff and I opted for the Cleopatra: essentially a full-body exfoliation treatment and mud wrap \u2013 we had skin smoother than a baby\u2019s bottom for weeks.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>The verdict</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">After just three days at Golden Door Health Retreat, I felt completely at ease: my skin was glowing, my stomach flat and the usual ball of stress and anxiety in my stomach had unknotted. My digestion and sleep were improved, and I was two kilos lighter on the scales.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">But far beyond the physical were the nutrition and exercise habits and education I took away home with me. In a sentence, I would describe Golden Door as an intensive health, fitness and mindset overhaul \u2013 with beautiful long-term benefits.

Here are three ways to maintain it.</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The key is to tone down rather than completely halt your exercise regimen, but maintaining motivation during times of temptation generally comes down to how you think about your training. If heading for the bench press doesn\u2019t excite you, you\u2019ll likely forego exercise for the call of cosmos.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Follow the experts\u2019 top tips for maintaining motivation:</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>\u00bb Look on the bright side: </strong></span><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe relationship you have with exercise will depend on how you prioritise it and whether toning down your training will have positive effects or not. If you view exercise as punishment or to purely burn calories rather than seeing it for its mental and physical health benefits, then you\u2019re less likely to enjoy it and remain consistent. When you value and enjoy exercise \u2013 you prioritise it,\u201d says Brooke Turner.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>\u00bb Develop an exercise routine before summer hits so motivation isn\u2019t an issue next season: </strong></span><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe development of positive habits and routines is important for mental wellbeing, with a holistic and flexible approach. Ideally, a good exercise routine should be sustainable and easily modified and adapted to take life changes into account, and having a number of different activities you participate in can help,\u201d says clinical psychologist Dr<a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/bluehorizoncounselling.com.au\" target=\"_blank\"> Yuliya Richard.</a><br /></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>\u00bb Modify your routine: </strong></span><span class=\"s1\">King suggests experimenting with outdoor activities during this time that take advantage of summer\u2019s social theme and heat. Think learning to surf or a game of beach volleyball with friends. Try mixing up such activities with bootcamps, walking, swimming, running, yoga, Pilates and gym sessions; this way you have options depending on the season and weather moving into the new year.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2411-how-to-maintain-motivation-over-the-holiday-season\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2018 00:37:10 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2411-how-to-maintain-motivation-over-the-holiday-season</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>Superfood strawberry protein milkshake recipe</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/recipe-finder/2410-superfood-strawberry-protein-milkshake-recipe</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"intro\">Alleviate the brain fog and keep your mood in check with this protein smoothie.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Ingredients (makes one smoothie)</strong></span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"p3\">1 cup coconut, soy or almond milk</li>\r\n<li class=\"p3\">1 scoop <a href=\"https://activatednutrients.com/products/vanilla-bean-daily-protein-1\" target=\"_blank\">Activated Nutrients Vanilla Bean Daily Protein</a></li>\r\n<li class=\"p3\">1 teaspoon Activated Nutrients Daily Superfood powder</li>\r\n<li class=\"p3\">Approximately 7 frozen, sliced strawberries</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Method</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">1.

Co-founder of <a href=\"https://kicgirls.com/commit\" target=\"_blank\">Keep it Cleaner</a>, a health blog and fitness program with a healthy food range to boot, she is inspiring women all over Australia to chase their dreams and start their own side-hustle. This is how she does it.</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>On modelling</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">I started modelling when I was 19. My first agent approached me at my cousin\u2019s engagement party, and I started by doing mostly runway and editorial. As I grew into my body and became curvier, I moved into more commercial work, which I love because I don\u2019t feel any pressure to be a certain size.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>On shifting direction</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">I got into the health and fitness industry when I started a health blog, simply as something to do while I was modelling overseas. Soon after I got back, my business partner and friend Steph [Smith] and I created our first Keep it Cleaner project, which was our eBook. I now do more model jobs that reflect my new direction, which is often with amazing health and fitness brands. I am really lucky now that my modelling is booked for who I am and not just for what I look like.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>On studying law</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">I have always found law really interesting. I never thought I would ever get a good enough score to get into it and couldn\u2019t believe when I actually got in. I don\u2019t want to be a lawyer anymore, but I am so grateful for everything I have learnt so far and still plan to finish the degree. It has helped me to problem solve and think analytically, which I have to do in our business every day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>On social media success</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">I still can\u2019t understand why people want to follow my life, let alone 125,000 people! The biggest \u2018Is this for real?\u2019 moment was seeing our Keep it Cleaner products in Coles. If you told me we\u2019d be in Coles two years ago, there is no way in the world I would have believed you. It really is a dream come true.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>On achieving a summer body</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I believe that if you have a body and a bikini\u2026you have a summer body! Although I do understand that feeling healthy makes you feel so much more comfortable in a bikini. One of the main messages from our KIC Girls program is to avoid fad diets and make healthy living your lifestyle so you don\u2019t have to panic diet before your beach holiday. If you find a healthy balance, you will find your healthy weight, be full of energy and feel more confident in your own skin. It should never be about trying to look like someone else; being unique is special and we should all celebrate that.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>On my personality</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Bubbly and positive\u2026and maybe a bit nerdy \u2013 is that a personality trait?</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>On my favourite workout</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">I love running \u2013 it is my form of meditation. No matter what kind of day I have had, I can always rely on a run to declutter my thoughts and to feel less stressed. Running is also amazing for toning legs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>On my cheat meal</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Hot chips\u2026I simply cannot resist.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>On role models</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">I suppose I have different role models for different parts of my life. My mum has taught me to work as hard as I can and to believe in myself. In a business sense, Janine Allis and Lisa Messenger are big role models for me. And of course Steph is an amazing business partner, best friend and inspiration to me.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>On the future</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Long term, I hope to grow the Keep it Cleaner brand as much as I can with Steph. We aim to expand KIC Girls, reach more women and expand our range in Coles to make more healthy food options available to everyone.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>Short term, I want to start appreciating and celebrating my small achievements more; it\u2019s so easy to let them pass without stopping and letting it sink in.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><br class=\"Apple-interchange-newline\" />Model:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/laura.henshaw/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Laura Henshaw</a>&nbsp;//&nbsp;<i>kicgirls.com</i>&nbsp;// @laura.henshaw // @keepitcleaner<br /><strong>Photographer:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/renpidgeon/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Ren Pidgeon</a>&nbsp;// @renpidgeon<br /><strong>HMU:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/monicagingold_beauty/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Monica Gingold</a>&nbsp;// @monicagingold_beauty</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>On the cover wearing: </strong><a href=\"https://www.jaggad.com/\" target=\"_blank\">JAGGAD</a> &amp;<a href=\"https://www.lululemon.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\"> lululemon</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2408-laura-henshaw-on-health-fitness-and-success\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2018 02:44:30 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2408-laura-henshaw-on-health-fitness-and-success</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>Snickers nice-cream recipe</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/recipe-finder/2406-snickers-nice-cream-recipe</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"intro\">Treat yourself to this delicious nice-cream this Valentine's Day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"intro\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ingredients&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">4 frozen bananas, chopped &nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00bc cup peanut butter&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1 tbsp mesquite powder</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1 tsp vanilla bean powder&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00bc tsp salt&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Choc tahini sauce:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2 tbsp cacao powder&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1 tbsp hulled tahini&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1 tbsp coconut nectar&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Boiling water, add until desired consistency is reached</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Method</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1.&nbsp;First&nbsp;prepare the choc tahini sauce.

You need to make sure that what you\u2019re trying to do is in fact achievable and realistic; and if you feel that the goal meets all these criteria, then set a timeframe to help keep you on track,\u201d says&nbsp;<span class=\"s1\">exercise physiologist Naomi Ferstera.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\">\u201cGive yourself mini-goals within your goal. If you have 20kg to lose, set a goal for 5kg. It\u2019s incredibly motivating to tick these off along the way.\u201d</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong><strong>WRITE IT DOWN: </strong>Write all your achievements down in a little logbook to track your progress.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong><strong>PHONE A FRIEND:</strong> Have a qualified individual on speed dial who can support you and hold you accountable to your goals. Choose somebody you can confide in, who\u2019ll get excited for your little victories and give you support when you\u2019ve strayed.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\">Even better, find a resolution \u2018buddy\u2019 to share the load. But again, choose wisely.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\">\u201cYou need to partner with people who will bring a positive mindset and share your determination,\u201d says Kusal Goonewardena, sports physiotherapist and founder of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://eliteakademy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Elite Akademy.</a></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong><strong>FIX YOUR ATTITUDE:</strong> What you don\u2019t want is for the resolution to feel like a burden that is controlling you. Remind yourself that you are calling the shots and try to keep your attitude as relaxed \u2013 yet focused \u2013 as possible.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\">\u201cIt\u2019s important to \u2018remain in choice\u2019 about your goal,\u201d says Irving. \u201cIf you set a goal and then tell yourself you \u2018have to\u2019 do it, you\u2019re undermining your own intention. Remain in choice&nbsp;\u2013 that you\u2019re choosing to do whatever it is you\u2019ve agreed with yourself to do \u2013 and it won\u2019t begin to feel like a burden. You\u2019ve chosen it and you continue to choose it.\u201d</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>5.&nbsp;</strong><strong>PICK A BEAT:</strong> Don\u2019t forget the soundtrack.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\">\u201cMake sure you\u2019ve got some motivation music,\u201d says Ferstera. \u201cWhen I feel like quitting, I think about all my goals and put on my \u2018pump up\u2019 music. This distracts me from my negative feelings and gets me focused on my goals again.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2398-the-key-to-successful-health-and-fitness-resolutions\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2018 06:08:31 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2398-the-key-to-successful-health-and-fitness-resolutions</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>Lola Berry's nutrition bowl recipe</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/recipe-finder/2396-lola-berry-s-nutrition-bowl-recipe</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 15px;\">This pretty creation is a nutritional&nbsp;</span>goldmine<span style=\"font-size: 15px;\">&nbsp;full of all the good, healthy and delicious stuff.

I spend so much time making these bowls look pretty that they often look too good to eat \u2026 almost!</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Ingredients</strong></span></p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s3\">\u00bd kent pumpkin, chopped into 2.5 cm chunks (I keep the skin on but you don\u2019t have to)</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s3\">\u00bd head of broccoli, florets chopped</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s3\">Salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s3\">Pinch of chilli flakes (optional)</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s3\">3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s3\">2 handfuls of rocket</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s3\">\u00bd punnet (100 g) cherry tomatoes, halved</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s3\">2 eggs, boiled and halved lengthways</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s3\">\u2153 cup sauerkraut or kimchi</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s3\">1 tbsp black and white sesame seeds</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s3\">1 avocado, halved lengthways</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s3\">Lime wedges, to serve</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s3\">\u00bd tsp dulse flakes</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Method</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0C. Line two baking trays with baking paper. Spread the pumpkin chunks and broccoli florets over the prepared tray and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle over the chilli flakes (if using), drizzle over 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the veggies are nice and crispy.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Remove from the oven and leave to cool slightly. To assemble your salad, take two serving bowls and place a handful of rocket in each one to make a bed for all your other goodies.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">On top, in separate mounds, arrange the cherry tomatoes, egg halves, sauerkraut or kimchi, pumpkin and broccoli. Place the mixed sesame seeds on a plate, then gently press the cut side of each avo half into the seeds to coat the surface evenly. Place the avo halves on the salad and season.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">To serve, add the lime wedges, drizzle over the remaining olive oil and sprinkle with the dulse flakes. Take a pic for social media (you\u2019ll be so proud of how amazing this looks), then pop the phone aside and take a moment to reflect on how lucky you are to be able to create and enjoy this awesome meal.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s4\">Recipes:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/yummololaberry/\"><span class=\"s5\">Lola Berry</span></a></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Photography:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/armellehabib/\"><span class=\"s6\">Armelle Habib</span></a></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">These recipes are a taste of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.panmacmillan.com.au/9781743548479/\"><span class=\"s6\">Food to Make You Glow</span></a>&nbsp;by Lola Berry, published by Plum.

She spoke to WH&amp;F about fostering a positive attitude in the face of adversity, finding love, and working to create a healthy and fit lifestyle.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>ON CAREER</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I have always loved sports and training. It began with my passion for figure skating as a child, followed by soccer in high school and then I joined the gym for the first time when I was 17. I remember walking into my first group fitness class and thinking that one day I\u2019d like to be an instructor on stage. It looked like so much fun to teach, motivate and train with a room full of people.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">After school, I did a bit of travelling and working before finally deciding to study physiotherapy in Gothenburg, Sweden. I had always been fascinated by the human body and movement; by its musculoskeletal and physiological systems. It was during my years at university that I started my career as a group fitness instructor. I started out teaching old-school freestyle aerobics and step, but have since moved more toward Les Mills pre-choreographed classes such as Bodypump, RPM and Bodybalance. I also teach yoga, which I absolutely love!</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>ON FINDING LOVE</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">It was during a study abroad in 2006 that I met my now husband, Mark (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/healthmanmark/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">@healthmanmark</a>). We did long distance for three years while I completed my <span class=\"s1\">physiotherapy degree before I finally made the move to the Gold Coast, Australia. These days I work as a personal trainer for our own business, 360Health, that Mark runs with business partner Rob Quatro. I train people of all ages and fitness levels, and enjoy helping clients rehabilitate and prevent injuries. I also train clients preparing for bodybuilding competitions, as well as providing online coaching services.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>ON PASSION &amp; PURPOSE</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">My aim and goal in any field \u2013 whether it be during PT, in the cycle studio or in a yoga class \u2013 is always to promote the benefits of physical exercise. In a society with so many lifestyle-related metabolic conditions, and abundant healthcare and medicines to aid almost any condition, using exercise to promote health is sometimes forgotten. I want to spread the knowledge that training can help treat and prevent a whole range of ailments.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I love what I do because I get to see so many lives completely transformed in this industry. And I\u2019m not just talking about the physical transformations (which of course are rewarding) but the changes to a person\u2019s quality of life: improved confidence and motivation, better energy levels, and a better social and family life too.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>ON AN AVERAGE DAY</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I get up early \u2013 usually by 4.30am. I train clients or take a class or two until about lunch. Most afternoons I teach group fitness as well.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>ON \u2018SUMMER BODIES\u2019</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I think it\u2019s great that people want to get fit for summer. It\u2019s a great time to start a new fitness regime given you will likely have more energy thanks to the light and warmth outside. However, I always try to promote staying fit and training year-round. Making your healthy nutrition and training part of your routine 365 days a year will ensure it feels natural and you will never have to struggle making drastic changes to your physique because of one season.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Make the commitment. Set pen to paper and write down your plan of attack. Set progress goals and when you want to achieve them by. Make sure you stick to the plan and keep yourself accountable \u2013 either by hiring yourself a PT or coach, or telling your friends and family what you hope to achieve.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>ON PERSONALITY</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I\u2019d describe my personality as happy and positive. I try my best to support and inspire friends, family and people around me. I put a lot of pressure on myself to perform, but I am learning that I also need rest and time to look after my body and mind.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">My childhood was a tough one. I had<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>loving parents, but both suffered from addiction \u2013<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>so I had quite a chaotic life growing up and I pretty much looked after myself from a very young age. I lost my mother when I was 18 and my father has since passed as well. I like to think these life experiences have made me persistent, strong and determined in life rather than weakened me.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>ON MY FAVOURITE EXERCISE</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">It would have to be teaching a crazy, tough RPM class! But I also love participating in group fitness and hot yoga classes.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>ON MY FAVOURITE \u2018TREAT\u2019 MEAL</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">A big bowl of pasta, I love it! And for a sweet treat anything including chocolate, lollies and ice-cream works!</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>ON MY ROLE MODEL</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I think Roger Federer is an absolute legend! He is so much more than the greatest of all time (GOAT) on the court, but also a humble, intelligent, kind man with absolute integrity.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>ON GOALS</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Short term, I am looking forward to getting back into a full training load. I have been dealing with an injury in my elbow for about six months now and it is continuously getting better with rest and very specific rehab training, but I can\u2019t wait to lift some heavy weights again.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Long term, I would like to become a person who inspires health and physical activity nationally and globally, through face-to-face meetings, coaching and group fitness. Becoming a master trainer for group fitness instructors has always been a dream.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Model: </strong>Alexandra Kierdorf-Robinson // <i>swedishalex.com</i> // @swedishalex</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Photographer: </strong>Jessica Apap // <i>jessicaapap.com</i> // @jessicaapap_photographer</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>HMU: </strong>Cynthia Smyth // <i>cynthiasmythmakeup.com.au</i> // @cynthiasmyth_makeup</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2393-keeping-fit-with-alexandra-kierdorf-robinson\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 03 Jan 2018 03:05:20 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2393-keeping-fit-with-alexandra-kierdorf-robinson</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>A day in the life of Laura Henshaw</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2392-a-day-in-the-life-of-laura-henshaw</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"intro\">We caught up with model, law student and entrepreneur and January 2018 cover model <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/laura.henshaw/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Laura Henshaw </a>to talk about a typical day in her shoes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>EAT</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>6:30am:</strong> wake up and have an espresso. I can\u2019t stomach food before training.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>8am (breakfast):</strong> protein-packed smoothie bowl or two whole eggs with \u00bd an avocado, spinach and smoked salmon. I always ensure I refuel my body with a high-protein-packed meal after training.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>12pm (lunch): </strong>tuna or chicken salad with loads of greens, crunchy seeds and avo. I dress my salad with olive oil, lemon juice and apple cider vinegar.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>3pm (snack): </strong>I always crave something sweet at this time, so I will have a homemade KIC smoothie ball or a handful of nuts with a piece of fruit or some berries.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>6:30pm (dinner):</strong> this is different every night, but usually I have heaps of vegies with either salmon, chicken or beef. I am loving baked salmon at the moment with a roasted Brussel sprout salad and some roasted sweet potato. The dinner recipes on KIC are a combination of my favourite dishes plus a whole heap of crowd pleasers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>8pm (after dinner): </strong>I always crave something sweet after dinner. I will have Greek yoghurt and berries, homemade banana ice-cream (just blend frozen bananas), or dark choc and a peppermint tea to aid with my digestion.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>MOVE</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">I am loving the training combination I have at the moment; I always change it up so I don\u2019t get bored or plateau. My training every week is a combination of HIIT, boxing, strength and running. I do boxing one or two times per week, HIIT twice a week and run about three or four times per week. I always make sure I have one rest day to let my body recover.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>THRIVE</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">I don\u2019t have many days that are the same, but I always get up between 6 and 7am and get my workout done early. I get back from the gym and have breakfast, and then if it is a quiet day I\u2019ll head to my office to catch up on emails. If I\u2019m busy, I\u2019m usually between shoots and meetings. Or sometimes I do all three! It really depends on the day. I also always ensure I switch off (or try as hard as I can to by 8pm) so I can spend quality time with my partner, Dalton.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>BE</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">I relax by<strong> </strong>running and switching off from social media for a few hours, or even a full day if I need it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Model:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/laura.henshaw/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Laura Henshaw</a> // <i>kicgirls.com</i> // @laura.henshaw // @keepitcleaner<br /> <strong>Photographer:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/renpidgeon/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Ren Pidgeon</a> // @renpidgeon<br /> <strong>HMU:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/monicagingold_beauty/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Monica Gingold</a> // @monicagingold_beauty<strong><br /></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Grab the January 2018 edition of <a href=\"https://www.subscribeandshop.com/subscriptions/womens-health-and-fitness-subscription\" target=\"_blank\">Women's Health and Fitness </a>for her full cover model story!</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2392-a-day-in-the-life-of-laura-henshaw\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2017 05:13:02 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2392-a-day-in-the-life-of-laura-henshaw</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>The real reason why you may binge on food</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/healthy-eating/2391-the-real-reason-why-you-may-binge-on-food</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>If sometimes is becoming often, here are some of the reasons why you may be eating too much \u2013 and what to do about it.</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Problem:</strong></span> Unbalanced macros</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">New research found our drive for protein is so powerful we overeat in our pursuit to consume more of it. A University of Sydney study published in Cell Metabolism reveals calorie intake increases as protein intake decreases.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Solution:</strong></span> The researchers recommend that high-quality protein \u2013 low in fat and high in good-quality complex carbohydrates \u2013 comprises 15 to 20 per cent of your daily calorie intake. Chow down on lean meats, legumes, fish, eggs and tofu.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Problem:</strong></span> Disconnection</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Whether it\u2019s the portion sizes at your local, a bout of intense work stress or mindless nibbling in front of the telly, there\u2019s a whole gamut of reasons why we eat more than what we need or when we\u2019re not hungry at all.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Solution:</strong></span> Try to eat intuitively \u2013 only when you\u2019re hungry. Focus on eating when you feel hungry and stopping when you feel full.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Problem:</strong></span> Overwhelm</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">It turns out the expression \u2018feast your eyes\u2019 is accurate. Research suggests that when we can choose from a wide variety of foods \u2013 say, at Christmas lunch or a hotel buffet breakfast \u2013 we eat more. Called the \u2018smorgasbord effect\u2019, new flavours are thought to stimulate renewed eating, whereas we quickly grow bored of a single flavour and stop eating sooner.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Solution: </strong></span>Limit yourself to a few choices rather than sampling a little of everything to keep the smorgasbord effect in check.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/healthy-eating/2391-the-real-reason-why-you-may-binge-on-food\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2017 03:41:55 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/healthy-eating/2391-the-real-reason-why-you-may-binge-on-food</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>Tiffiny Hall's 'Glow Bowl' recipe</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/recipe-finder/2389-tiffiny-hall-s-glow-bowl-recipe</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"intro\">Tuck into this delicious glow bowl filled with healthy goodness by trainer Tiffiny Hall.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ingredients (</strong><strong>Serves 2<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>// Prep: 10 min // Cook: 10 min)</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br /></strong><span class=\"s1\"></span></p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00bc cup mixed quinoa</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00bd fennel,&nbsp;shaved</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">2 cups baby spinach leaves</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00bd cup blueberries</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">2 tbsp pumpkin seeds</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">8 walnuts, roughly chopped</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">2 eggs, boiled, peeled and cut into quarters, to serve</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u00bd bunch mint,&nbsp;leaves picked</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">2 tbsp lemon juice</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">2 tbsp&nbsp;yoghurt</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">2 tbsp water</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong>Method</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">1.

We asked accredited practising dietitian and founder of Bites for Health for her expert insight.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Macros v calories</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Counting macronutrients rather than calories can ensure a more balanced overall diet; however, counting anything around food can be exhausting. The value of attending to macronutrients is to ensure that each meal contains a balance of protein, carbs and fats, which contributes to satiety \u2013 and pleasure of eating.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>What are the basic rules for setting a goal-appropriate macro ratio?</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This needs to be assessed by a sports dietitian or other specialist as the commonly professed means to calculate energy output with the aim of balancing energy in and out is unreliable. The total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) \u2013 based on basal metabolic rate multipled by a factor related to activity level \u2013 is almost always an estimate. Unless you have paid to get your actual energy expenditure measured, it\u2019s not reliable.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>What\u2019s a general guide for balancing macros?</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The human body is such a diverse thing \u2013 we are all different. Because of that there is no \u2018perfect diet\u2019 that fits everyone. The 40/40/20 espoused by many nutrition professionals ignores this. Certain people will feel tired having only 40 per cent of their diet from carbs, for example, and others will feel tired if they have more than 25 per cent of their diet from carbs. It\u2019s about finding what feels good for your individual body.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Is \u2018flexible dieting\u2019 such as \u2018If it fits your macros\u2019 (IIFYM) as liberated as it sounds?</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I think the theory that counting macros is flexible eating is a bit ridiculous. Flexible eating implies not having to follow rules around food, and not having to calculate or fiddle around with specific numbers. Focusing on having foods that nourish you, satisfy you and give you pleasure, without the numbers and the rules, is a real example of flexible eating.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">However, there are some people who count their macros and have a very balanced, enjoyable lifestyle \u2013 and this works well for them. In my view, for its amount of effort, it\u2019s probably not worth it.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Doesn\u2019t counting macros circumvent the tyranny of food protocols?</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This is a tough one. I agree with the concept of moral neutrality \u2013 no \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 foods. However, the message that you can eat what you want if it fits your macros doesn\u2019t emphasise eating nourishing foods for good health. There is a big difference between eating whatever you like and eating well.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>What are the drawbacks of selecting foods by macro count?</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">You could have a day\u2019s eating that fits your macros but comprises energy-dense, high-GI foods that would likely not keep you full for very long, making you starving later in the day. Ironically, it can lead to a nutrient-poor diet. Counting macros can be very counterproductive for people who are chronic dieters or who have an unhealthy relationship with food. Many people have been on numerous diets, and macro counting is just the next one. These people are generally advised to see a dietitian or therapist specialising in the non-diet approach.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>If not macros, what approach do you advocate for weight loss?</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Focusing on having balanced meals is not only easier, but often more enjoyable. We have no evidence that calorie-, energy- or macronutrient-controlled diets work long term for weight loss and know that it is much better to focus on having a nourishing diet that fuels your body with good food. A diet high in fibre is recommended to assist with overall health and is known to help stabilise blood sugars, assist in lowering cholesterol and help </span>prevent certain types of cancers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/healthy-eating/2388-a-dietitian-s-advice-on-flexible-dieting\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 19 Dec 2017 23:52:32 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/healthy-eating/2388-a-dietitian-s-advice-on-flexible-dieting</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>Your Christmas Day feasting game plan</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/healthy-eating/2384-your-christmas-day-feasting-game-plan</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"intro\">Prep yourself this Christmas with our extensive game plan that will see you enjoying the festivities without the guilt. Stephanie Osfield writes.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Christmas dinner is one of the biggest culinary deals of the year. If you only had to navigate that one day, things would be sweet \u2013 but it\u2019s the drinks and parties and picnics and BBQs throughout the festive season that can bite. This means you\u2019re out of your usual routine and not always cooking. You don\u2019t want to look like you\u2019re being all bah-humbug and not getting into the Christmas spirit, so you\u2019ll be eating festive food. But you also don\u2019t want to spend each event battling recriminations because you had too many chocolates.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Overthinking it? Absolutely not. Recent research published in The New England Journal of Medicine showed that in Germany, Japan and the US, holiday celebrations such as Thanksgiving and Golden Week do lead to weight gain. But the biggest kilos spike across the board occurred in the 10 days after Christmas. During this time, Germans gained an average 0.8 kilograms, Americans 0.6 kg and Japanese participants an average of 0.5 kg. And although most of those study participants shed roughly half of that weight, some of it remained. Consider the cumulative impact over time (the term \u2018kilo creep\u2019 persists for a reason).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If you\u2019re torn between sanctioned excess and an ascetic festive season with BYO almonds, follow our experts\u2019 plan to have your Christmas cake and eat it.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">1.&nbsp;</span>All Or Nothing&nbsp;</strong><strong>Thinking</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">You Think: \u2018I just broke my eating rules \u2013 I might as well eat whatever I want for the rest of the night.\u2019</p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong>The Fallout:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">\u201cAll or nothing thinking is a worrying cognitive distortion that contributes to overeating,\u201d says Sarah McMahon, psychologist and body image expert at Sydney\u2019s BodyMatters Australasia. \u201cIt can lead you to eat far more than you would have done if you had just given yourself permission to have a little of what you like.\u201d</p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong>Your Christmas Comeback:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>\u00bb Be compassionate towards yourself: </strong></span>\u201cThe fact is that most of us will eat more \u2018sometimes\u2019 and \u2018occasional\u2019 food at Christmas time,\u201d says McMahon. \u201cThe best thing to do is to allow yourself this pleasure, enjoy the food and trust that you and your body can handle it.\u201d</p>\r\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>\u00bb Eat mindfully:</strong></span> \u201cWhen you slow down to savour each mouthful of food, you not only enjoy it more, your body and mind connect, so you start to notice when you are full,\u201d says McMahon.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>\u00bb View treats as a temporary detour:</strong></span> Yes, last night you had garlic bread and canap\u00e9s. And today? You\u2019re back on your usual track, eating three healthy meals and healthy snacks.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>\u00bb Plate up your snacks:</strong></span> Even at parties where you can bring a food contribution like sushi and paper plates to serve it on. \u201cThis helps you to see how much you are eating so it is easier to realise when you\u2019ve had enough,\u201d says dietitian and nutritionist Rebecca Gawthorne.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>\u00bb Serve your leftovers to go:</strong></span> If you\u2019ve had friends over for dinner and know you won\u2019t be able to resist the rest of the cheesecake or lasagna, serve it into take-away containers and send your guests home with the leftovers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr class=\"system-pagebreak\" title=\"Christmas game plan\" />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><i>2. Nostalgia</i></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">You Think: \u2018I love fruit pudding, mince pies, White Christmas and the turkey stuffing \u2013 they all remind me of when I was a child and how easy and uncomplicated life was.\u2019</p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong>The Fallout:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">\u201cChristmas foods typically have many layers of emotion attached to them,\u201d says McMahon. \u201cFirstly, some of the foods on offer, such as crackling or Christmas pudding, are things you only eat once a year. This in itself can make the food more desirable.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\">\u201cOften we feel comfort and nostalgia in relation to Christmas food. Unfortunately this can lead us to keep eating more and more to fill an emotional void with food, when in reality, eating that is driven by emotions and not hunger is rarely satiating.\u201d</p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong>Your Christmas Comeback:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>\u00bb Reality check:</strong></span> \u201cAsk yourself<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>\u2018Am I hungry?\u2019 and, in particular, \u2018What am I hungry for?\u2019\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>suggests McMahon. \u201cIf you know that what you really crave is closeness or connection, honour those feelings and respond to them. Talk to your partner or a trusted sibling about your feelings or write them down. Satisfy those emotions but don\u2019t feed them. Ask someone for a hug or do something nostalgic \u2013 look through old photos, or maybe write a journal about your feelings.\u201d</p>\r\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>\u00bb Give old favourite foods a health spin:</strong></span> For example, if you associate Christmas with fizzy drinks, buy some mineral water and add a dash of a colourful juice like grape juice. Or if Christmas chocolate was your favourite thing, still have a little, but make it a handmade dark chocolate so that it looks amazing (and has health benefits for your heart), and only eat two.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>\u00bb Channel your inner child</strong></span>: Engage in some games you used to play as a child rather than hoeing into the food. Try board games such as Scrabble and Monopoly, or charades, or picnic games like tag and stuck in the mud.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p7\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr class=\"system-pagebreak\" title=\"Christmas game plan\" />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><i>3. Using Food To Self-Pamper</i></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">You Think: \u2018I\u2019ve had a really difficult year and I deserve to give myself this reward of lashings of yummy food and wine.\u2019</p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong>The Fallout:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">\u201cUsing food as the ultimate holiday treat puts food on a pedestal, as though it can magically fix everything that\u2019s not working in your life and make you feel better,\u201d says McMahon. Fast-forward a few hours after the chocolates and chips or second serving of dessert and you will still be carrying the same emotional baggage. But now you\u2019ll have some food guilt to add to it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong>Your Christmas Comeback:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>\u00bb Take just a few bites:</strong></span> Serve yourself a little of the foods you wouldn\u2019t normally indulge in but just take a few bites to satisfy you and don\u2019t eat the rest. Or enjoy just a small sliver of dessert. Research from Cornell University shows that people who eat small serves of treat foods feel just as satisfied 15 minutes later as those who ate far bigger portions. Another study at Stanford University has found that people who ate only three salty crackers were more satisfied than those who ate 15 crackers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>\u00bb Seek non-food rewards:</strong></span> Treat yourself to a few great books for Christmas and daily indulgences over the holidays such as enjoying breakfast al fresco or going for a sunset walk with all the family. \u201cRemind yourself that the major perks of Christmas are not the meals but spending time with family and friends and enjoying a break from work,\u201d says McMahon.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>\u00bb Avoid second serves:</strong></span><span class=\"s3\"> Instead, have a tall glass of water or a nice hot cup of tea. If that doesn\u2019t work and you still feel hungry, go back to have a second serve of salad and vegetables.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr class=\"system-pagebreak\" title=\"Christmas game plan\" />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><i>4. Suffering Clean Eating Fatigue</i></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">You Think: \u2018I\u2019m tired of being good. I\u2019m going to feast all through the holidays and work it off at the gym later.\u2019</p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong>The Fallout:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">\u201cGorging yourself during the holidays and thrashing yourself at the gym later is a dangerous trap that perpetuates an unhealthy and disconnected relationship between food and your body,\u201d says McMahon. \u201cA feast and famine kind of approach is not helpful to maintaining a healthy weight.\u201d Losing weight is also a trickier prospect than many people realise so you may find that your holiday weight does not all come off, even if you\u2019re working out hard and eating clean.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Christmas Comeback:</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>\u00bb Stick to your usual eating pattern:</strong></span> \u201cIf you\u2019re eating out, choose the grilled fish and vegies instead of the creamy pasta,\" says Gawthorne. Meanwhile, skip foods you would never normally have, such as soft drinks, bread rolls at dinner, gravy and sour cream on your potatoes.\u201d</p>\r\n<p class=\"p7\">Eating at a friend\u2019s house? Offer to bring a huge salad so that you can serve a big plate of that and eat less of the more kilojoule-laden healthy fare.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>\u00bb Work out as usual: </strong></span>Abandoning your exercise routine at the very time of year that you normally eat more doesn\u2019t make any sense. \u201cExercise makes every cell more sensitive to insulin, so glucose enters your cells more easily,\u201d says Christine Armarego, exercise physiologist from Sydney\u2019s Glucose Club. \u201cThis means your pancreas doesn\u2019t need to send out as much insulin to manage your blood glucose levels.\u201d In turn this helps to reduce weight gain over the festive season.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>\u00bb Remember \u2013 </strong></span>this effect is dose-dependent. \u201cTwenty-four hours after you work out, your insulin sensitivity peaks,\u201d Armarego explains. \u201cWithin 48 hours it has returned to what it was. That\u2019s why daily exercise is best to keep insulin sensitivity at its highest. If you can\u2019t manage that, try not to let more than 48 hours pass between exercise sessions.\u201d</p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s3\">B</span>y contrast, if you\u2019re a couch potato all holidays, \u201cHigher glucose levels and insulin can lead to increased fatigue and make it harder for your body to access fats stores to burn for energy,\u201d Armarego says.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\">So keep up some kind of exercise all through Christmas. And if at all possible, exercise on Christmas day \u2013 either by engaging in a workout after th<span class=\"s3\">e present opening, or by enjoying a long family walk over lunch.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p9\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr class=\"system-pagebreak\" title=\"Christmas game plan\" />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><em><strong>5.&nbsp;</strong></em><i style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Starving to Save Up Kilojoules</i></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">You Think: \u2018I purposely haven\u2019t eaten a thing all day so that I can let my hair down at Christmas lunch.\u2019</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>The Fallout:</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThis is a classic Christmas mistake,\u201d says Gawthorne. \u201cYou are likely to be so ravenous that you serve a huge portion and then go back for seconds, which could cause a huge kilojoule blowout.\u201d</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Christmas Comeback:</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>\u00bb Eat three meals:</strong></span><span class=\"s1\"> Have a simple breakfast of eggs and rye toast and eat a salad for lunch. This will ensure you\u2019re not starving with hunger and supersize your helpings at Christmas functions and then regret it the next day.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>\u00bb Go for vegies first: </strong></span><span class=\"s1\">\u201cServe a stack of salad and vegetables (at least half your plate) first then serve the other foods,\u201d Gawthorne suggests. \u201cThe more vegies you eat, the more nutrients and fibre you enjoy and the less likely you will be to overindulge in other foods. It will also help portion control the other high-kilojoule foods because you will only have a little room for them on your plate.\u201d</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>\u00bb Choose a smaller plate:</strong></span><span class=\"s1\"> Put a larger plate underneath it so it has the illusion of looking even bigger. When you serve your meal, you will feel that you are eating a huge feast even though you are not overdoing your intake of kilojoules.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>\u00bb Pick three favourites: </strong></span><span class=\"s1\">Rather than go for everything from the roast potatoes and gravy to the crackling, pick three favourite high-kilojoule foods to really savour in small portions. Then fill the rest of your plate with super-healthy salads and vegetables.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr class=\"system-pagebreak\" title=\"Christmas Day game plan\" />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><i>6. Using Alcohol to Unwind</i></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">You Think: \u2018That champagne is really giving me a nice buzz after weeks of stress. I\u2019m going to help myself relax by having a few more.\u2019</p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong>The Fallout:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Because it\u2019s a drink, we often completely ignore that alcohol can pack a powerful kilojoule punch. \u201cBeer, wine, spirits and cocktails are all high in calories and devoid of any good nutrition, so there is no nutritional benefit gained from consuming them,\u201d says Gawthorne.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\">\u201cWhile I don\u2019t think there is too much of an issue with consuming small, safe amounts of one to two standard drinks of alcohol on social occasions, it\u2019s important not to look at Christmas and New Year\u2019s as an excuse to drink to excess. This will lead to weight gain and could cause potential health issues (such as hangovers and stomach irritation).\u201d</p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\">Remember, alcohol often comes alongside foods like salty nuts and chips that may be harder to resist once we\u2019ve had a few. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re feeling worse for wear the next day, you may also indulge in a big fatty breakfast,\u201d Gawthorne adds.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong>Christmas Comeback:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>\u00bb Make a trade-off:</strong></span> Decide how you are going to spend your kilojoules before each function. \u201cIf you want to indulge, for example, in a slice of your favourite Christmas cake after dinner, then you won\u2019t want to be drinking lots of alcohol,\u201d Gawthorne says. \u201cOr if you want to enjoy a few alcoholic drinks, then you might need to forgo the dessert or avoid the high-kilojoule cheeses after dinner.\u201d</p>\r\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>\u00bb De-stress without alcohol: </strong></span>Not <span class=\"s2\">only is the lead-up to Christmas rushed and stressed for many people, but being with family is often super stressful too. So take time to stop and recharge your batteries. That may mean you engage in daily meditation, a morning swim or time out to read a book from cover to cover. The less stressed you are and the more enjoyable your Christmas holiday, the less likely you are to use food as a Christmas feelgood crutch.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>NEXT:</strong> Beat the Christmas snacking blowout with these top&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/popular-topics/2136-5-tips-to-stop-the-christmas-snacking-blowout\" target=\"_blank\">tips.&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/healthy-eating/2384-your-christmas-day-feasting-game-plan\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 19 Dec 2017 03:47:40 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/healthy-eating/2384-your-christmas-day-feasting-game-plan</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>5 health benefits of macadamias </title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/healthy-eating/2383-5-health-benefits-of-macadamias</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Macadamias are a rich source of monounsaturated (omega-3) fatty acids and come with a host of health benefits in just one handful.

The pumpkin, blue cheese and coriander combination makes them a classy work lunch option, or the ideal addition to a long and leisurely picnic. But don\u2019t be fooled by their simplicity \u2013 the golden macadamias on top ensure they\u2019re anything but ordinary.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Need:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">300g pumpkin, peeled and cut into 1cm pieces</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">2 tsp oil</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">450g pack store-bought short-crust pastry</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">2 eggs</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00bc cup thickened cream</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">50g blue cheese, crumbled</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00bc cup coriander leaves, chopped, or chives if you prefer</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00bc cup macadamia halves</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Do:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">1. Preheat oven to 180\u00b0C.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">2. Place the pumpkin pieces on a small tray and drizzle with oil. Roast for 15 minutes, or until just soft.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">3. Place pastry on a lightly floured work surface and cut out 6 x 14cm rounds, to fit tartlet tins. You may have slightly smaller or larger tins, so cut according to your size. Press the pastry circles into the tins.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">4. Cut 6 rounds of baking paper to line the pastry. Line the pastry and weight with pastry weights or an appropriate weight \u2013 rice or dried chickpeas work well. Bake for 5\u20137 minutes, remove from the oven and set aside to cool slightly. Remove the baking paper and weights.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">5. Whisk together the eggs and cream. Pour the egg mixture into the empty tart shell so that it comes halfway up the sides. Divide the pumpkin and blue cheese between the tarts and sprinkle with coriander. Dot with macadamia halves and return to the oven for a further 5\u20137 minutes, until puffed and golden.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">6.

Best of all, the super-easy, blend-and-bake recipe means you can whip up a batch in no time and hit the picnic rug sooner!</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Need:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00bc cup wholemeal flour</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00bc cup oats</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00bd cup macadamias</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">2 tbsp poppy seeds</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">2 tbsp sunflower seeds</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">2 tbsp sesame seeds</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">3 tbsp water</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Do:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">1. Preheat oven to 180\u00b0C.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">2. Place all the ingredients except the water in a blender. Blend until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. Note that many of the sesame seeds and all the poppy seeds will still be whole.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">3. With the motor running, add the water a tablespoon at a time until the mixture comes together and forms a ball. Place the ball on a sheet of baking paper that will line a baking tray.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">4. Flatten the ball to a rectangle about 1cm thick. Place a large piece of plastic wrap over the flattened mixture and roll out to a 2mm thick rectangle with a rolling pin. Remove the plastic wrap and use a ruler and knife, or a pasta cutter, to score the flattened dough to create small, cracker sized rectangles.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">5. Transfer the dough and baking paper to a tray and bake for 8\u201310 minutes, until the edges have started to go golden and the inner areas are cooked. Remove and cool for 5 minutes on the tray before gently breaking into pieces along the score lines and transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Modelling was on the back foot due to my basketball and school commitments but it\u2019s now something I would love to do full time. I did M-Active\u2019s second campaign in the middle of this year and the concept and styles they have created was something I loved. Being someone who lives and breathes fitness, they thought I fit their brand image perfectly.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What\u2019s it like to represent Australia in basketball in an international championship? </strong></p>\r\n<p>Representing your country in any aspect is an absolute honour and I was lucky enough to do it several times. It\u2019s demanding and a big commitment that requires a lot of work. I spent every day in the gym getting fitter and stronger and on the basketball court improving my shot and ball handling and training with my team. Physically, you have to push through so many barriers and look to the end goal knowing it\u2019ll all be worth it.</p>\r\n<p>I discovered the benefits of boxing a few years ago, which allows me to zone out and to push to another level, and I believe this has given me a mental edge in not only sport but in everything in life. Playing sport at such a high level was hard for me because I didn\u2019t really have a lot of time to spend with friends and family, but everyone understood that these were some of the sacrifices I had to make in order to be competitive.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What is it like to compete at that level as a female and at such a young age?<br /> </strong>I can\u2019t even describe it \u2013 it was something I worked hard for, for so long. So many times I wanted to quit because it didn\u2019t happen. Being away from home for weeks at a time gets tough (especially because I\u2019m such a homebody), but my teammates and coaches became my second family. We achieved incredible wins together, taking home two gold medals at the Pacific Youth Championships and bronze at the World Championships in Russia.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How do you keep fit and healthy? </strong></p>\r\n<p>A lot of people think my training schedule is crazy but it\u2019s always been like this for me. I train in the morning at around 5\u20135:30am, doing high intensity cardio and strength work at either F45 or Tribute Boxing &amp; Fitness. When I\u2019m not working, I practise Pilates or shoot a ball during my study break, and in the afternoon I train again or shoot ball.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What does your day on a plate look like?</strong></p>\r\n<p>I start every morning with a pre-workout and make sure I stay hydrated with plenty of water. But nothing happens until I\u2019ve had my morning coffee!</p>\r\n<p>I love smoothies or juices for breakfast as they allow me to consume extra nutrients and it\u2019s an easy way to get more vegetables in for the day. Lunch and dinner are usually a source of protein such as chicken, steak or salmon with a salad or vegetables.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout the day I love to snack on nuts or a protein ball.</p>\r\n<p>On weekends I usually go out for brunch with the girls after a workout and have scrambled eggs on sourdough bread with all the sides!</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://m-active.com.au/\"><strong>M-Active</strong></a><strong> is a good example of a brand offering on-trend activewear that can be worn in the gym or down the street. What are the key features of the M-Active range that make it a pleasure to train in?&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n<p>M-Active has done an amazing job at capturing all aspects of the market. I\u2019m someone who loves to wear black or dark colours to the gym, and I love that their range offers these muted shades with just a touch of colour for those who like to keep it more subtle. All the M-Active tights and crops are so flattering for a woman\u2019s body \u2013 they hold you in and make you feel secure while complementing your natural curves.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What are the key design elements of the M-Active range that you think contribute to its aesthetic appeal and sets it apart from others in the market? </strong></p>\r\n<p>The \u2018seamless free\u2019 range is a winner for me because I travel a lot and want to feel comfortable \u2013 they\u2019re super comfy and easy to move in. I also love their \u2018everyday wear\u2019 range \u2013 everything from mid-length dresses to jackets \u2013 which you can wear to brunch, out shopping or to work, but are made out of the same fabrics as their active range. Again, comfort is my number one priority when it comes to clothing.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What\u2019s your biggest tip for staying healthy during the holiday period? </strong></p>\r\n<p>Be mindful of what you\u2019re eating and drinking but don\u2019t stress about it too much. During the holidays I train every morning, whether it\u2019s a HIIT session, weight training, Pilates or a long run or power walk with my mum, because it allows us to set good intentions for the day. Enjoy the little time you get to relax and know that once the new year arrives, it\u2019s time to whip back into gear!</p>\r\n<p>Step out in style and shop M-Active gear <a href=\"https://m-active.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2382-fitness-and-training-talk-with-m-active-ambassador-montana-farrah-seaton\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2017 00:45:05 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2382-fitness-and-training-talk-with-m-active-ambassador-montana-farrah-seaton</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>Full story: talking body confidence with cover models Georgia Gibbs and Kate Wasley</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2378-full-story-talking-body-confidence-with-cover-models-georgia-gibbs-and-kate-wasley</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Thunder thighs. Mum tum. Tuckshop lady arms. Far from a biological predisposition, our modern tendency to criticise parts of our own body is instead an ugly by-product of a media-saturated world. Something that the October 2018 cover models and founders of body-love movement, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/any.body_co/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">AnyBODY</a>, are on a mission to change.</strong> </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"s1\">West-Aussie models and body confidence activists Georgia Gibbs and Kate Wasley sat down with us to talk the impact of social media, health at any size and beauty with no boundaries. Because \u2013 in the words of <i>WH&amp;F</i> \u2013 it\u2019s not a look, it\u2019s a lifestyle. Katelyn Swallow and David Goding tell their story.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On the 23<sup>rd</sup> of January 2017, 22-year-old Aussie model Georgia Gibbs posted an innocent Instagram photo of herself and fellow model and friend Kate Wasley, 23, posed in front of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. A few minutes later, the image was bombarded with negative comments about their differing body sizes, along with accusations of image tampering.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cPeople were calling me anorexic and Kate fat, and assuming I had Photoshopped my friend bigger to make me look \u2018better\u2019. It was really upsetting for us both and so against everything we believe in,\u201d says Gibbs, who started modelling at the age of 16 in her home city of Perth.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cAnd so our brand, AnyBODY, was born shortly after.\u201d</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Launched on the 8<sup>th</sup> of March 2017 \u2013 appropriately, International Women\u2019s Day \u2013 the @any.body_co Instagram account had over 5000 followers by close of business day one, and clocked over 20,000 followers after the first 10 days. Today, more than 206,000 follow Gibbs and Wasley, who post professional images of themselves, selfies of women with varied body shapes, inspirational quotes about self-love, and healthy living and beauty tips. AnyBODY has also provided the girls with a host of dual modelling contracts for big brands such as Cotton On Body and Cooper Street.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Wasley attributes the brand\u2019s rapid success to a public and industry that craved body diversity \u2013 and a marketable icon to represent it.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI can\u2019t believe how fast AnyBODY blew up! Although [Georgia] and I are really only two people of different sizes, I truly believe that incorporating a range of sizes, races and genders in advertising and across social media will help thousands of women worldwide when it comes to feeling comfortable in their own skin,\u201d says Wasley, who began her modeling career in 2015 after being discovered by a local model search.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe decided to preach to people that healthy <i>can </i>come in a range of sizes. Because of the way social media is these days, I think a lot of women lose perspective on what body diversity is. I think a lot of people get sucked into believing that you should look a certain way, be a certain size, and have no cellulite or stretch marks. It\u2019s unrealistic and we want that to change.\u201d</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The media\u2019s negative influence on people\u2019s \u2013 particularly women\u2019s \u2013 body image isn\u2019t a recent concern. According to psychotherapist Natajsa Wagner, media influence can be traced back to illustrations from the 1930s that depicted women with curves, while the \u201940s and \u201950s saw the female bust and glutes become the focus.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cMattel created the Barbie doll with unachievable and disproportionate body parts, and in 1966, in the environment of an emerging super-media, we had the world\u2019s first supermodel in Twiggy. She was a sharp contrast to Marilyn Monroe, and over time we learnt that thin was the new \u2018ideal\u2019 body image. So, although women come in all shapes and sizes, the overarching truth is that only one type of body is [portrayed as] \u2018ideal\u2019,\u201d says Wagner.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">By the age of 17, women have experienced a quarter of a million beauty- and body-</span>oriented advertisements, and continue to be exposed to an average of 400 to 600 depictions of \u2018beauty\u2019 every day. The emergence of the smartphone and social media platforms puts these images in our pockets, and the way we engage with social media makes these often digitally altered and filtered depictions seem all the more \u2018real\u2019. According to research by Trilogy, six out of 10 women believe that people expect online photos to have been retouched or have a filter applied, yet 61 per cent of Australian women do not see the use of a filter as a form of retouching. Additionally, one 2014 study published in <i>Body Image</i> found a direct correlation between poor self-image and the number of hours spent trawling Facebook, due to body comparisons with peers and celebrities alike.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Dr John Demartini, author of <i>The Gratitude Effect</i>, believes our tendency to compare and judge our own body based on individuals who we deem more \u2018attractive\u2019 is the primary cause of negative self-perception. \u201cIn today\u2019s social media-obsessed world, many people feel pressured to pursue a physical, one-sided, false perfection that is simply unattainable,\u201d he says.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">In other words, it\u2019s not a biologically determined position to think of our body negatively; rather, our body image is influenced by a range of outside factors, fuelled by a visually obsessed (and self-obsessed) society. For Wasley, this tendency to compare herself to others led to a host of mental and physical issues in her younger \u2013 and leaner \u2013 years. While now sitting happily at a comfortable size 16, at her thinnest (size 10/12) she was mentally exhausted.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cFor me, my biggest barriers [to a positive body image] were comparing myself to others, whether that be my friends or \u2018fitspo\u2019 girls I followed on social media. I had such an unrealistic idea of what I should look like and that resulted in not feeling good enough or worthy of love,\u201d she says.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cI stopped going out with friends because I had such bad anxiety about food and alcohol. I didn\u2019t want to be seen as the \u2018fat\u2019 friend \u2013 although, looking back now, I was very fit and toned. It\u2019s amazing how you see yourself when you feel insecure; my view of my own body was totally warped. If I can help even one person work their way out of that mindset, I\u2019ll feel accomplished.\u201d</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Gibbs expresses a similar memory of juvenile body dysmorphia.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cI remember being 16 and being unsure of who I was, being unhappy with how I looked and spending so much time comparing myself to other people. It really ruined my ability to love myself for all my other talents outside of physical appearance. Barriers to my own self-love definitely came from setting unachievable goals \u2013 such as wanting to look like a celebrity who was the complete opposite to me, therefore setting myself up to fail \u2013 and comparing myself to others on social media,\u201d she says.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">An extension of the same debate is the complex interplay of health, genetics and lifestyle on how the body appears \u2013 especially considering Australia\u2019s worsening obesity epidemic, not to mention the ever-increasing occurrence of eating disorders. Gibbs\u2019 mother was a personal trainer and her father a CrossFit instructor, so healthy food and exercise were integrated into her life from an early age \u2013 but both were seen as tools for optimal performance rather than to create a particular body shape. Early in her modelling career, however, Gibbs\u2019 naturally curvaceous silhouette and muscular lower body were often criticised by an industry set on slim.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m predisposed to having a small waist, bigger quads and broad shoulders. But through training, these features are definitely exaggerated and other areas built on and changed too,\u201d says Gibbs.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ve always had to overcome hurdles about my appearance. But over the last few years \u2013 as I\u2019ve built a brand around myself of wellness and self-acceptance \u2013 it\u2019s been amazing to see clients accept me for who I am and now embrace the \u2018love AnyBODY\u2019 message.\u201d</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Wasley, on the other hand, comes from a paternal line of tall and built physiques, and first became conscious of her health at age 17.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI was never self-conscious [growing up]. I knew I was on the bigger side, but I honestly didn\u2019t have a problem with it until I started to compare myself to other girls. Maybe it was about the same time I became interested in boys\u2026who knows. But I remember not having a clue where to start,\u201d she says.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve finally reached a place of contentment and balance, which I\u2019m truly grateful for! I eat healthy and exercise, and I\u2019m a size 16, and I feel if I were to stop [exercising and eating well] completely, I\u2019d maybe sit at a size 16/18 naturally \u2013 but my body would look different, if that makes sense.\u201d</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The World Health Organization defines health as \u201ca state of complete physical, mental, and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\u201d \u2013 a sentiment the AnyBODY team echo. Gibbs and Wasley encourage women to see good health as encompassing the physical, the mental and the spiritual. It\u2019s about balance, the ability to move freely and think clearly, and it\u2019s highly individual.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cHealth is <i>so</i> much more than your physical fitness,\u201d says Wasley. \u201cTo an extent, I don\u2019t believe you can judge how healthy a person is based on their weight and physical being. For example, when I was at my thinnest, people were asking me left right and centre for fitness advice; I suddenly became the \u2018fit friend\u2019, running 10km multiple times a week and avoiding alcohol. If you looked at me, I was the picture of health. But what no one knew was that I was dealing with disordered eating, I was isolating myself from social events and my friends, and I was so miserable and hated how I looked. I wasn\u2019t healthy at all.\u201d</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>WH&amp;F </i>head trainer and Creating Curves founder, Alexa Towersey, agrees.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cAs a society, we need to redefine what we think \u2018healthy\u2019 looks like. The reality of the situation is that body dysmorphia exists at both ends of the spectrum.&nbsp;We naively live under the assumption that a size 10 is making healthier choices than a size 16 based solely on their appearance, and without even taking into consideration age, ethnicity, genetic makeup or hormonal profile.&nbsp; It\u2019s the underlying relationship with food and exercise \u2013 whether it\u2019s positive or negative \u2013 that we should be paying attention to,\u201d she says.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Toeing the line between adopting a positive body image and striving to reach your health and fitness goals is not always easy. But for the AnyBODY brand and for a fair chunk of body image experts, striving for physical change isn\u2019t necessarily a negative thing; wanting to create a healthier, fitter body that exudes confidence can be a noble goal and set you on a journey that invigorates, rather than sabotages, your self-esteem. The important thing is to understand <i>why</i> you are wanting to change, says Wagner.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe\u2019ve all experienced feeling uncomfortable in our bodies: we know when we feel physically fit, healthy and comfortable in our clothes and we know when we don\u2019t. Wanting to make changes to positively impact our health isn\u2019t wrong,\u201d she says.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cHowever, when you start to define your level of self-worth and value by how you believe your body should look, the desire to improve your body or work towards a better level of health has gone too far. Do it for the endorphins; do it because you\u2019re looking after your body and challenging yourself. There is a huge amount of research now that shows exercise to be one of the most uplifting tools we have and makes us feel good about our current body shape.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cA <i>positive</i> body image means a person is able to accept their body as it is with respect and admiration. Living with a positive body image means you have the ability to utilise your own self-esteem, maintain a positive attitude and are emotionally stable. Because of this, you\u2019re able to filter through the messages from the media, your peers and family, and remain steadfast in how you feel about your body.\u201d</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">While Wasley and Gibbs admit they\u2019ve had to work hard to become body-positive, the duo hope the AnyBODY brand can help more women accept their appearance and feel empowered in their journey to good health; and, for them, this starts with a greater diversity of body shapes and sizes being represented on the catwalk, in advertising, in clothing sizes and in the media. Already, key brands have taken their cue, with Cooper Street releasing their \u2018curve range\u2019 inspired by the movement. Future plans for AnyBODY centre on launching their Skype for Schools program, tackling teenagers\u2019 self-esteem, body confidence and personal development issues, while Wasley is looking to one day complete her Health Promotion degree to further advance the cause. But, in the interim, both Gibbs and Wasley offer one piece of solid advice: quit the comparisons and learn to love you \u2013 for you.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cToday I feel fantastic about my body the majority of the time. I still have my bad days because, well, I\u2019m human \u2013 but they\u2019re now few and far between. I think it\u2019s the way I deal with it now that has been my biggest achievement. I focus on things I love about myself instead of dwelling on what I dislike. I have health and fitness goals now rather than weight or size goals,\u201d says Wasley.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cLoving your body is an individual journey that\u2019s completely different for everyone. But my top tip is not to compare yourself to anyone \u2013 especially on social media \u2013 because often you\u2019ll be comparing yourself at your worst to someone at their best. Just remember you <i>are</i> worthy of love, no matter what you look like. There are people out there that love you for you, and don\u2019t give a crap about what you look like. Those are the people worth keeping around.\u201d</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">ALL FEATURE photography:<a href=\"https://cottonon.com/AU/cottononbody/\" target=\"_blank\"> Cotton ON Body</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2378-full-story-talking-body-confidence-with-cover-models-georgia-gibbs-and-kate-wasley\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2017 00:32:57 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2378-full-story-talking-body-confidence-with-cover-models-georgia-gibbs-and-kate-wasley</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>Keep it real with fitness blogger Lauren Patterson</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2377-keep-it-real-with-fitness-blogger-lauren-patterson</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>We caught up with solo mummy, personal trainer, gym manager and blogger <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/___laurenkate/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Lauren Patterson</a> to talk about how she keeps fit and healthy and feeling comfortable in your own skin.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>ON INSTAGRAM</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">I partied hard as a teenager and battled severe mental illness until the age of 22 when I fell pregnant with my first child. I began my Instagram account when Madi was a baby to post photos, but had no idea how to use it. I shared my journey of my first fitness modelling competition and straight after I fell pregnant with Max, which is when my following started to grow \u2013 perhaps people wanted to see how much weight I\u2019d put on after doing a comp?</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">I began blogging shortly after falling pregnant, being honest about my struggles with mental illness. After going through hell in my first pregnancy, I wanted a way to vent my emotions, not thinking anyone would read it, but they did. I soon began writing for parenting websites and fitness magazines \u2013 my relatable and honest content gelled with audiences, which I loved!</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>ON KEEPING IT REAL</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">There\u2019s no point in painting a perfect picture when it\u2019s unrealistic. There\u2019s a way to be positive while still remaining relatable and honest about your struggles, which is what I do. I have body hang-ups just like anyone, yet I am often slammed because of the way I look. I\u2019ve always been honest on my social media because it\u2019s okay to feel and look the way you do, and be who you are!</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>ON BODY IMAGE</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Social media can be both good and bad, it all depends on the person on the receiving end\u2019s mindset. I don\u2019t post photos of myself with just a sports bra and tights often, but when I do it can go two ways: women either congratulate me for embracing the way I look or I\u2019ll be slammed for looking this way after having two kids. But captions allow me to share the story behind each photo.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>ON FEELING COMFORTABLE IN YOUR OWN SKIN</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Comparison is the thief of joy. You can have \u2018body goals\u2019, but remember your body is your own, so treat it with respect and be good to it from the inside out and it will reward you by feeling amazing. Embrace who you are \u2013 often, by looking after your mind, your body follows suit.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>ON KEEPING FIT AND HEALTHY</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">My day revolves around keeping fit and healthy \u2013 it\u2019s a lifestyle. The kids keep me on my toes and so does being at the gym and outdoors, plus I make sure our asses aren\u2019t parked on the couch! We eat well but live a balanced lifestyle \u2013 if I feel like a burger or a drink with friends, I do it!</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">I meditate daily, read and practise mindfulness. And doing yoga and Pilates daily has changed my body and mind incredibly.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">MY DAY ON A PLATE</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Starter:</strong></span> tummy tea to ease bloating and get my digestive system kicking.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Brekky:</strong></span> oats (often my first of two because I get up so early!)</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Lunch: </strong></span>normally some sort of protein and vegies, rice or quinoa with homemade sauce.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Dinner:</strong></span> something the kids will enjoy, which I sneakily make healthy, such as broth and noodles with loads of vegies. If we feel like takeaway I\u2019ll make a healthy homemade version!</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Snack time:</strong></span> I\u2019m not a snack person, so I eat bigger meals to keep me fuelled throughout the day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Check out her Instagram page for more inspiration <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/___laurenkate/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2377-keep-it-real-with-fitness-blogger-lauren-patterson\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2017 00:24:33 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2377-keep-it-real-with-fitness-blogger-lauren-patterson</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>7 ways to stay active on your holiday</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2376-7-ways-to-stay-active-on-your-holiday</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">The holiday season is finally here, meaning you might find yourself spending less time at the squat rack and more time by the pool sipping on pina coladas.&nbsp;</span><span class=\"s1\">The solution?</span><span class=\"s2\"> Book your fitness escape to beautiful (and affordable) <a href=\"https://www.tourismthailand.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Thailand</a> and get ready for a host of fun-filled activities that will get your heart rate up in between soaking up rays \u2013 no treadmill required.</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> WIth Australia\u2019s Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines recommending two-and a-half hours of moderate-intensity activity per week to help prevent weight gain, it\u2019s important to find ways to have your cocktail and keep active too.

The area is renowned for its picturesque limestone cliffs set against a white sandy beach and dark blue ocean. Pure bliss.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">If you love <strong>snorkelling</strong> and <strong>scuba diving</strong> \u2013 or would love to give it a go \u2013 Thailand is the place to do it. With clear turquoise seawater, magnificent coral reefs and an exceptional diversity of marine life, it\u2019s no wonder the region is often referred to as \u2018the diver\u2019s heaven\u2019. The peninsula of Southern Thailand stretches between two oceans, allowing diving in Thailand to be possible all year round. The Gulf of Thailand is suitable for diving trips from April to October and the best period for diving in the Andaman Sea is from November to April.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Kayaking</strong> in Thailand is an amazing way to see spectacular scenery. Whether by sea or river, you\u2019ll paddle over crystal-clear water under a tropical sun while exploring diverse countryside, a verdant jungle, limestone cliffs, intricate sea caves and mangrove swamps. Koh Phangan is the ultimate paradise to explore. The island offers beautiful hidden coves and beaches \u2013 a sight for sore eyes while you work your arm muscles manoeuvring the kayak.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Cycling</strong> is a fun way to discover the natural wonders, cultural treasures and unique ways of life of Thailand. Getting your heart rate up with some steady-state cardio while experiencing the Thai culture sounds like the ultimate workout for an adventure seeker. Some sensational cycling routes include:</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>\u00bb&nbsp;</strong></span>Sam Praeng community in Bangkok</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>\u00bb&nbsp;</strong></span>The bike route along the Chao Phraya River on the Thonburi side</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>\u00bb&nbsp;</strong></span>Ayutthaya World Heritage bike route</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>\u00bb&nbsp;</strong></span>Sukhothai World Heritage bike route</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">If you\u2019re a bit of a thrillseeker, you won\u2019t pass up gliding down the <strong>zipline</strong> through a rainforest canopy. But safety first, of course \u2013 you\u2019ll be harnessed safely on either the wooden walking platforms or the ziplines.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Head over to <a href=\"https://www.tourismthailand.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Tourism Thailand</a> for the best places to visit and explore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>This piece was produced in partnership with Tourism Thailand.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2376-7-ways-to-stay-active-on-your-holiday\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 05 Dec 2017 03:57:32 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2376-7-ways-to-stay-active-on-your-holiday</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>Chocolate mint smoothie recipe</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/recipe-finder/2372-chocolate-mint-smoothie-recipe</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Get your protein fix with this chocolate mint smoothie courtesy of our friends at Activated Nutrients.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Ingredients</strong> (makes one smoothie)</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"p4\">1 scoop <a href=\"https://activatednutrients.com/products/raw-cacao-daily-protein1\" target=\"_blank\">Activated Nutrients Daily Protein Raw Cacao</a></li>\r\n<li class=\"p4\">1 ripe banana</li>\r\n<li class=\"p4\">2 tbsp cacao powder</li>\r\n<li class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s3\">1 cup milk of choice (</span>almond, soy, dairy, etc.)</li>\r\n<li class=\"p4\">\u00bd cup frozen blueberries</li>\r\n<li class=\"p4\">10 mint leaves (plus a few more to garnish)</li>\r\n<li class=\"p4\">1 tbsp cacao nibs to garnish (optional but does add a brilliant crunch!)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Method</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">1.

My writing has always focused on women and their bodies, minds and fitness.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Fitness has been a major part of my life from a young age, but at about 17 I went down an extreme dieting road that led to binge/purge eating habits and anorexia. The gym became an outlet for me and a place where I could feel some sense of control amidst deep body image issues. Now, I love lifting weights and feeling strong and this year I competed in my first powerlifting competition.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I also coach 25 women. It\u2019s the most satisfying thing to help women to get stronger and feel better and more confident. This is also what my Instagram is all about.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>ON KEEPING IT REAL</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">There\u2019s a lot of misleading information on the Internet. I would look at many beautiful, seemingly flawless women on social media and wonder why they didn\u2019t talk about their relationships with themselves and with food or the bad days. We all face issues surrounding body image, our sense of self, confidence and feeling inadequate, and one day I decided to talk about it. My honesty was well received, with people around the world telling me I had made them feel less alone. Connection and honesty are my two highest values and I get to satisfy them every day.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>ON BODY IMAGE</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">You need to remind yourself that you\u2019re looking at a highlight reel.<strong> </strong>The gorgeous chick you\u2019re double tapping on the \u2019gram likely faces her own worries and issues. Life isn\u2019t always rosy, and many photos are taken by a photographer on a beach, involving sand in hair and eyes, and Photoshop.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Every crease, freckle, fold, line, wrinkle, curve and dimple is all yours and all beautiful \u2013 that\u2019s your power.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>ON FEELING COMFORTABLE IN YOUR OWN SKIN</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If we could accept that we are enough in every way, it would be a different world. It\u2019s not about resting your laurels or never working hard because you\u2019re already good enough, but about accepting yourself, including your imperfections.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>ON KEEPING FIT AND HEALTHY</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I lift weights, eat well and spend time outside as much as I can. I feel the best when I\u2019m strong, cardiovascularly fit and flexible, so my training doesn\u2019t focus on just squatting, deadlifting and benching like a typical powerlifting split. I like to run, jump, spin, handstand and make sure I\u2019m strong unilaterally too.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">MY DAY ON A </span><span class=\"s2\">PLATE</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Every day is different, depending on how organised I am that week. I try to advocate against comparing your day on a plate to anybody else\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s no magic combination of foods that is going to result in health and happiness.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">I track macros and use flexible dieting principles. I think the best daily diet you can stick to is one that allows spontaneity and sustainability. If you\u2019re restricted to 1000 calories and two food groups, I can\u2019t see long-term success.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2370-keeping-fit-and-healthy-with-bec-louise-chambers\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2017 23:25:28 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2370-keeping-fit-and-healthy-with-bec-louise-chambers</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title> Win an Amazonia Raw Acai Skin Active Liquid this summer</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/competitions/2367-win-an-amazonia-raw-acai-skin-active-liquid-this-summer</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"intro\">Shine brighter with <a href=\"http://www.amazonia.com.au/raw-acai-skin-active\" target=\"_blank\">Amazonia Raw Acai Skin Active </a>Liquid this summer!</p>\r\n<p>You'll also go into the draw to win a three-month digital subscription to Women's Health and Fitness magazine.</p>\r\n<p>To enter:<br />\u2022 Follow&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/whandfmag/\">@whandfmag</a><br />\u2022 Follow&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/amazoniaco/\">@amazoniaco</a><br />\u2022 Post your selfie, #RawFitspo and tag @whandfmag</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: 6.75pt; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Terms &amp; Conditions for Rawfitspo competition</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">1.

This stopped when I left school, and I didn\u2019t actually start actively working out until January 2016 when I downloaded the Sweat With Kayla app. There\u2019s a mix of factors that contributed to my social media following: a few of my posts went viral on online news publications, my transformation photos garner a lot of followers each week, and (hopefully!) I motivate and inspire people to work out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>ON KEEPING IT REAL</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">I constantly felt put down when scrolling through my Instagram feed. Seeing image after image of perfection, I wondered if people felt the same way going through their feeds, and whether my photos contributed. So I decided to share more pictures that were honest and relatable. I receive a lot of comments from people saying it\u2019s their goal to have my body, and I want people to know I have flaws just like everyone. We\u2019re so used to seeing perfect pictures of women in our feeds that it\u2019s nice to see a bit of real life sometimes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>ON BODY IMAGE</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">I think because people view social media influencers as being more \u2018real life\u2019 than the touched up celebrities in magazines, social media is very influential when it comes to body image. However, Instagram is now just the same because it\u2019s easy to smooth out your cellulite or reshape your body. I think the problem is even worse as we compare ourselves more to these unattainable images of perfection. And instead of a magazine, which you have to physically go to the shop and buy, you have these images in your pocket and accessible at all times.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>ON KEEPING FIT AND HEALTHY</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">I find it easier to stick to a routine, so I make sure I go to the gym first thing in the morning, no matter how I\u2019m feeling or how busy I am. I make healthy food choices when I buy food from the supermarket (if it\u2019s not in my cupboard, I don\u2019t eat it!), but I also make sure I don\u2019t restrict myself too heavily so I don\u2019t blow out on the weekend.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>ON FEELING COMFORTABLE IN YOUR OWN SKIN</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Always remember that the images you see are carefully selected, filtered, angled and lit to display people in the best possible light. Don\u2019t let somebody\u2019s perfect selfie dictate your confidence \u2013 most people don\u2019t actually look how they do on Instagram. If someone is making you feel bad about your body, unfollow them. Follow women that make you feel confident, who are open about their bodies and don\u2019t follow the conventional standards of beauty.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">My day on a </span><span class=\"s2\">plate</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Pre-workout:</strong> protein shake</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Post-workout:</strong> warm oats, berries and apple porridge&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Snack:</strong> toast with peanut butter or Philadelphia cheese</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Lunch:</strong> paprika chicken with green vegies and yoghurt&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Snack:</strong> carrots and avocado dip&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Dinner: </strong>vegetable patty and lentil curry</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Dessert: </strong>chocolate chip cookies</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2364-madalin-frodsham-on-body-image-and-healthy-living\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2017 06:06:18 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2364-madalin-frodsham-on-body-image-and-healthy-living</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>Top stress management techniques</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/health-beauty/health-advice/2363-top-stress-management-techniques</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"intro\">Learn how to cope with stress by eating healthy and taking a closer look at your nutrition.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe right diet is crucial for managing&nbsp;stress,\u201d says&nbsp;</span>health coach and wellness blogger Nic <span class=\"s1\">Makim.&nbsp;\u201cEat regularly and consume yoghurt and low-fat milk to boost your calcium levels and settle your nerves. If you have an intolerance to dairy, make sure you\u2019re getting enough calcium and magnesium from other food&nbsp;sources.&nbsp;Chamomile tea is an age-old tonic to relax and soothe \u2013 you may also want to consult a naturopath about herbal support to help decrease the impact of stress on your brain and body.\u201d</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Eating right will supercharge your body\u2019s natural immune and healing systems, and exercising regularly goes a long way too. Breathing, meditation and visualisation exercises can help you let go of anxieties, and there is strong evidence to suggest that yoga therapy and meditation help reduce stress and its associated symptoms.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">A 2014 study&nbsp;published in<i>&nbsp;JAMA Internal Medicine </i>found that mindful meditation can help ease psychological stresses such as anxiety, depression and fatigue, and therapeutic yoga programs were also shown to reduce markers of stress and inflammation.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">More importantly, recognise that some stress is inevitable. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIf you have unproductive worries, try to remember that as much as we may strive to, we are never going to rid our lives of stress entirely,\u201d says Dr Lishman. \u201cStress is a vital part of being alive. In fact, without feeling&nbsp;stressed&nbsp;now and again, we would be so carefree and blas\u00e9 about everything that we would have been killed off years ago! It\u2019s not stress&nbsp;itself that matters; it\u2019s what you do with it that counts.\u201d</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The symptoms that we associate with a&nbsp;stressful&nbsp;lifestyle such as sleep deprivation, social isolation, weight gain and major depression are all associated with higher rates of heart disease. It is clear, therefore, that finding effective stress&nbsp;management strategies is essential to our overall health and wellbeing.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>However, don\u2019t stress about it! Just concentrate on the following:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"p2\">eat nourishing foods to meet the nutritional demands of the body</li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\">exercise regularly to naturally reduce your cortisol levels</li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\">unplug from digital devices when you need to chill out</li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\">pay active attention to your emotions</li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\">distinguish between problem-solving thoughts and the unproductive ones that simply make your mind race faster</li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\">disengage, but don\u2019t detach from your feelings</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">Find a balance between rest and activity, and create a maintainable chill-out routine for when you get home to prioritise calm and relaxation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">\u201cTuning in to your beautiful body is always at the top of my agenda with all my clients,\u201d says Makim. \u201cI\u2019m also loving this whole mindfulness trend at the moment. Less judgement and negativity and more acceptance and appreciation go a long way towards managing&nbsp;stress&nbsp;and life in general.\u201d&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">In other words, when you\u2019re stressed you\u2019re unable to function at your full potential, so make time for yourself. We can\u2019t stress that strongly enough.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/health-beauty/health-advice/2363-top-stress-management-techniques\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2017 05:21:17 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/health-beauty/health-advice/2363-top-stress-management-techniques</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>Raw caramel slice with \u2018shortbread\u2019 base</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/recipe-finder/2362-raw-caramel-slice-with-shortbread-base</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Whether your sweet tooth needs a</strong> <strong>3 pm fix or you\u2019re looking for something delicious to serve the gals over afternoon tea, we\u2019ve got you sorted.</strong></p>\r\n<p>This low-sugar caramel slice courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/healthsynergy/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Health Synergy </a>is a refined sugar-free and vegan alternative that\u2019s just as tasty (if not more) as the high-sugar version.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Ingredients</strong> (makes 12)</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Shortbread</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s1\">\u00bd cup buckinis, ground to a flour</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s1\">\u00bc cup cashews, ground to a flour</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s1\">\u2153 cup desiccated coconut</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s1\">2\u00bd tbsp coconut butter or coconut oil, melted</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s1\">1 tbsp coconut nectar</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s1\">2\u20133 tbsp boiling water</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Caramel</strong></span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s1\">1 cup medjool dates, pitted (soak in warm water for a few minutes to soften)</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s1\">1 cup raw cashews</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s1\">\u00bc cup coconut butter or coconut oil, melted</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s1\">\u00bc cup hot water</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s1\">1 tbsp hulled tahini</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s1\">1 tbsp mesquite powder, optional</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s1\">1 tsp vanilla bean powder</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s1\">\u00bc tsp Himalayan salt</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Chocolate</strong></span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s1\">100 grams raw dark chocolate (we use Loving Earth 85%)</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Method</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">1.

We have so many plans for the future so it\u2019s an extremely exciting time. Prior to starting Stylerunner, I was working for a tech start-up in Europe.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>ON MY DEFINITION OF SUCCESS</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Defining success is a bit of a trap that some people fall into. For me, success should include a number of elements to ensure you are really seeing the whole picture. The fact that I am working for myself, feel challenged every day and have a great team around me makes me feel more successful than any amount of money could ever achieve.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>ON MY TOP THREE SUCCESS TIPS</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Prioritise your work better:</strong></span><span class=\"s1\"> focus on what\u2019s <i>important</i> not what\u2019s urgent.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Exercise before work rather than after it:</strong></span> you will activate your brain, meaning you will be more alert and effective by the time you hit the office.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Read more professional books:</strong></span> I am a sucker for an inspiring paperback and find that I gain so much new knowledge through learning about the experiences of others. It\u2019s also a great way to keep you motivated and rest your eyes from our digital world. Set a goal of one book per month to start with.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>ON MY MENTOR</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">I have a number of mentors that I am lucky enough to consistently learn from \u2013 old bosses, investors and even my sister Jasna. It\u2019s important to ask for advice when you need it. It\u2019s impossible to know everything but it <i>is</i> possible to learn most things.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"http://www.stylerunner.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Stylerunner.com</i></span></a> // <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/juliestevanja/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">@juliestevanja</a> // <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stylerunner/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">@stylerunner</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2360-stylerunner-s-julie-stevanja-on-success\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2017 03:52:08 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2360-stylerunner-s-julie-stevanja-on-success</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>Spiced post workout shake </title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/recipe-finder/2356-spiced-post-workout-shake</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"intro\">Get your protein fix post workout with these delicious spiced shake by personal trainer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/teganhaining/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Tegan Haining.</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Ingredients</strong></span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s3\">\u00bd cup roasted sweet potato&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s3\">\u00bc tsp cinnamon</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s3\">\u00bc tsp cardamom</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s3\">\u00bc tsp ginger</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s3\">\u00bd cup ice</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s3\">1 cup almond or coconut milk</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s3\">1 tbsp maple syrup</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s3\">1 tsp vanilla extract&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong></strong></span><span class=\"s3\">1 scoop BSC Naturals Vegan Protein</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"s3\">Method</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\">Blend well to combine, drink immediately.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>NUTRITION (per serve)</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Protein: 48.2g // Fat: 10.7g //</span><span class=\"s1\">Carbs: 39.9g // Calories: 448.05</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/recipe-finder/2356-spiced-post-workout-shake\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2017 00:19:49 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/recipe-finder/2356-spiced-post-workout-shake</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n",
