Fred Francis, that the data underpinning the park proposal was no longer relevant.</p>\n<p>For starters, said Krutsch, the concrete drain between the Herb Gray Parkway and Dougall Avenue was nowhere close to full. His personal observations that day, backed by technical data, indicate the drain was carrying between 60 and 65 per cent of capacity at its peak.</p>\n<p>Krutsch said the widespread basement flooding north and south of the drain was a result of local sewer and drainage systems becoming overwhelmed by the downpour and had nothing to do with the way the drain performed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWater levels in the drain did not rise significantly above the middle panel of the concrete lining, which is consistent with what the city was presented in the past. The past representations are still accurate, and are still relevant,\u201d said Krutsch. \u201cThat central section (Dougall to the Parkway) has a ridiculously high design capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p>He conceded many Windsor residents, unfamiliar with the drain\u2019s design, concluded that day that it was full. \u201cI respect that to a layman it looks full. You see water over the majority of the corridor and it looks full. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s never been close to full.\u201d Krutsch said there\u2019s a depth-perception issue, especially peering down from the Dougall Avenue bridge, that creates what amounts to an illusion.</p>\n<p>Krutsch said the widespread belief that the drain, built to handle a storm the size of Hurricane Hazel, which devastated the Toronto area in 1954, contributed to South Windsor basement flooding last year is simply not factual. \u201cThat drain did not have a measurable affect on how local sewers functioned.\u201d</p>\n<p>The linear park plan, said Krutsch, could create a six-metre-wide naturalized space, protected by retaining walls, for bike and walking trails on either side of the drain while having zero impact on its hydraulic function. \u201cIt would have had no effect on the flow in the channel. No effect whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Krutsch said he\u2019s \u201cnot married to this project by any means. I did a study because the city asked me to,\u201d and if the city has other priorities, including road and sewer work, so be it. What he resents, he said, is seeing it portrayed, through misinformation, as not feasible.</p>\n<p>City engineer Mark Winterton said Krutsch is the recognized Grand Marais Drain authority and he supports his conclusions regarding its performance during the storm and agrees the linear park remains \u201cdo-able.\u201d</p>\n<p>The issue is priorities, said Winterton. He said the sewer master plan, with an update report coming to council in late March, could produce relatively easy \u201cearly wins\u201d to help alleviate flooding this year but major recommendations in 2019 could involve big capital expenses like upgraded pumping stations or additional retention ponds.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think (the linear park) is a dead project. It\u2019s just not a higher priority given the priorities through the sewer master plan,\u201d said Winterton. In other words, it\u2019s gone to the back of what could be a very long queue.</p>\n<p>Mind you, if the project has lost the support of its most ardent political backer in Francis, who remains deeply skeptical of its post-storm viability, insisting he would need fresh technical proof, then it\u2019s as good as dead.</p>\n<p>I get it. This is an election year and no politician with hundreds of unhappy flood-jittery homeowners in his ward wants to be seen chasing a dream, no matter how worthy, when people are screaming for practical fixes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:g_henderson61@yahoo.ca\">g_henderson61@yahoo.ca</a></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://windsorstar.com/opinion/columnists/henderson-turning-the-drain-into-a-park-is-still-viable-says-expert/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<postmedia:alexa><![CDATA[Henderson: Turning the drain into a park is still viable, says expert.

Christine Bissonnette filed a human rights complaint after she failed twice to be promoted to inspector in 2015 and 2016. At her hearing Friday, Bissonnette argued she was just as qualified as the men who got promotions. But, she said, there is \u201csystemic discrimination\u201d at the force that keeps her down.</p>\n<p>Bissonnette was hired as a cadet in 1987. She was promoted, she said, but it became obvious she would advance no further.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to understand the culture of this organization,\u201d she told the hearing adjudicator after the police service\u2019s lawyer repeatedly objected to Bissonnette\u2019s examples.</p>\n<p>Bissonnette said male officers were handpicked by the brass to receive specialized training that made them eligible to sit on panels that rate candidates for promotion. The training, Bissonnette said, gave these officers insider knowledge that helped them succeed when they competed for their own promotions.</p>\n<p>Bissonnette said that after she became Windsor\u2019s first polygraph examiner in 1995, she was transferred to the criminal investigations division. She said it was clear the senior constables there did not want a female officer in their midst. She was then transferred to the special investigations unit which handles sexual assault cases, she said.</p>\n<p>The police service\u2019s lawyer, Suzanne Porter, objected to Bissonnette bringing up issues that predate her complaint to the hearing.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s what happened,\u201d Bissonnette responded. \u201cIt&#8217;s what I\u2019ve been subjected to in my employment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bissonnette said she was eventually transferred to the chief\u2019s office where she became an executive officer. During her time there, she revamped court security, finding cost savings for the city. She also drafted police policy about cell phone use.</p>\n<p>She was made a staff sergeant after being previously passed over for the position. She said she was promoted because the chief had permission from the police services board to go \u201cover-strength\u201d on the rank, allowing him to appoint one more staff sergeant than the usual complement.</p>\n<p>Bissonnette said she and other women on the force have been harassed, singled out and ostracized. Other women were promoted because they didn\u2019t complain like she did, she claims. She said one of her superiors once told her, &#8220;Be careful on the battles you pick.&#8221; Another said, &#8220;Movement is more based on popularity than performance.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mayor Drew Dilkens attended the hearing Thursday and popped in briefly Friday. Chief Al Frederick has been in attendance too. Friday, he read from a prepared statement after the hearing adjourned for the day.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Windsor Police Service takes these allegations very seriously and respects the rights of the complainant and the due process provided by the hearing,\u201d Frederick said. But, he added, \u201cThe Windsor Police Service denies these allegations and intends to vigorously defend the integrity and impartiality of the promotional process and those responsible for administering the process.\u201d</p>\n<p>He said the force \u201cstands by all members who have competed and achieved promotion in these processes.\u201d</p>\n<p>The service has yet to submit any evidence at the hearing.</p>\n<p>Bissonnette, who is currently on leave, told the hearing she recorded a conversation she had with Deputy Chief Rick Derus after she was passed over for promotion. Adjudicator Bruce Best said he wants to consider written argument from both sides before deciding whether Bissonnette can use it as evidence when the hearing resumes on dates yet to be selected in April or May.</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:ssacheli@postmedia.com\">ssacheli@postmedia.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://Twitter.com/WinStarSacheli\">Twitter.com/WinStarSacheli</a></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_955861\" style=\"max-width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://wpmedia.windsorstar.com/2018/02/16-bissonnette-jpg.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"955861\" data-permalink=\"http://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/being-female-kept-her-from-getting-promoted-windsor-police-officer-says/attachment/16-bissonnette-jpg-jpg/#main\" data-orig-file=\"http://wpmedia.windsorstar.com/2018/02/16-bissonnette-jpg.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1000,750\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Nick Brancaccio&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS-1D Mark IV&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Windsor, Ontario.

The building has reached its capacity.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve pushed this facility as far as we can take it given the volumes we&#8217;re doing and the patient services we&#8217;re offering,&#8221; said Shah, whose firm offers X-ray, mammography, ultrasound and bone mineral density testing at nine locations in Windsor, Essex County and Chatham-Kent.</p>\n<p>The Ouellette building serves as the headquarters for these independent health facilities. He said consideration was given to renovating. &#8220;But our perspective was we want to continue to offer the best services in Windsor and to do that we should build new.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The proposal is going through the approval process at city hall. It calls for demolishing a house \u2013 owned by WRA, also known as Windsor Radiological Associates, for a number of years \u2013 directly to the north and constructing a 9,000-square-foot building. Once it&#8217;s built and running, the existing 3,000-square-foot building will be torn down to provide parking.</p>\n<p>About 4,500 square feet of the new building will be for clinical space, while the rest will be administrative. Shah said he anticipates that increasing the space should help reduce wait times at the clinic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re excited about building this new facility.&#8221; He couldn&#8217;t provide an estimate of how much the project will cost. He said construction should start within a year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:bcross@postmedia.com\">bcross@postmedia.com</a></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_955848\" style=\"max-width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://wpmedia.windsorstar.com/2018/02/14-exterior-jpg.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"955848\" data-permalink=\"http://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/wra-clinics-wants-to-rebuild-downtown-hq-triple-its-size/attachment/14-exterior-jpg-jpg/#main\" data-orig-file=\"http://wpmedia.windsorstar.com/2018/02/14-exterior-jpg-e1518827908846.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"995,367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;13&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Nick Brancaccio&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS-1D X&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Windsor, Ontario.
