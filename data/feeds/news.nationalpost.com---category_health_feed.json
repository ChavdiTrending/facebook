The program was supposed to help reduce disease.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But Strathdee&#8217;s study found that HIV had instead become more prevalent in Vancouver since the introduction of the program. Her research team concluded their &#8220;results don&#8217;t argue against the overall effectiveness of needle exchange programs,&#8221; rather such programs can&#8217;t operate in a vacuum. Other resources, like accessible housing and addiction treatment, must also be accessible to keep HIV prevalence low.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But a lot of the media (specifically in the United States, according to Strathdee) got it all wrong. Stories about the uselessness of needle exchange programs flooded the papers. In 1999, the U.S. Congress even cited her study as a reason to keep a ban on needle exchanges in place.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cI was crushed,&#8221; Strathdee said. &#8220;For years afterwards I was presenting the data over and over again, trying to set the record straight. I met with cops and the press and policy officials just trying to undue the damage.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Many scientists say they&#8217;ve had a similar experience, where inaccurate reporting has lead to serious consequences. But who&#8217;s to blame \u2014 the scientist or the journalist?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The answer, according to Strathdee and cognitive neuroscientist Dr. Christopher Chambers, is both.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think scientists really understand or maybe even fully respect the professional and ethical requirements of &nbsp;journalism and I think we need to learn more about that&#8221; Chambers said. &#8220;And most journalists who report on science don&#8217;t read the paper or they read it only in a superficial way.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Last week, Chambers started a Twitter thread that garnered more than 2,000 likes and retweets after a fellow scientist asked his followers: &#8220;Should journalists let scientists review text and quotes for accuracy before publication?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The first tweet in Chambers&#8217; response read: &#8220;Lots of heated discussion going on about this. It\u2019s not the first time \u2014&nbsp;this issue comes up repeatedly. I used to be firmly of the &#8216;I\u2019m a scientist.

With journalists working under tight deadlines and often lacking the science background to fact-check the research, this leads to inaccurate stories.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Scientists often glance (at a press release) and assume, &#8216;Oh well I guess my press office has to rev it up a bit, make it a bit sexy,&#8217; and they feel they can distance themselves from accountability,&#8221; Chambers said. &#8220;But scientists should be expecting misinterpretations and should also be saying what the study doesn&#8217;t show.&#8221; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>With respect to what a study doesn&#8217;t show, Chambers said a common example relates to animal research. Taking a study about pregnant mice and suggesting how this can relate to pregnant women is well beyond what the research has actually proven. Another classic example is the promise of a new drug despite clinical trials not even being underway.&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"embed-twitter\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Fourth \u2013 if you really want accurate science news, avoid exaggeration in your own press releases and anticipate likely misunderstandings by including a section \u201cWhat this study does NOT show\u201d.

But in an effort to attract readers, news stories sometimes make bold statements when the findings aren&#8217;t actually groundbreaking. He thinks the media can find ways to get the public excited about the scientific process without the added hype.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a danger in cumulative exaggeration and the sending of misleading messages,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just about exaggerating the findings of a particular study, it&#8217;s about distorting the way science really works.

And that IQ tests aren\u2019t a reliable measure of intelligence, as results are heavily influenced by the test taker\u2019s culture.</p>\n<p>Changing a belief can be disorienting for an individual. But it appears even more so for a profession.</p>\n<p>Decades ago, ulcers were treated with bed rest and bland diets. In 1982, Australian physicians Robin Warren and Barry Marshall found ulcers were caused by the Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacterium, not stress or diet.</p>\n<p>The medical profession was slow to catch on. Fifteen years after the discovery of H. pylori, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention launched a sweeping campaign to educate professionals and consumers alike, prompted by a U.S. study that revealed nearly 90 per cent of sufferers blamed ulcers on stress or worry, and 60 per cent believed diet was also a factor.</p>\n<p>Authorities, it seems, fail to act on proven information, and not just when it comes to our health.</p>\n<p>Take probate fees, for instance. Most provinces levy probate fees that far exceed the cost of probating an estate \u2014 despite repeated examples of probate fees leading to elder abuse.</p>\n<p>A probate fee is paid by an individual\u2019s estate to validate the will and the named executor, giving the executor the clear authority to act. Each province sets its own fees, and they vary considerably.</p>\n<p>In Alberta, an estate with $1 million of assets pays a probate fee of $525, in Quebec the fee is less than $100. In B.C., Saskatchewan and Ontario, the probate fee (called an estate administration tax in Ontario) for a million-dollar estate ranges from $10,000 to almost $15,000. If Alberta and Quebec can probate any will for $525 or less, then B.C., Saskatchewan and Ontario are using probate fees as a tax \u2014 a tax that is unwarranted and, in some cases, leads to extreme hardship.</p>\n<p>In the grand scheme of things, an amount such as $15,000 on a $1-million estate is pretty small potatoes. What\u2019s more, a lawyer can structure an estate to avoid or minimize probate fees, so these fees are primarily paid by those who are not properly advised.</p>\n<p>By seeking to avoid probate fees, some individuals lose everything.</p>\n<p>Typically, they\u2019ve been encouraged to turn their private bank or investment accounts into joint accounts (usually with an adult child), exposing themselves to needless risk.</p>\n<p>A joint account, whether used for banking or investment, is held in two or more names, and every person named has complete access to the assets in that account.</p>\n<p>Creating joint accounts has led to unintended financial losses for the original owner of the assets.</p>\n<p>Sometimes financial losses arise due to a misunderstanding. Even though they were added to facilitate a transfer of funds when their parent dies, adult children may believe the funds are theirs to spend. And they do.</p>\n<p>Other times, losses are caused by divorce or business failure. If an adult child named to a joint account suffers a marriage breakdown or business loss, the assets of the parent may be included in the divorce settlement or as part of the security for the bank loan.</p>\n<p>And in some cases, the adult child deliberately abuses the parent\u2019s trust and clears out the joint account, leaving their parent in dire financial straits.</p>\n<p>There is a clear lesson here: don\u2019t create a joint account simply to avoid probate fees. Even at their highest, these fees are a small percentage of an estate. It\u2019s not worth jeopardizing your security to save a few dollars. If your estate is large enough that probate fees are a concern, see a lawyer who can help you safely minimize them.</p>\n<p>Awareness and education about the risks of joint accounts are important, but they are not enough.</p>\n<p>To protect seniors, we must heed the lessons of history. Probate fees may lead to joint accounts, and joint accounts may lead to elder abuse.</p>\n<p>The solution? Limit probate fees to the small fixed amounts actually necessary to probate an estate. It\u2019s well past time for all our provincial and territorial governments to follow the lead set by Alberta. It\u2019s time for high probate fees and the related elder abuse to disappear.</p>\n<p><em>Join our National Day of Action to Protect Pensions.

She noted that only about 20 per cent of people with obesity who lose weight are able to maintain their lower weight. \u201cWe have to stop treating it as a short-term illness by giving patients some support and help, and then just letting them fend for themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>The study looked at 35 adult women and men who were classified as having severe obesity. Over a two-year period, they had five three-week stays at a weight-loss centre, where treatment included increased physical exercise, a moderately restricted diet and psychological therapy.</p>\n<p>Back at home, they were advised to continue exercise and maintain a healthy diet similar to that provided at the centre, with an emphasis on fruits and vegetables.</p>\n<p>After two years, everyone had lost weight \u2013 on average eight per cent of their original weight. But everyone was also hungrier.</p>\n<ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/the-shape-of-the-future-is-obesity-a-crisis-or-just-the-latest-stage-of-evolution\">The shape of the future: Is obesity a crisis or just the latest stage of evolution?</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nationalpost.com/health/did-your-january-diet-not-work-u-k-scientists-may-have-discovered-why\">Did your January diet not work?

At the time, Charles Burant, director of the University of Michigan Nutrition Obesity Research Center, described the hormone changes as a survival tactic.</p>\n<p>\u201cMultiple mechanisms have been developed, over eons of evolution, to get you to regain weight once you lose it&#8230;to tell your brain you&#8217;re hungry and to ensure that you don&#8217;t stop eating,\u201d Burant told Health.com. \u201cIf you don&#8217;t have those drives, you wouldn&#8217;t be alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>The new study found that levels of ghrelin significantly increased in study participants, along with their reported feelings of hunger. A second group of hormones, which produce a feeling of fullness after eating, also increased, but their effect was overridden by the ghrelin, the researchers found.</p>\n<p>The increase in the hunger hormone levels was prolonged, remaining high throughout the study.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis means that patients with severe obesity who have lost significant amounts of weight with lifestyle interventions, combining diet and exercise, will have to deal with increased hunger in the long-term,\u201d the authors write. \u201cThis information is of importance for patients and health professionals working with this patient group, and strategies should be identified that can help patients to deal with increased hunger in the long-term.\u201d</p>\n<p>Martins said obesity should be treated as a chronic disease, with patients receiving close follow-up over time to help them keep their weight down.</p>\n<p><em>\u2022 Email: <a href=\"mailto:ghamilton@nationalpost.com\">ghamilton@nationalpost.com</a> | Twitter: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/grayhamilton\" class=\"twitter-follow-button\">grayhamilton</a></em></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://nationalpost.com/health/study-sheds-light-on-why-hunger-increases-after-weight-loss/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t<postmedia:alexa><![CDATA[Study sheds light on why hunger increases after weight loss.

Furthermore, the mouse that received the second-hand stress was in turn able to transmit it to a third mouse.</p>\n<p>The findings point to a useful mechanism that helps groups survive. \u201cIf individuals live in a group &#8212; you can talk about mice or humans &#8212; it is a benefit that if one is exposed to a threat, that information can be relayed to the others,\u201d Bains said. \u201cThat information isn\u2019t just a one-shot thing. They actually remember this, to say, \u2018OK, I\u2019m not going to go down that street because something bad happened.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>The message from the study is not to avoid distraught people, Bains said. In fact, female mice showed reduced stress loads when they interacted with a partner. (The same was not true of male mice.)</p>\n<ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://nationalpost.com/news/world/are-you-feeling-stressed-take-a-whiff-of-your-partners-t-shirt\">Are you feeling stressed?

The bones were set and fixed with little titanium plates and screws, and then the surgeons reconnected the arteries to get blood circulating to the tissue.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And once you do that, and you take the clamps off the vessels, you see those lips that were blue turn pink.

Again, half (51 per cent) said yes. Then they were shown a three-minute video about face transplants, featuring before and after photos of Norris and Harrison.

It\u2019s who we are; it\u2019s how we identify each other. It\u2019s crucial to our personal identity. It\u2019s a subject of romance and poetry and all kinds of literature. It&#8217;s you.\u201d Internal organs simply don&#8217;t have the same emotional pull.</p>\n<p>And while no religion is formally against face transplants \u2014 most religious groups view organ and tissue donation as an act of charity and love \u2014 some people believe resurrection requires the face be preserved.</p>\n<p>Caplan said saving lives should override other religious concerns. People have trouble sleeping, making tears, chewing, speaking and breathing properly before their transplants.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe kept saying to the people we interviewed in the park that this wasn\u2019t just like some kind of cosmetic surgery, which made them seem to appreciate why donating faces was important,\u201d Caplan said.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut still, it weighs on people\u2019s minds. &#8216;How is this going to affect my funeral?

When the next renter put the tape in a VCR, they\u2019d face the nuisance of rewinding it.</p>\n<p>My classmates and I struggled with the business case. We suggested posting notices (Please be kind. Rewind.) and threatening fines or even loss of membership for those who wouldn\u2019t comply.</p>\n<p>Some even thought of altering the video case so that it couldn\u2019t hold a tape that wasn\u2019t rewound. Nothing seemed feasible.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the store found a solution. They started asking customers to rewind tapes before playing them. Problem solved.</p>\n<p>In long-term care, we typically look to obvious, and often expensive, solutions: more staff, more facilities, more beds.</p>\n<p>These solutions do play a critical part in ensuring appropriate care is provided and waiting lists are manageable. But are we overlooking simple, creative solutions?</p>\n<p>Yes we are.</p>\n<p>One of the best ways to ensure people avoid harm in long-term care is to keep them from going there in the first place.</p>\n<p>Many provinces do this in part by having lengthy waiting lists: no beds, no long-term care. That is not the solution.</p>\n<p>Those waiting for long-term care typically have high needs, and informal, unpaid caregivers are often cracking under the strain.</p>\n<p>But there is another way to reduce the need for long-term care. Funding high-dose flu shots for all Canadians 65 and over would keep thousands out of hospitals and long-term care homes every year.</p>\n<p>Many people\u2019s physical health will gradually deteriorate to the point they can no longer remain at home, even with support. Long-term care is the only place that can meet their needs.</p>\n<p>But that\u2019s not always the case. About one in six people live independently (without any homecare) when a single negative event ends up forcing them into long-term care. Falls and flus are among the most common such events.</p>\n<p>A broken hip or the influenza virus will land an individual in hospital. While people may recover to some extent, all too often they don\u2019t regain the stamina and strength necessary to manage on their own.</p>\n<p>This is particularly tragic when it comes to the flu, as so many instances of influenza can be prevented.</p>\n<p>Over 8,000 seniors end up in hospital every year due to influenza. Many of them were living independently before becoming ill, but leave the hospital not to go home but to enter long-term care.</p>\n<p>While flu shots aren\u2019t 100 per cent effective, 47 per cent of individuals vaccinated with a high-dose flu shot are protected from influenza.</p>\n<p>Many medications are less effective in older patients. Compared to the standard flu shot, the high dose flu vaccine is 24 per cent more effective in those 65 and over, and 32 per cent more effective in those 75 and up.</p>\n<p>We need to invest in appropriate support for older Canadians, including in long-term care. At the same time, why not invest some funds to provide critical vaccines that keep seniors healthy and active, rather than waiting until they need long-term care, with its attendant risks?</p>\n<p>CARP is calling on all provinces to fund high-dose flu vaccines for residents 65 and over. We won\u2019t solve our long-term care problems overnight. But we can solve them for many people \u2014 by ensuring they never need it.</p>\n<p>Join our National Day of Action to Protect Pensions.

But that&#8217;s easier said than done.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Taking a drug and turning it into something that people can actually use is a gruelling process, one that can take decades. Dr. Gerry Wright is a professor of biochemistry at McMaster University who has been working in drug development for more than 25 years. Throughout his entire career, his team has discovered a single molecule with pharmaceutical potential.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cDrug discovery is hard, hard work and certainly not for the faint of heart,&#8221; Wright says. &#8220;Plus, it takes a really long time.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the 1940s there was an antibiotic boom&nbsp;\u2014 discoveries were plentiful and infections that once meant an automatic death sentence were suddenly easy to treat. Nearly 25,000 chemicals were discovered around this time, but Wright estimates that less than 200 of them have made it to clinical use since the golden age of drug discovery. Since creating new drugs has proved incredibly difficult, Wright says there&#8217;s certainly promise in the Australian team&#8217;s tactic of going back to the antibiotic archives.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But Wright cautioned that the exciting discovery is still in very early stages. Approving any type of antibiotic for clinical use requires a lot work, first proving its effectiveness in a laboratory setting, before moving onto clinical trials.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly a positive advance forward, but the reality is that tomorrow they could test it in an animal and the animal still dies so the drug is rendered useless,&#8221; he says.</p>\n<p>Wright says pharmaceutical companies haven&#8217;t shown much interest in developing new antibiotics, partially because it&#8217;s incredibly difficult and time consuming. Another reason is that companies don&#8217;t make a lot of money off antibiotics since they&#8217;re only taken for a few days or weeks until an infection is cleared.</p>\n<p>But perhaps the biggest problem with new antibiotics is that they too could eventually stop working. And that&#8217;s why researchers have also been working on alternatives, such as phage therapy (a type of virus that attacks bacteria and kills it) and new vaccines.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul class=\"related_links\"><li><a href=\"http://nationalpost.com/news/0114-na-superbug\">Superbug immune to virtually every known antibiotic kills U.S. woman</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nationalpost.com/health/these-12-superbugs-including-nightmare-bacteria-pose-greatest-threat-to-human-health-who\">These 12 superbugs \u2014 including &#039;nightmare bacteria&#039; \u2014 pose greatest threat to human health: WHO</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nationalpost.com/health/its-not-always-a-good-idea-to-finish-your-prescription-researchers-say\">It&#039;s not always a good idea to finish your prescription, researchers say</a></li></ul>\n<p>\u201cI think anyone who says they have a crystal ball and thinks we should do things just one way (in the fight against resistance) is insane,&#8221; Wright says. \u201cThere&#8217;s no panacea out there and all the problems we have with antibiotics exist with other methods as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Even vaccines are difficult to create because viruses continually change their structure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Although Wright admits we\u2019re in a \u201cpretty dark situation\u201d when it comes to protecting ourselves against bacteria, he says it\u2019s not all doom and gloom. He&#8217;s confident that Canada could be a world leader in research that will be used to develop new drugs and antibiotic alternatives.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoing forward, we have to be careful using antibiotics and we have to be innovative,&#8221; he said. \u201cBut we also need drugs \u2014 they\u2019ve become the foundation of medicine.\u201d</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://nationalpost.com/news/world/how-a-forgotten-40-year-old-antibiotic-could-be-crucial-in-the-fight-against-superbugs/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<postmedia:alexa><![CDATA[How a forgotten 40-year-old antibiotic could be crucial in the fight against superbugs.
