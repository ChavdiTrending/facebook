While the couple said their decision to split &quot;was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year&quot; in a joint statement, it seems like long distance could have also played a factor. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;strong&gt;ET&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.etonline.com/why-jennifer-aniston-and-justin-theroux-split-shes-la-hes-ny-exclusive-96554&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the pair had a hard time agreeing on where to live&lt;/a&gt;. While Jennifer prefers the West Coast, Justin&#039;s roots have always been in NYC. &quot;He much prefers being [in New York] and that&#039;s been a major issue for them for a long time,&quot; a source told the publication. &quot;Justin has a very diverse friend group, and he likes that they&#039;re not all in the industry. He&#039;s friends with people in the restaurant world, writers, comedians, artists, tattoo artists. It&#039;s an eclectic group and he doesn&#039;t have that type of network in LA.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;related-stories&quot;&gt;Related&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Jennifer-Aniston-Justin-Theroux-Sweetest-Pictures-38047091&quot;&gt;The Way They Were: A Look Back at Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux&#039;s Sweetest Moments&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While Justin tried to help Jen adjust to the NYC lifestyle by moving out of his Greenwich Village apartment and living in the West Village together, the source adds that the limited amount of privacy in the city eventually became too much for the former &lt;strong&gt;Friends &lt;/strong&gt;actress. &quot;Justin can hop on his [motorcycle], walk in the neighbourhood, hang at a bar and all that without being bothered, but for Jen, the paparazzi are all over her,&quot; the source added. &quot;She just never really could get settled in, she wasn&#039;t happy [in New York].&quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Even though the two eventually agreed to move to LA, Justin would constantly travel back and forth. &quot;He was bicoastal, she was not,&quot; the source said. Despite their disagreement on where to live, the source added that there was no one incident that made them split, they simply drifted apart. &quot;They really were a great couple,&quot; the source said. &quot;And they cared a lot about each other. Justin was always really protective of her. They both wanted this to work.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Celebrity Couples\">Celebrity Couples</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Justin Theroux\">Justin Theroux</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Jennifer Aniston\">Jennifer Aniston</category>\n <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 16:14:03 +0000</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Kelsie Gibson</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">44591295</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>Why Did Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux Breakup?</search_title>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title>Meet Chris Fischer, the Lucky Guy Who Stole Amy Schumer&#039;s Heart in Less Than 3 Months</title>\n <link>https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Who-Chris-Fischer-44588195</link>\n <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Who-Chris-Fischer-44588195&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;160&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; src=&quot;https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/v8PvE9bSG9zLaB3dZEwZFmsDS_w/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/02/15/765/n/1922398/b1597d275a85c1a5d8ccf7.36637896_edit_img_image_44587829_1518711887.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned=&quot;&quot; data-instgrm-permalink=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BfOYmYPFShB/&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;8&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot; class=&quot;insta-preview-v1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=&#039;  line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%; background:url(&quot;https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/c3a90d13362618b71142e87667ec10c8/5B25D0A1/t51.2885-15/e35/27878916_379964702415386_5123481094582173696_n.jpg&quot;); background-size:contain;&#039;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BfOYmYPFShB/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A post shared by @&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/amyschumer/&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; amyschumer&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2018-02-15T16:53:47+00:00&quot;&gt;Feb 15, 2018 at 8:53am PST&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Amy-Schumer-Married-Chris-Fischer-44587444&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amy Schumer is officially a married woman&lt;/a&gt;.

After a fan asked Kristen to write a note for his friends for their wedding, she decided to take it up a notch by giving her best marriage tips. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wrote something congratulatory but then thought &#039;Kristen! Wait! You are an old married woman, shouldn&#039;t you have some wisdom to share?!&#039;&quot; she wrote alongside the handwritten note. &quot;After I was finished I realized what I wrote is pretty much the A-Z of how @daxshepard and I keep our relationship healthy.

Even longtime married couples gave their seal of approval on social media. It&#039;s obvious that Dax and Kristen&#039;s marriage tips are working.

Amy stunned in a strappy white dress, while Chris looked dapper in a black suit. The secret ceremony brought out Amy&#039;s family and closest friends, including Jennifer Lawrence, Jake Gyllenhaal, Jennifer Aniston, Chelsea Handler, Larry David, David Spade, and Judd Apatow. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/amy-schumer-marries-chef-chris-fischer-in-surprise-wedding/?utm_source=popsugar.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=pubexchange_article&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A comedian reportedly officiated their nuptials&lt;/a&gt;, while the couple read their own vows. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the news broke on Thursday, Amy shared an Instagram album from her wedding, as well as a few snaps on her Instagram story. &quot;Yup,&quot; she simply captioned the album. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BfObw-flAqN/?taken-by=amyschumer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;She also shared a note with her fans&lt;/a&gt;, which reads as follows: &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 things:&lt;br /&gt;\nNo I&#039;m not pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And no gifts but thank you for asking. Instead please consider [a] donation to Everytown for gun safety.

Seriously, have people ever been more concerned about a stranger&#039;s love life? Their five-year marriage may go down in history books, but it wasn&#039;t the first high-profile relationship for either of the stars. Jen went on to date other hot celebrity guys (including a couple of costars) before eventually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Jennifer-Aniston-Justin-Theroux-Sweetest-Pictures-20737817&quot; &gt;marrying Justin Theroux&lt;/a&gt; in 2015. Sadly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Jennifer-Aniston-Justin-Theroux-Separating-44590153&quot; &gt;the couple announced their separation&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, saying it &quot;was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While Jen has made headlines for her past relationships, she has also served as an inspiration for women and will forever be one of the shining examples of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Celebrity-Women-Who-Bounced-Back-After-Bad-Breakups-38191151&quot; &gt;resiliency after a bad breakup&lt;/a&gt;.

He married fellow actor Charlotte Riley in 2014, and the couple welcomed their first child the following year.

Other famous alumni include Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, David Oyelowo, and Ruth Wilson.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;She and Tom met when they starred together in a British TV adaptation of &lt;strong&gt;Wuthering Heights&lt;/strong&gt; in 2009.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;She also starred alongside Tom in &lt;strong&gt;The Take&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Peaky Blinders&lt;/strong&gt; (though they&#039;ve never shared a scene in the latter).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;She also writes! Charlotte won a Sunday Times Playwriting Award for &lt;strong&gt;Shaking Cecilia&lt;/strong&gt;, a comedy she cowrote with Tiffany Wood in 2004.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;She used to sing in a 1940s doo-wop band called The Flirtinis.\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;She went to clown school. No joke, she trained at the prestigious Ecole Philippe Gaulier. She described one of her clowns as &quot;quite possibly the most angry Minnie Mouse of all time.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;She played Kate Middleton in the controversial TV drama &lt;strong&gt;King Charles III&lt;/strong&gt;.

They represent the UK overseas and recognise the achievements and struggles of those in their own country. They support charities, and they maintain royal traditions. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There needs to be continuity in order for the family to survive, and so one of the most important roles of a monarch or future monarch is to produce &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/What-Heir-Spare-43703427&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an heir and a &quot;spare.&quot;&lt;/a&gt; That younger sibling is next in line to the throne after their elder brother or sister, and so until the elder starts having children, they are treated as such, but what comes after that? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;related-stories&quot;&gt;Related&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/What-Prince-Charles-Do-When-He-Becomes-King-44136183&quot;&gt;How Prince Charles Plans to Change the Royal Family When He Becomes King&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/love/Princess-Margaret-20313379&quot;&gt;Princess Margaret&lt;/a&gt;&#039;s royal role was (apart from being fabulous, naturally)? How about Prince Andrew&#039;s? In their youth, the two royals were among the most glamorous and famous people in the world. Yet as they moved into senior positions within the royal family, they both seemed to lose their public attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Prince-Harry-Biggest-Milestones-44024247?utm_medium=redirect&amp;amp;utm_campaign=US:GB&amp;amp;utm_source=direct&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Prince Harry is the latest member of the family&lt;/a&gt; to be in the age-old position of being bumped further and further down the line of succession with the birth of every new niece and nephew, but the big difference between Harry and his great-aunt Margaret and uncle Andrew seems to be that Harry has been preparing for this time for many years, and he sees his future clearly. Thanks to guidance and support from his family and a few trusted mentors, Harry has spent the past 10 years mapping out the role he will develop further for the rest of his life, and he will continue to split his charity work into three main areas: veterans, those affected by HIV/AIDS, and conservation. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;1. Veteran Support&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;His affinity with the military started very young, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Prince-Harry-Uniform-Pictures-44160319&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Harry spent 10 years in the armed forces&lt;/a&gt;, twice serving on the front line in Afghanistan. It is a career that nurtured and shaped him into the man he is today and led him to set up the Invictus Games, which is in its fourth year and will be held in Sydney in October. The prince is also involved with numerous other military-related charities and has received a humanitarian award from former Secretary of State Colin Powell for his work in this field.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;2. HIV/AIDS Awareness&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Harry first visited the African country of Lesotho in 2004, and two years later he set up the charity Sentebale to help the young people there who were affected by HIV/AIDS. He also took a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Prince-Harry-Gets-HIV-Test-41973261&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ground-breaking live HIV test&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 to break down the stigma of getting tested, after which the demand for tests increased five-fold.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;3. Nature Conservation&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After first visiting Africa in 1997 when he was 13 years old, Harry fell in love with the continent. He returned to South Africa many times when he was dating Zimbabwean student Chelsy Davy; he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/Prince-Harry-Holidays-44059852&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vacationed in Botswana, Mozambique, and Namibia&lt;/a&gt;; and over the years he has undertaken conservation work in Kenya, Botswana, Namibia, Tanzania, and South Africa. Harry is also patron of African Parks and Rhino Conservation Botswana.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Prince-Harry-Meghan-Markle-Life-Milestones-Pictures-44314647&quot;&gt;With the woman he loves by his side&lt;/a&gt;, it seems that Harry is finally comfortable in his royal role. Over the next few decades, he and Meghan Markle will be important members of the family. However, even when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Why-Prince-William-Kate-Middleton-Having-Third-Kid-44024291&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;George, Charlotte, and the new Cambridge baby&lt;/a&gt; come of age and start undertaking their own engagements, Harry will continue with his work because he has found where his passions lie.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Meghan Markle\">Meghan Markle</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/The British Royals\">The British Royals</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Royal Family\">Royal Family</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Prince Harry\">Prince Harry</category>\n <pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 19:50:15 +0000</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Marcia Moody</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">44540621</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>What Does Prince Harry Do?</search_title>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title>Celebrities Are Hooked on Snapping Selfies in This Otherworldly Bathroom</title>\n <link>https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Celebrities-Sketch-London-Restaurant-Bathroom-43844467</link>\n <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Celebrities-Sketch-London-Restaurant-Bathroom-43844467&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;120&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; src=&quot;https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/LoqnMFLaXezvN5UsYbhbqipP0PM/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/02/13/647/n/2589278/6f7f422825de91bb_just-endless-amount-tea-have-you-visiting.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&#039;ve ever come across a certain pod-filled, rainbow-roofed lavatory on your feed and thought it could only possibly exist on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Wrinkle-Time-Trailer-43747007&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;set of &lt;strong&gt;A Wrinkle of Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you are mistaken. The bathroom in question actually belongs to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/smart-living/Afternoon-Tea-Sketch-London-43415165&quot; &gt;London restaurant Sketch&lt;/a&gt;, a favourite hotspot for celebrities, bloggers, and selfie-aficionados alike. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whether you&#039;re sipping on an Old Fashioned in their pocket-sized East Bar or seated in the equally-iconic Gallery decorated by a commissioned artist every few years (at this moment, it&#039;s perfectly pink thanks to David Shrigley) - the bathrooms are a must-visit. Not only will you be transported to an otherworldly affair, you may even find yourself in the company of nests of geese in a Winter wonderland or floral paradise.

She has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Queen-Elizabeth-Trip-Ghana-Crown-44439666&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spearheaded a history-making trip to Ghana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Prince-Charles-Princess-Diana-Divorce-Details-43439608&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ordered divorces&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Only-Does-Queen-Watch-Downton-Abbey-She-Points-Out-Factual-Errors-38307297&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;critiqued episodes of &lt;strong&gt;Downton Abbey&lt;/strong&gt; for historical accuracy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Because of her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/One-Amused-Guide-Queen-Many-Faces-37315262&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;serious veneer and commanding presence&lt;/a&gt;, we don&#039;t often think about the fact that the Queen is actually &lt;em&gt;really funny&lt;/em&gt;. One recent example? During an interview reflecting on her coronation, Elizabeth &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Queen-Elizabeth-II-Plays-Her-Crown-44501815&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;manhandled the hell out of the Imperial State Crown&lt;/a&gt;, poking and prodding it while saying, &quot;It&#039;s very solid, isn&#039;t it?&quot; The humorous moment put the queen in a relatable light (as does her horse riding, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Queen-Elizabeth-II-Driving-Photos-May-2017-43535926&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;car driving&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Does-Queen-Elizabeth-Drink-Alcohol-43253611&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;binge-drinking&lt;/a&gt;), but there are even more quotes from the Queen that show off her biting sense of humour. In her book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Wicked-Wit-Queen-Elizabeth-II/dp/1782433651&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Wicked Wit of Queen Elizabeth II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Karen Dolby compiled the monarch&#039;s best one-liners - and we&#039;ve highlighted 16 of them here.

The title, announced as part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-years-honours-list-2018&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Queen&#039;s New Year&#039;s Honours list&lt;/a&gt;, rewards the achievements and service of extraordinary people across the UK, its overseas territories, and, in some cases, the Commonwealth. British dames are essentially a select group of women who have achieved greatness in their chosen fields.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of the hierarchy, a damehood is the female equivalent of a knighthood, so the title of Dame is equivalent to Sir. It&#039;s the most senior honour in the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, which was created in 1917 by King George V. The order comprises five classes across both civil and military divisions, and many dames hold other honours (such as an OBE or an MBE) before receiving their damehood.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Though many of the dames who instantly come to mind may be those in the fields of sport and entertainment - Judi Dench, &lt;a class=&quot;sugar-inline-link&quot; title=&quot;Latest photos and news for Helen Mirren&quot; href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/Helen-Mirren&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Helen Mirren&lt;/a&gt;, Maggie Smith, Kelly Holmes, and Jessica Ennis, to name but a few - a lot of the women who receive the honour are less well-known outside of their own industry or specialism. Dames can be judges or journalists, politicians or philanthropists. Many honours are given to those working in academia and research, as well as those holding senior positions at large companies and corporations. In recent years, new dames have included everyone from a mezzo soprano to the former managing director of a publishing house.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, the order is not without its controversies, and a number of high-profile recipients have chosen to decline the honour over the years. Some object to the monarchy, some disapprove of the hierarchy of the system itself, some disagree with previous recipients (for political or ethical reasons, for example). Many choose to decline privately, but a number of those who&#039;ve done so publicly have stated that they feel uncomfortable being associated with an Empire that caused so much suffering through colonisation. Vanessa Redgrave, who turned down a damehood in 1999, told &lt;strong&gt;The Independent&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/vanessa-redgrave-nothing-like-a-dame-183707.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;my difficulty is in receiving anything that says British Empire, because I am a Unicef special representative at the service of children from any country.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Those who do accept the honour receive it from a senior member of the royal family (usually the Queen, Prince Charles, or Prince William) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Dame-Julie-Walters-Helen-McCrory-OBE-Investitures-44232210&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;during an Investiture ceremony&lt;/a&gt; that traditionally takes place at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle. Here are 30 amazing recipients from recent years, many of whom you might recognise.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/F*cking Awesome Females\">F*cking Awesome Females</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/British Celebrities\">British Celebrities</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Julie Walters\">Julie Walters</category>\n <has-gallery></has-gallery>\n <pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 17:30:27 +0000</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Gemma Cartwright</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">44560741</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>What Is a Dame?</search_title>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title>Stop and Take a Selfie Right Now Because This App Finds Your Celebrity Twin</title>\n <link>https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/What-POPSUGAR-Twinning-App-44583299</link>\n <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/What-POPSUGAR-Twinning-App-44583299&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;160&quot; height=&quot;84&quot; src=&quot;https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/UPrh-CL20EkldjKarQH30SYQDec/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/02/13/046/n/1922398/fe22ba735a837dca299052.21877953_edit_img_cover_file_44580323_1518565203.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get ready to stop and take a selfie right now because there&#039;s a new site that&#039;s about to take over your damn life. POPSUGAR&#039;s very own &lt;a href=&quot;https://twinning.popsugar.com/&quot; &gt;#Twinning tool&lt;/a&gt; has become one of those addictive things that we can&#039;t help trying . . . then trying again, and again after that. Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/tech/How-Use-Google-Arts-Culture-Face-Match-44508361&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google&#039;s viral Arts and Culture Face Match&lt;/a&gt;, it&#039;s not quite a game, not quite a meme, but you&#039;ll definitely want to share the results of your celebrity twin matches with friends. Some of them are perfect; some look nothing like you - and that&#039;s the fun of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;pullquote-container&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;It&#039;s simple: #Twinning analyses a selfie or uploaded photo, then compares it to a massive database of celebrity photos to find matches, and finally presents your top five look-alikes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The tool itself is pretty simple: it analyses a selfie or uploaded photo, compares it to a massive database of celebrity photos to find matches, and finally gives you a &quot;twinning percentage&quot; for your top five look-alikes. You might pair with a famous politician, an old-school Hollywood starlet, or a reality TV personality, and the results will vary based on which photo you upload!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Because of this, I&#039;ve found myself repeatedly trying #Twinning with different angles, hairstyles, lighting, and makeup levels. (Maybe I&#039;m just waiting for the tool to recognise me as Natalie Portman&#039;s long-lost sister? Who&#039;s to say! I&#039;m fine, I&#039;m totally fine.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All across my office, you can hear POPSUGAR employees cackling with laughter over their matches. Do I really look like my mum&#039;s favourite &#039;90s soap star? You&#039;re a 35-year-old woman - how on earth is Jacob Tremblay your match? And at press time, nearly 50K people have found their twins in the database, so the rest of the world is clearly beginning to take notice!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Check out some of POPSUGAR&#039;s very own celebrity matches ahead, then prepare to be hooked when you &lt;a href=&quot;https://twinning.popsugar.com/&quot; &gt;try the free tool yourself&lt;/a&gt;.

The couple shared an instagram snap in which they are holding the scan of their first child. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Olympic diver Tom began dating Lance, Oscar-winning screenwriter and filmmaker, in 2013. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Tom-Daley-Engaged-38611724&quot; &gt;They announced their engagement in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, and  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Tom-Daley-Dustin-Lance-Black-Wedding-Pictures-43515269&quot; &gt;married in May 2017 at Bovey Castle Hotel in Dartmoor National Park in Devon&lt;/a&gt;. Their wedding featured a special performance by the London Gay Men&#039;s Chorus, and Tom also apparently recreated the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet, professing his love for Lance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This will be the first child for the couple, who live together in London. They&#039;ve yet to confirm when the baby is due, or give any further details on their growing family.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Tom Daley\">Tom Daley</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Dustin Lance Black\">Dustin Lance Black</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Celebrity Pregnancies\">Celebrity Pregnancies</category>\n <pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 15:00:04 +0000</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Gemma Cartwright</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">44583441</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>Tom Daley and Dustin Lance Black Expecting First Child</search_title>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title>These Snaps of Prince Harry Playing With Kids Prove He&#039;s Going to Make an Amazing Dad Someday</title>\n <link>https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Prince-Harry-Playing-Kids-During-Fit-Fed-Visit-2018-44589053</link>\n <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Prince-Harry-Playing-Kids-During-Fit-Fed-Visit-2018-44589053&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;107&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; src=&quot;https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/GWzgQXE4lGaO2VgIsfL6G529lrA/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/02/15/812/n/1922398/b6a9c7b1223c9df1_GettyImages-918614844.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Reasons-We-Love-Prince-Harry-44586332&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reasons we love Prince Harry&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Meghan-Markle-Calling-Prince-Harry-Feminist-Video-44510838&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he&#039;s a proud feminist&lt;/a&gt;, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Prince-Harry-Dogs-Pictures-44095584&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;loves animals&lt;/a&gt;, he&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Prince-Harry-GIFs-43929805&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;easy on the eyes&lt;/a&gt;, like, extremely easy, but ultimately, it&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Photos-Prince-Harry-Kids-42762362&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;his adorable way with kids&lt;/a&gt; that really does it for us.

It&#039;s not my life&#039;s calling.&quot; Guess that&#039;s all changed now.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n</description>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Sabrina Dhowre\">Sabrina Dhowre</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Celebrity Facts\">Celebrity Facts</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Celebrity Couples\">Celebrity Couples</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Idris Elba\">Idris Elba</category>\n <pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 13:55:03 +0000</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Monica Sisavat</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">44577471</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>Who Is Idris Elba&#039;s Fiancee, Sabrina Dhowre?</search_title>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title>The Queen Is Determined to Make the Royal Household More Eco-Friendly</title>\n <link>https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Queen-Bans-Plastic-Straws-Bottles-Palace-44574860</link>\n <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Queen-Bans-Plastic-Straws-Bottles-Palace-44574860&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;160&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; src=&quot;https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/zFfYmUz1nFobFJUNZBK8y8BjnL8/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/02/12/615/n/44344579/64fb89765a819a86eba343.70867913_edit_img_image_44574860_1518441033.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Queen Elizabeth II is spearheading a campaign to rid Buckingham Palace and other royal estates of unnecessary plastic, starting with bottles and straws. According to &lt;strong&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/11/queen-declares-war-plastic-david-attenborough-documentary/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;her majesty was inspired to make the palaces a little more environmentally friendly&lt;/a&gt; after working with Sir David Attenborough on a conservation documentary about wildlife in the Commonwealth. Her son, Prince Charles, has no doubt also voiced his concerns. He founded the International Sustainability Unit in 2010, and in January &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2018/01/31/prince-charles-nightmare-plastic-oceans-will-get-worse/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he spoke in public about his concern for the amount of plastic making its way into our oceans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As part of this initiative, it&#039;s reported that caterers at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, and Holyroodhouse will only be allowed to use china plates and glasses or recyclable paper cups from now on. Takeaway items in cafes on the estates must also now be put in compostable or biodegradable packaging. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is just one of many initiatives in the UK to tackle the huge amount of waste produced annually. In October 2015, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/single-use-plastic-carrier-bags-why-were-introducing-the-charge/carrier-bags-why-theres-a-5p-charge&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a law was passed that required large retailers (those with a staff of over 250 people) to charge for plastic carrier bags&lt;/a&gt; with the hopes of encouraging more people to carry reusable shoppers. Chains like JD Wetherspoons &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/plastic-straws-jd-wetherspoons-environment-campaign-recycling-refuse-the-straw-all-bar-one-a7969791.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;have pledged to stop the &quot;wasteful&quot; use of plastic straws&lt;/a&gt;.

But if that falls through, our diary is free.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The moving performance took place during a reception for young people at the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the queen&#039;s official residence in Scotland. 50 young people, all involved in the Scottish Government&#039;s Year of Young People 2018, were in attendance to meet the Prince and his fianc\u00e9e. One singer said that Meghan looked like she was going to cry as the group performed an acoustic version of the ballad, which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Ed-Sheeran-Songs-Weddings-40752858&quot;&gt;a famously popular choice for first dances at weddings&lt;/a&gt;.
