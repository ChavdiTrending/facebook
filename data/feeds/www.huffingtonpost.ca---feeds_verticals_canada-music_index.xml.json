The revelations about Hollywood producer <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-accused-harvey-weinstein_us_59deb31ee4b00abf36463835\">Harvey Weinstein</a> and subsequent #MeToo campaign are just some of the latest examples of high-profile news stories empowering women to seek help.</p><p>Canada's public reckoning with sexual violence began in 2014, when CBC host <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2014/10/26/cbc_fires_jian_ghomeshi_over_sex_allegations.html\">Jian Ghomeshi was accused</a> of punching, slapping and choking women until they almost lost consciousness during sexual encounters. Subsequent social media campaigns like #BeenRapedNeverReported and #YesAllWomen highlighted the experiences of sexual assault survivors.</p><p><img alt=\"A protester is detained by police after an Ontario judge found Jian Ghomeshi not guilty of five criminal charges in Toronto on March 24, 2016. \" data-caption=\"A protester is detained by police after an Ontario judge found Jian Ghomeshi not guilty of five criminal charges in Toronto on March 24, 2016. \" data-credit=\"Mark Blinch/Reuters\" data-mep=\"2457482\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=4258%2C2900%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=630%2C429&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F7e7c596655bbcd8cfa7a9482f42c9c4a%2F203702468%2FRTSC3ZI.jpeg&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=935421935fb8e9dcdff8e100623e63d6ced1bf9d\" /></p><p>\"Everytime there's a public spotlight put on sexual assault, whether it's <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/news/jian-ghomeshi/\">Jian Ghomeshi</a> or #YesAllWomen, there's always a surge in the number of callers that we get,\" said Sambriddhi Nepal, manager of fund development for Vancouver's WAVAW Rape Crisis Centre. \"What's different about #MeToo is this is the first time you've seen a hashtag like this really gain traction but then keep a sustained amount of traction.\"</p><p><strong>More than 100,000 seek services every year</strong></p><p>It's impossible to know for sure how widespread sexual assault and abuse is in Canada today. Statistics Canada's <a href=\"http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2017001/article/14842-eng.htm\">most recent numbers</a>, based on self-reporting, estimate that there were 636,000 sexual assaults in Canada in 2014. Eighty-seven per cent of victims were women. The rate, 22 incidents for every 1,000 Canadians, has remained unchanged since 2004.</p><p>Five per cent of these incidents were reported to police. Seventeen per cent of victims surveyed said they sought support services through a crisis line, rape crisis centre, victims services or community centre. <b><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></b>That means at least 108,000 survivors of sexual assault are seeking services each year, and the number is rising.</p><p>In the 1970s and '80s, women started rape crisis centres and support lines on their own time in basements and shelters. In the 1990s and early 2000s, many began to receive government funding for the first time. But this funding often comes from short-term grants or is linked to temporary projects.</p><p>There is one national association for these centres, the Canadian Association of Sexual Assault Centres (CASAC). The association has no staff and has never received operational funding from the federal government.</p><p><em>Video: #MeToo rocks Canadian politics</em></p><p><!-- TAG START { player: \"* CA Play In Place Autoplay \", owner: \"AOL Canada\", for: \"AOL Canada\" } --></p><div contenteditable=\"false\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"vdb_player vdb_58e28f10c214e34d93b12069564e003d67b62214082cc703\" data-placeholder=\"//img.vidible.tv/prod/2018-01/26/5a6ba30ab90afb7b6f054658/5a6ba310300f9531376b429b_o_A_v2.jpg?w=1440&amp;h=900\" id=\"58e28f10c214e34d93b12069\" vdb_params=\"m.embeded=cms_video_plugin\"><img src=\"https://img.vidible.tv/prod/2018-01/26/5a6ba30ab90afb7b6f054658/5a6ba310300f9531376b429b_o_A_v2.jpg\" style=\"display:none;\" /><script src=\"//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=58e28f10c214e34d93b12069/vid=5a6ba30ab90afb7b6f054658/564e003d67b62214082cc703.js?m.embeded=cms_video_plugin\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></div></div><p><!-- TAG END { date: 02/15/18 } --></p><p>\"We've been pressing at least since the early '80s for operational funding for national women's groups,\" said Louisa Russell, a frontline worker at Vancouver Rape Relief and Women's Shelter, a CASAC member agency.</p><p>Russell said that governments across Canada prefer to fund victim service agencies over rape crisis centres. Victim service agencies are police-based or community-based and funded by the government. They provide support immediately after an attack, but don't do the feminist advocacy work that rape crisis centres do, Russell said.</p><blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote\">We've helped two women now bring civil cases against the RCMP for refusing to arrest the men that went on to injure them. That's the kind of work a rape crisis centre does.</span><span class=\"attribution\" style=\"display:block;\">Louisa Russell</span></blockquote><p>Victim services sometimes refer clients to rape crisis centres for services they can't provide, like hospital accompaniment, court accompaniment and long-term counselling, Russell said.</p><p>\"We've helped two women now bring civil cases against the RCMP for refusing to arrest the men that went on to injure them,\" she said. \"That's the kind of work a rape crisis centre does. And that's the kind of work that's not being funded adequately.\"</p><p>Crisis centres have successfully advocated for major legislative changes, like altering Canada's legal definition of consent and giving a complainant the ability to protect her counselling records from being subpoenaed for trial.</p><p><img alt=\"Balloons are pictured during the Women's March in Ottawa on Jan. 21, 2017.\" data-caption=\"Balloons are pictured during the Women's March in Ottawa on Jan. 21, 2017.\" data-credit=\"Chris Wattie/Reuters\" data-mep=\"2457483\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=3854%2C2569%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=630%2C420&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Ff807946b2cf57dd4ae43c49c677d5b26%2F206131122%2FRTSWQBS.jpeg&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=f033723c499de3dd863d2372f695ac2b5d212419\" /></p><p>But none of the crisis workers interviewed by HuffPost Canada said their centre was sufficiently funded to meet the needs of survivors, let alone lobby the federal government for legislative change.</p><p>Most centres work independently and lobby their provincial government for funding. Some provinces, including Ontario, Alberta and Saskatchewan, have provincial networks to share information and advocate as a group.</p><p>Every province and territory has a different political climate and funding model. CASAC lets rape crisis workers discuss common challenges and stories in the media. But locally, these centres have to figure out funding themselves.</p><p><strong>'1990s level' funding in Ontario</strong></p><p>Rape crisis centres in Ontario have a provincial coordinator who lobbies the provincial government for funding.</p><p>\"Historically, this has been an extremely under-funded sector, and that continues until today. Just because Ghomeshi happened and Cosby happened and Weinstein and #MeToo and #TimesUp and all that, that doesn't mean we get any increase in funding,\" said Ontario Coalition of Rape Crisis Centres co-ordinator Nicole Pietsch. \"Our centres will say they continue to be funded at a 1990s level.\"</p><p>Pietsch notes that Ontario's centres are among the best resourced in the country. The province supports them with core funding &mdash; consistent money that can be counted on and used to budget for basic costs like rent and salaries.</p><p>\"The [Kathleen] Wynne government has cared more about sexual violence than any government ever. There's political will we've never seen,\" she said. \"That's a good thing, but our agencies still struggle to meet the needs of survivors.\"</p><p><strong>No reliable funding for Vancouver centre</strong></p><p>In British Columbia, Nepal said that her centre often has to fundraise just to keep the lights on. The centre scrapes together short-term grants, project funding and private donations in order to provide a 24-hour crisis line, hospital accompaniment services, free counselling, support groups and a program for Indigenous women.</p><p>In 2016, <a href=\"http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/haip/srch/t3010form22quickview-eng.action?r=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cra-arc.gc.ca%3A80%2Febci%2Fhaip%2Fsrch%2Fadvancedsearchresult-eng.action%3Fn%3Dw.a.v.a.w.%26amp%3Bb%3D%26amp%3Bq%3D%26amp%3Bs%3Dregistered%26amp%3Bd%3D%26amp%3Be%3D%2B%26amp%3Bc%3D%26amp%3Bv%3D%2B%26amp%3Bo%3D%26amp%3Bz%3D%26amp%3Bg%3D%2B%26amp%3Bt%3D%2B%26amp%3By%3D%2B%26amp%3Bp%3D1&amp;fpe=2017-03-31&amp;b=892504366RR0001&amp;n=W.A.V.A.W./R.C.C.:WOMENAGAINSTVIOLENCEAGAINSTWOMEN/RAPECRISISCENTRE\">WAVAW Rape Crisis Centre received</a> $727,909 in government funding and $802,730 in donations. None of the government money is core funding that can be used for basic expenses. It's all tied to specific projects.</p><p>\"There's lots of support for survivors circulating online, but we really call for this support to move offline in more systemic ways,\" Nepal said. \"More and more survivors are coming forward, but what's going to happen next? To see lasting change, we need to be able to provide support to everyone that calls. At this rate we won't be able to do that.\"</p><blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote\">There's lots of support for survivors circulating online, but we really call for this support to move offline in more systemic ways.</span><span class=\"attribution\" style=\"display:block;\">Sambriddhi Nepal</span></blockquote><p>She said that her centre has an 18-month wait list for one-on-one counselling. That was recently reduced from two years, after an upswing in donations let them hire a new staff member.</p><p>The media spotlight on sexual violence has made the community more supportive, Nepal said.</p><p>\"It's not lost on the community that this is really important,\" she said. \"I think if you were to take a gauge of the community as a whole, they would find it appalling that survivors are waiting for a year and a half to access counselling.

WAVAW Rape Crisis Centre receives hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding for specific projects, spokesman Colin Hynes said in an email.</p><p>\"This government is committed to ensuring vulnerable women and children get the quality services they need in a timelier manner,\" Hynes said. \"However, we also recognize that service providers for victims of domestic violence, sexual violence and other violent crimes have experienced challenges meeting service demands in communities throughout B.C.\"</p><p><b>Alberta sees demand double</b></p><p><b>\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b</b>In Alberta, Tomlinson said that she's waiting to hear if the government will include new funding in its 2018 budget. Her association receives $8.5 million from the province and has requested $6.5 million more to keep up with the increased demand.</p><p>She said that even before the #MeToo campaign exploded, sexual assault centres there were seeing a dramatic increase in need.</p><blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote\">I've been in the field over 25 years now and I've never seen this before.</span><span class=\"attribution\" style=\"display:block;\">Deb Tomlinson</span></blockquote><p>On average, the 12 centres in Alberta see about 1,700 new counselling clients annually. But in the fiscal year ending March 2017, that number was 3,510 &mdash; more than double the average.</p><p>\"I've been in the field over 25 years now and I've never seen this before,\" Tomlinson said. \"The problem now is that our sexual assault services are very, very pressured to meet this demand ... We have waitlists now at our centres, some as high as nine months.</p><p>\"If you think about someone who has hesitated to reach out, hesitated to speak out, gets up the courage to pick up the phone and ask for help, only to be told that they're going to be put on a very long waitlist, that's not okay. That's not addressing the problem of sexual violence,\" she said.</p><p><b>Eight to 12-month wait list in Nova Scotia</b></p><p>In Halifax, executive director of the Avalon Centre Jackie Stevens said that her organization is very limited in how it can respond to sexual violence, which she says is complex and deeply entrenched in our society.</p><p>The Avalon Centre receives funding from Nova Scotia's Department of Community Services but it hasn't increased in four or five years, Stevens said.</p><p>\"When funding doesn't increase, it doesn't take into account the cost of living, the fact that rent changes from year to year ... you can't pay someone the same salary for 20 years.\"</p><p>Their wait lists for counselling vary, Stevens said, but for adult survivors of childhood abuse it is eight to 12 months. They try to see survivors of recent sexual assault within about a week. But when there's a surge in calls, the waitlist for survivors of historical abuse grows even longer.</p><blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote\">You can't pay someone the same salary for 20 years.</span><span class=\"attribution\" style=\"display:block;\">Jackie Stevens</span></blockquote><p>They've seen an increase in calls about both recent assaults and historical abuse.</p><p>When sexual violence is in the media, there's an increase in victims seeking help, which puts a strain on all aspects of the centre's work, Stevens said. They do more advocacy, unpaid consultation for governments and help businesses respond to incidents in the workplace. She said this is happening across the country.</p><p><img alt=\"The Avalon Centre's annual report for 2016-2017 shows that it's providing counselling for more than twice as many sexual assault victims as it did ten years ago.\" data-caption=\"The Avalon Centre's annual report for 2016-2017 shows that it's providing counselling for more than twice as many sexual assault victims as it did ten years ago.\" data-credit=\"Avalon Centre\" data-mep=\"2457485\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=650%2C238%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=630%2C231&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fe092bd21c1807dd15fd7d215833ddf33%2F206131438%2Fhalifax%2Bavalon%2Bcentre.png&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=ccf5981506fa11b371c21b02b97bf1a3623338eb\" /></p><p>\"People who never had waitlists suddenly have waitlists ...

Did that victim do everything correctly? Does she deserve to be believed?\"</p><p><strong>'Our agencies live in fear'</strong></p><p>That rhetoric underlies both the public's conversation and politicians' willingness to address the issue, she said.</p><p>\"You're really vulnerable to the climate politically,\" Pietsch said. \"In the 1990s, when Mike Harris was the Conservative premier, all kinds of social services got cut, particularly women's services. Our agencies live in fear of a time like that ...

Now everyone is like, 'Yes, cool, he got a bronze medal' but would that (a crash) have made me less of a hard-working person?\" he said. \"I don't think so. For me the medal isn't necessarily what I was going for.</p><p>\"Had the others landed and bumped me into fourth or fifth place I would have been happy anyway because I skied the best in my life today.\"</p><p>Beaulieu-Marchand hopes his success will make other kids want to take up the sport.</p><p>\"Hopefully it's inspired a new generation to come and have fun with us on the slopes,\" he

Aftershocks had caused people to flee their homes for fear they would collapse.</p><p>The Defence Department said the Blackhawk helicopter suffered the mishap when it was preparing to land on a vacant lot in the city of Jamiltepec, about 19 miles from the area of Pinotepa Nacional. The craft was carrying Interior Secretary Alfonso Navarrete and Oaxaca Gov. Alejandro Murat, neither of whom had serious injuries. The department said the victims had been waiting for the helicopter, but did not provide more details.</p><p>The accident was the latest embarrassment in little more than a month since Navarrete took over at the Interior Department, which oversees most political and security issues. Earlier this month, an intelligence agent from an agency overseen by Navarrete's department was caught tailing an opposition presidential candidate.</p><p>Both Navarrete and the defence department said they regretted the loss of life in Friday's accident.</p><p><img alt=\"Soldiers are seen next to remains of the military helicopter that fell on a van in Santiago Jamiltepec, Oaxaca state, Mexico, on Saturday.\" data-caption=\"Soldiers are seen next to remains of the military helicopter that fell on a van in Santiago Jamiltepec, Oaxaca state, Mexico, on Saturday.\" data-credit=\"PATRICIA CASTELLANOS via Getty Images\" data-mep=\"2462310\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=3324%2C2067%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=630%2C392&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fd000610fb2e3dff49a49462f156d56d4%2F206136422%2Fsoldiers-are-seen-next-to-remains-of-the-military-helicopter-that-on-picture-id919324910&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=5def11757b5e067b5e99fd0381d216bbb979bcd3\" /></p><p>The same city where the accident occurred also saw significant destruction from the earthquake.

other pulse crops.</p><p>A duty of 30 per cent was applied to chickpeas and lentils just before Christmas and was raised to 40 per cent on February 6, with the Indian government citing falling international market prices for the crops, abundant production elsewhere and a negative impact on Indian producers and domestic Indian prices of cheap imports.</p><p>A 50 per cent import duty was applied to yellow peas in November.</p><p>Conservative International Trade Critic Dean Allison was critical of Trudeau Friday for not including Canadian Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay on this trip to try and address the import duties. Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, Small Business and Tourism Minister Bardish Chagger, Science Minister Kirsty Duncan and Infrastructure Minister Amarjeet Sohi all travelled with Trudeau to India. Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland and Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan will meet him in the country.</p><p><img alt=\"Justin Trudeau, accompanied by his wife and their children, arrives at New Delhi, India on Saturday.\" data-caption=\"Justin Trudeau, accompanied by his wife and their children, arrives at New Delhi, India on Saturday.\" data-credit=\"EPA\" data-mep=\"2462299\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=3069%2C4436%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=630%2C911&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Ffc7e8172d40e7c0eaa16b1835ac48d7a%2F206136335%2F18566552.jpg&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=f6cf680e420333c8afc306adf7a00200320e388a\" /></p><p>Allison said Trudeau needs to explain what he plans to do to fight these duties when he isn't bringing his agriculture minister to the table, given that India is an important export market for Canadian pulse producers.</p><p>Trade between India and China has more than doubled to $8.4 billion in the last decade.

He was largely responsible for leading the quad brigade &mdash; he was one of the first skaters to include two quads in a long program &mdash; but the other skaters cranked up the quad content in his absence.</p><p>Four of the six skaters in Saturday's group planned 15 quads between them.

It's a very funny concept.</p><p>\"I loved it. It's given me so many opportunities. I've been such a fortunate person. It set my life up. I feel so proud to be a skater.

last federal election in 2015 that has seen the NDP's budget fall from $18 million in 2015 to $6 million the last two years.</p><p>The trend is starting to reverse, said NDP treasurer Tania Jarzebiak, but the party still has $3 million in external debt from the last election, and owes money to many riding associations that will need the cash soon to start preparing for 2019.</p><p>But while the number of members grew to 124,000 during the leadership race that ended with Singh's election, only 30,000 of those members have donated to the party, Jarzebiak said, and only 9,000 were monthly donors, \"so we have work to do.\"</p><p><em>With files from Mylene Crete.</em></p><p><em><strong>Also on HuffPost:</strong></em></p><div class=\"vdb_player

But according to Moffit, there are three surefire ways to keep yourself in check during an argument.</p><p><strong>1. Always state the facts first</strong></p><p><img data-credit=\"Getty Images\" data-mep=\"2461093\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=6062%2C3907%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=630%2C406&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F8665e3ba2384495b3dea9706f928cc25%2F205693593%2Ftheyre-so-used-to-the-blame-game-already-picture-id667816572&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=d8c58fdff78226113ccec321dbad84c840d247c7\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>When someone does something to upset you &mdash; regardless of whether or not it's your partner &mdash; the natural instinct is to react with anger. However, it's important not to let your emotions get the best of you! Take a deep breath, and calmly state what the problem is.</p><p>One example Moffit used is: \"You left the toothpaste cap off last night again.\"</p><p>Stating the facts \"allows you to get to the bottom of the problem right away, without dwelling on past issues,\" she explained.</p><p><strong>2. Explain how your partner's action made you feel</strong></p><p><img data-credit=\"Getty Images/iStockphoto\" data-mep=\"2461094\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=5760%2C3840%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=630%2C420&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fe5bc45b26402a22e7f6a329e0b9c603%2F206134855%2Funhappy-lesbian-couple-sitting-on-sofa-picture-id701181670&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=e01d1499b276050003645307d0d7ccc9729e7942\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>It's natural for people to get defensive when their partner says something negative about them. For example, \"You forgot to pick up the dry cleaning\" or \"Your side of the bedroom is a mess.\" That's why explaining how your partner's action made you feel can create understanding between the two of you and help avoid a spiraling argument.</p><p>\"When I see the toothpaste cap off, it makes me very frustrated\" or \"I feel like we had this conversation a few times, but I am not being heard\" is a great example of explaining how you feel, Moffit said.</p><p>\"By doing this, you are not saying anything negative about the other person, but just describing what their action meant to you.\"</p><p><strong>3. Offer an alternate action that would make the situation better next time</strong></p><p><img data-credit=\"Geber86 via Getty Images\" data-mep=\"2461095\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=8574%2C5715%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=630%2C420&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fc6b49089384541a4a261d21418619175%2F206134863%2Ffinancial-problems-picture-id508297954&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=e098cb3133fcacccf633ca4a0fd7facb181a8578\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>Following the toothpaste analogy, Moffit offered this example: \"Maybe we should purchase a toothpaste dispenser?\"</p><p>\"This way you are demonstrating your partner that you are willing to work with them and helping him/her to come up with a solution to accommodate you,\" she explained.</p><p>At the end of the day, fighting fair really comes down to keeping your emotions in check and approaching arguments from a calm and civil manner.</p><blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote\">If you want your relationship to last, it's important to be on your best behaviour and avoid unnecessary fights</span></blockquote><p><strong>\"</strong>If you want your relationship to last, it's important to be on your best behaviour and avoid unnecessary fights,\" Moffit said. \"But when you do fight &mdash; fight fair! We always try so hard at the beginning of our relationship, but as we get comfortable, we stop paying attention to things that really matter to those we love most.\"</p><p>Moffit added that using this three-step approach to arguments can help keep your relationship healthy.</p><p>\"It helps partners work through the issue very quickly and avoid the snowball effect,\" she said. \"[And] it enhances trust and gives both partners a greater feeling of safety in their relationship.\"</p><p><strong><em>Also on HuffPost: </em></strong><!-- TAG START { player: \"* CA Play In Place Autoplay \", owner:

Images\"><p>By Mike Zigomanis, former NHL player</p><p>When I was 16 years old I chose to leave home. This decision was years in the making and had the full support of my mom and dad along with my two older sisters who had all sacrificed a lot to get me to this point.</p><p>The journey from Markham to Kingston was a major step in my pursuit of what some describe as the \"Canadian Dream\" &mdash; the chance to play in the NHL.</p><p>It is hard for me to contrast my circumstances with kids &mdash; sometimes younger than I was &mdash; having to flee their homes out of despair and fear.</p><p>I was leaving a loving home totally committed to seeing how far my hockey talent would take me and there are young people today, through no fault of their own, who are having to live on the streets and doing what ever they can to survive.</p><p>Some organizations are there to help but demand usually outstrips supply and kids are at risk of another round of disappointment.</p><p>As these young people leave their teen years there is a perception that as young adults they should be better equipped to fend for themselves. As a result, many necessary services may not be so easily available to them.</p><p>Contrast that with my situation as a 20-year-old winning a bronze medal at the World Junior Championships in Russia and getting ready to play in the NHL. The cruelty of fate has never been starker. Speak to any kid that is homeless and you hear the same message, \"I wish my life had been better.\"</p><p>Almost all of these kids just want some love and an opportunity. Sadly, at this point there are few who still hold onto their dreams. They are just trying to get through each day. As the experts will tell you, there is a high risk that the people who have the most influence at this stage are likely to be steering them in the wrong direction.</p><p>It is hard to believe that Canada has such a large homeless problem. It is possible you pass them on the streets, shop in the same stores, they may even be in the same schools as people you know but at the end of each day they do not go home.</p><p>Throughout my Major Junior and professional hockey career I had structure, I had family support and I had friendships. It is extremely difficult to understand the loneliness these kids must feel every day and their lack of hope.</p><p>The predicament they are in did not happen through choices they made but is due to happenstance. Given they did nothing wrong, surely we owe them the opportunity to something better?</p><p>It was hockey that raised my awareness about youth homelessness. After I retired, I was invited to take part in a pro-am charity event called Hockey Helps the Homeless. That led to a tour of the Hub at <a href=\"https://360kids.akaraisin.com/Common/Participant/Search.aspx?seid=15335&amp;mid=22\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">360&ordm;kids</a> and I saw for myself what is on offer.</p><p>It was also a point of realization about how large the problem is, and without more action from all of us, this issue will never go away.</p><p>When I was playing in Kingston, money was tight and I had to rely on financial support from my parents. But, I also knew my circumstances were temporary and if for some reason my career did not lead me to the NHL, I could go back home, and after a period of reflection, seek another opportunity.</p><p>It is hard for me to understand how young people can keep going without any hope.</p><p>Fate can offer you tremendous highs and it can also deliver some setbacks. Injuries shortened my career but at least I got the chance to fulfill my dream.</p><p>I was also able to play in some great cities with some fantastic players. I have my name etched on the Stanley Cup and as a Markham kid I was able to pull-on a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey. None of these things would have been possible without my family &mdash; it may sound like a clich&eacute; but it is true. Without their love and support, none of this would have been possible.</p><p>There are no guarantees in life, but all of us can make a difference. When a kid leaves home it should be to pursue a dream, not leave a nightmare. For those in such dreadful circumstances there needs to be somewhere they can turn to, so they don't feel alone, vulnerable and without a dream.</p><p><em>Mike Zigomanis is a former NHL player who is taking part in the 360&ordm;Experience, a fundraising event for 360&ordm;kids.</em></p>]]></description><link>http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/360akids/every-kid-deserves-a-chance-to-live-their-dream_a_23362757/</link><source_id>0SfWab</source_id><guid isPermalink=\"false\">23362757</guid><dc:creator>360\u2070kids</dc:creator><dc:publisher>AMP: HuffPost Canada</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Other</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 20:49:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1518814337070358000</ingested><modified>2018-02-16T20:49:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[homelessness]]></category><category><![CDATA[Living]]></category><category><![CDATA[youth homelessness]]></category><category><![CDATA[living]]></category><category><![CDATA[youth-homelessness]]></category><category><![CDATA[LIVING]]></category><media:content url=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/9f3d647eef4f7c2fcf396283c6270e08/206134691/mike-zigomanis-of-the-toronto-maple-leafs-shoots-during-warmup-before-picture-id104660671\" width=\"\" height=\"\" medium=\"image\"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Abelimages via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mike Zigomanis at the Air Canada Centre Oct. 2, 2010 in Toronto, Ont.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Former Ontario Cabinet Minister Accused Of Sex Assault By Ex-Staffer: Lawyer]]></title><description type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<img src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/4478x2239+731+829/resize/630x315!/format/jpg/quality/85/http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fa4d32b960de394d62e19d4a886983dd2%2F206134588%2F18354796.jpg\" alt=\"The Ontario legislature at Queen's Park is photographed on Sept. 5, 2017.\" data-caption=\"The Ontario legislature at Queen's Park is photographed on Sept. 5, 2017.\" data-credit=\"Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail\"><p>TORONTO &mdash; A former political staffer is alleging she was sexually assaulted by a Liberal member of Ontario's legislature when she was working for him more than a decade ago, the woman's lawyer said Friday.</p><p>John Nunziata, who represents the woman, said he is not willing to release the name of the accused, but identified him as a Liberal politician who once held a cabinet portfolio.</p><p>Premier Kathleen Wynne said no sexual misconduct allegations have ever been raised against cabinet members who served under her or her predecessor Dalton McGuinty.</p><p>Nunziata said his client, who once worked for the Liberal politician as an executive assistant, alleges the sexual misconduct took place around 2006 and 2007.<!-- TAG START { player: \"* CA Play In Place Autoplay \", owner: \"AOL Canada\", for: \"AOL Canada\" } --></p><div contenteditable=\"false\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"vdb_player vdb_58e28f10c214e34d93b12069564e003d67b62214082cc703\" data-placeholder=\"//img.vidible.tv/prod/2018-02/16/5a87272085eb4260e1e71182/5a872720f7766f34362810ee_o_F_v0.jpg?w=1584&amp;h=990\" id=\"58e28f10c214e34d93b12069\" vdb_params=\"m.embeded=cms_video_plugin_cms.publishing.oath.com\"><img src=\"https://img.vidible.tv/prod/2018-02/16/5a87272085eb4260e1e71182/5a872720f7766f34362810ee_o_F_v0.jpg\" style=\"display:none;\" /><script src=\"//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=58e28f10c214e34d93b12069/vid=5a87272085eb4260e1e71182,5a8633779e45100ba66fdaf3,5a6fd6958c08e035a9b1daf6,5a870a850c062d4e980afb06,5a86e9a4c74d4722e46619f3,5a80f2fb44a64b138ff39c6d,5a80c8a030066f466b7a7bb2/564e003d67b62214082cc703.js?m.embeded=cms_video_plugin_cms.publishing.oath.com\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></div></div><p><!-- TAG END { date: 02/16/18 } --></p><p>\"She's not doing this for the money or for fame,\" Nunziata said of his unnamed client in a telephone interview.</p><p>\"She has been hurt by this whole process.

And the publication deadline was literally hours away. As a \"suit\" versus a \"creative,\" I still took it upon myself to write some ad copy, which my boss reluctantly shared with the anxious client, who loved it.</p><p><img data-credit=\"Klaus Vedfelt via Getty Images\" data-mep=\"2460901\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=6019%2C4012%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=630%2C420&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F6ea1f066f1f4c58982528dacb1ad1267%2F206134575%2Fbusinessmen-jumping-and-cheering-in-silhuet-picture-id683773784&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=9309e00ef3b30874ae5e27c4c8d57712e2938fbd\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>My copy won the day for the agency, but made my boss look bad. It appeared that he had lost control of the situation by letting me solve the problem instead of having the creative team create the ad. My relationship with my boss never recovered.</p><p>Most organizations preach a \"credit where credit is due\" policy among employees. Management often rewards individuals for coming up with cost-saving improvements and other ideas about how to make the organization a better place to work and more profitable. The environment can become competitive with everyone vying for promotions, pay increases and the favour of senior management. Egos will almost always be in play, as with the ad agency where the question of <em>who</em> actually solved the client's creative challenge became more important than the fact that the agency finally fixed the problem &mdash; and kept the business.</p><blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote\">If its immediate and positive impact is obvious, your boss may be more inclined to use it. </span></blockquote><p>When presenting an idea to your boss, it's wise to consider six things:</p><p><strong>Best for you or the business</strong></p><p>Is your idea based on solving an existing problem or building on an opportunity that will help your business? If its immediate and positive impact is obvious, your boss may be more inclined to use it. However, if it appears to promote your best interests first, then rethink sharing it.</p><p><strong>Assess the risk level</strong></p><p>Is your boss on solid ground or is she being watched closely due to lacklustre performance? If it's the former, she may be willing to try out your idea as she can afford to take a risk. If it's the latter, ensure that your idea is essentially bulletproof (largely risk free) and will make her look good.</p><p><strong>Timing is everything</strong></p><p>Timing the sharing of your idea is just as important as its benefits. Trying to get your boss' full attention in pressure-filled moments will be difficult. Even worse, you may irritate him with your lack of sensitivity to his stress. Rather, arrange to meet for coffee in a relaxed setting and give him several scheduling options. Based on his schedule and mood, he may unexpectedly say, \"I am free now. Let's talk.\" Agree to meet then and there only if you are fully prepared.</p><p>In my enthusiasm, I have presented a \"half-baked\" idea only to be asked to come back with the answers I should have prepared. (I felt the wind leave my sails when I had to go back a second time.) Not thinking through key details reduces the chances of him liking your idea and can hurt your credibility, which can be hard to restore.</p><blockquote><h2><strong>More career advice from Evan Thompson:</strong></h2><br /><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/evan-thompson/be-honest-with-yourself-before-attempting-to-change-careers_a_23336190/?utm_campaign=canada_dau\" target=\"_hplink\">Be Honest With Yourself Before Attempting To Change Careers</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/evan-thompson/heres-how-to-smooth-things-over-with-a-boss-who-cant-stand-you_a_23323035/?utm_campaign=canada_dau\" target=\"_hplink\">Here's How To Smooth Things Over With A Boss Who Can't Stand You</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/evan-thompson/an-introvert-s-guide-to-surviving-office-holiday-parties_a_23300309/?utm_campaign=canada_dau\" target=\"_hplink\">An Introvert's Guide To Surviving Office Holiday Parties</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><strong>Confidence is key</strong></p><p>My success in pitching an idea to a boss or client has always come from covering the details and my confidence in my idea. My body language reflects this confidence. Rather than taking a \"take it or leave it\" stance, I weigh her business role, personal likes and dislikes as well as current state of the organization or business.</p><p><strong>Consider your organizational position</strong></p><p>Instead of suggesting that my idea is a natural and can't-miss strategy for our organization, I say something like, \"I've spent some time considering this idea and I'd appreciate your thoughts on how you see it benefiting our organization.\" If you are presenting to a boss who is preoccupied, consider saying, \"I appreciate your time and will be concise. Let me begin with the what, when, why and how behind my idea.\"</p><p><strong>Justify and walk away</strong></p><p>After covering the details, close by offering a succinct summary of the idea and its benefits. Here's an example:</p><blockquote><p>\"Our business is growing so fast that we have more clients than account people to manage their needs. Clients have complained about dealing with a different account person every time they contact us. I suggest that we designate one team member only to manage specific client files and act as their contact person for the long term. That way, our team members can focus on certain clients who will save time while building a deeper relationship with each team member. This will lead to increased sales as our team members get to know clients' needs more fully.\"</p></blockquote><p>Then, go silent and let your boss think. Avoid the temptation to say, \"Well?\" or \"What do you think?\" Silence is a powerful negotiating tool. And you will appear less anxious if you curb your enthusiasm for a response.</p><p>By seeking your boss' input, you are respecting his role in helping to ensure the success of the business, which is important to your ongoing relationship. If your pitch goes well, he may ask you to present to those higher in the organization. Again, remember to give credit where credit is due, especially when your boss listened carefully and offered ideas early on that make your idea even better.</p><p><em><strong>Also on

Consider These 4 Exercises Non-Negotiable]]></title><description type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>Too many of us take our bodies for granted. We assume we will be able to effortlessly do tomorrow what we can do today, or we see our bodies as they were 10 years ago rather than how they are now. I am not immune to this phenomenon. I constantly have to remind myself that I do not recover as I did in my 20s. I need more time between workouts and more \"self-care,\" such as stretching and massage, to maintain the same workout intensities.</p><p>Like it or not, bodies change with time. With age, our muscle and bone mass, metabolism, mobility, stamina and strength naturally decrease, unless we make a conscious effort to mitigate the changes.</p><p>Adopting a healthier lifestyle is often framed as being about getting stronger, but as you age, the first step is simply not to lose ground.</p><p>Your future self will be less sore, stiff and prone to injury and poor posture &mdash; and instead be healthier and happier &mdash; if you start an appropriate exercises routine now!</p><p>I've hand-picked four types of exercise that, while ideal for everyone, should be thought of as \"non-negotiable\" after 35. They will mitigate the typical changes that occur with age.</p><p>Why 35? Really, the age to start is the age you are NOW. If you're 30, start now. If you're 40, start now. If you're 70, now!</p><p>I say 35 because these types of exercises (balance, mobility training, etc.) are too often thought of as only imperative after maybe age 45 or 50; but remember, it is always easier to \"keep up than to catch up.\" By starting early, you are setting yourself up for health success; you are increasing bone and muscle mass before either have started their decline and creating a \"bank\" you can add to or draw from if needed as you age. And don't think you can \"opt out\" of these exercises because you are a runner or a cyclist, or play sports daily. Exercise is only a positive stress on the body if given the tools to recover and the strength to properly produce the motions.</p><p>Don't put off to tomorrow what you can do today. Start now!</p><p><img data-credit=\"Charles Ebbs\" src=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/760d4a2b627e601e3070092e68012a20/206134524/Image-5.png\" data-mep=\"2460868\" alt=\"\" data-provider=\"other\" data-provider-asset-id=\"206134524\" /></p><h1>Squat</h1><p>Maintaining the ability &mdash; both the strength and the mobility &mdash; to squat is imperative! We squat innumerable times every day. Think about it. You squat to go to the bathroom, to sit down and get up, to get in and out of the car, and even to sit down into bed. It is almost impossible to function if you can't squat, but to produce the movement pattern, you need hip, knee and ankle mobility, as well as lower-body and core strength. Including squats as a non-negotiable part of your workout routine helps maintain this mobility and strength.</p><p>The squat is, in my opinion, the most fundamental strength exercise, but really strength exercises in general should be non-negotiable. Strength training increases lean muscle mass, helps to decrease the risk of osteoporosis, maintains the integrity of joints and mitigates decreases in bone and muscle mass. Don't just squat. Incorporate a range of multi-joint functional exercises; try deadlifts and rows, for example.</p><p>Tips on squatting: Start with your feet hip-distance apart. Bend at your knees, hips and ankles so that you sit backwards &mdash; as if you were sitting in a chair. As you sit, imagine your sit bones widening at the back. Watch your knees &mdash; make sure they track over your middle toes. Engage your bum and core to stand up.</p><h1>Single-leg exercises</h1><p>Walking and running require single-leg stability. Since walking is key for functional fitness and independence, to avoid injury I suggest training your muscles to support your body on one leg. Single-leg exercises train the body to balance, dissipate forces and provide feedback to the brain about the body's position in space.</p><p>Try standing on one leg. Once that is easy, close your eyes and/or do a single-leg hinge: stand on your right leg, chest out. Hinge forward, keeping your back flat. Keep your left hip down toward the floor as you hinge your chest forward. Use your right bum muscles to stand up. Repeat five or more times. Switch legs.</p><p><img data-credit=\"Charles Ebbs\" src=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/1ffbe288d235b933dfc2da7a8fcd6d30/206134517/Image-2.png\" data-mep=\"2460869\" alt=\"\" data-provider=\"other\" data-provider-asset-id=\"206134517\" /></p><h1>Multi-directional strength and mobility exercises</h1><p>We are not robots, but with age our bodies often start to feel stiff. The body becomes less subtle; we lose the ability to easily rotate, bend, step or lean sideways, and react with multi-directional movements. This lack of agility not only feels terrible, but it can contribute to injuries from doing simple tasks like rotating to get something from the backseat or reaching for something awkwardly placed. The solution? Try activities such as dancing, sports that require multi-directional motion, like tennis, and/or multi-direction strength exercises such as side lunges.</p><p>Side lunges: step your right leg sideways. Sit backwards into the right leg &mdash; as if your right bum is squatting into a chair. Keep your left leg straight. Keep your chest out and shoulders back. Engage your right bum muscles to power you back up to standing.</p><p><img data-credit=\"Charles Ebbs\" src=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/858f0501611645c0b4ced042446d03ca/206134519/Image-3.png\" data-mep=\"2460870\" alt=\"\" data-provider=\"other\" data-provider-asset-id=\"206134519\" /></p><h1>Cardio</h1><p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/kathleen-trotter/interval-workouts_b_3041611.html\" target=\"_blank\">Interval training </a>improves cardiovascular health, places a high metabolic demand on the body, burns lots of calories in a short amount of time, produces a high EPOC (post-workout calorie burn), increases mitochondrial growth (mitochondria help to burn fat) and helps improve one's fitness level.</p><p>On any cardio machine try rolling intervals: once warmed up, alternate one minute easy, one minute moderate, and one minute hard for nine to 15 minutes. Alternatively, try jumping rope or high-intensity body-weight cardio exercises such as burpees or jumping jacks.</p><p><img data-credit=\"Charles Ebbs\" src=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/fe65ef795d35c28fdf550b9ef91e315e/206134522/Image-4.png\" data-mep=\"2460871\" alt=\"\" data-provider=\"other\" data-provider-asset-id=\"206134522\" /></p><p>Regardless of age, embrace the \"today not tomorrow\" message. Your body will not maintain its current strength, stamina and mobility without conscious effort. If you like other forms of exercise, by all means do what you love; but make sure you also including these \"non-negotiables,\" starting today!</p>]]></description><link>http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/kathleen-trotter/exercise-tips-35-older_a_23363694/</link><source_id>0SfWab</source_id><guid isPermalink=\"false\">23363694</guid><dc:creator>Kathleen Trotter</dc:creator><dc:publisher>AMP: HuffPost Canada</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Other</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 19:45:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1518810569878553000</ingested><modified>2018-02-16T19:46:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Blogs]]></category><category><![CDATA[exercise]]></category><category><![CDATA[Living]]></category><category><![CDATA[blogs]]></category><category><![CDATA[living]]></category><category><![CDATA[LIVING]]></category><media:content url=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/eb2de7c8abd9c925bb27e7a9c9b8aa0d/206133987/Image-2.png\" width=\"\" height=\"\" medium=\"image\"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Charles Ebb]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/760d4a2b627e601e3070092e68012a20/206134524/Image-5.png\" width=\"\" height=\"\" medium=\"image\"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Charles Ebbs]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/1ffbe288d235b933dfc2da7a8fcd6d30/206134517/Image-2.png\" width=\"\" height=\"\" medium=\"image\"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[3]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Charles Ebbs]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/858f0501611645c0b4ced042446d03ca/206134519/Image-3.png\" width=\"\" height=\"\" medium=\"image\"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[4]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Charles Ebbs]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/fe65ef795d35c28fdf550b9ef91e315e/206134522/Image-4.png\" width=\"\" height=\"\" medium=\"image\"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[5]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Charles Ebbs]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Canada Must Step Up To Protect Children In War]]></title><description type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>One in six of the world's children live in conflict zones today, facing death, injury and abuse on a daily basis.</p><p>Imagine for a moment that your child, your little sister, your nephew, is numbed by the whistle of an airstrike, strangled by fear, and within a split second, trapped, in immense pain, under the rubble of school walls. This is a glimpse of reality for millions of children living in war.</p><p>Attacks against schools, killing and maiming of children, sexual violence, abductions and recruitment of child soldiers are just a few of the grave violations from which children in conflict are highly vulnerable.</p><p>A <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.ca/publication/war-on-children/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">new report</a> \"The War on Children: Time to End Violations Against Children in Armed Conflict,\" published by Save the Children, finds 357 million children in 42 countries are affected by conflict, up from \"only\" 200 million since the 1990s. This is 10 times the population of Canada. </p><p>Canada and other developed countries are doing some things right when it comes to helping children to cope with &mdash; or, better yet, to avoid &mdash; the horrors of the wars that wrack their homelands.</p><p>But clearly, there is more to be done.</p><p>Those children who survive war, like the thousands of refugees who make it to Canada, can rebuild their shattered lives, at home or elsewhere. But they will carry the scars of brutality forever.</p><p>Gaps in the global response to armed hostilities, combined with the changing nature of warfare, mean the harm is getting worse, not better.</p><p>The abundance of images of injured or dead children on our screens is not just because social media has changed the way we receive information. Since 2010, the number of United Nations -verified cases of children being killed and maimed has gone up by almost 300 per cent, while incidents of denial of humanitarian access have skyrocketed by more than 1500 per cent.</p><p>Many of these children are not just caught in the cross-fire or treated by combatants as expendable collateral damage, but deliberately and systematically targeted. They are bombed in their schools and their homes. They are abducted, tortured and recruited by armed groups to fight and to work as porters, cooks and sex slaves.</p><p>Having recently visited a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh, it is clear that rape and sexual assault remains prevalent as a weapon of war. The widespread stigma attached to such crimes, and lack of monitoring and reporting mechanisms, means it is an especially under-reported aspect of conflict.</p><p>Throughout history, both our government and the Canadian public have played a significant role in helping children in times of crisis and protecting children in war. In 2000, the Canadian government hosted the first ever International Conference on War-Affected Children, and established the UN's Group of Friends on Children and Armed Conflict, a group Canada continues to host today.</p><p>In the past year alone, Canada produced the world's first military doctrine on child soldiers, endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration to protect schools from attack during conflict, and launched the Vancouver Principles, a set of political commitments, endorsed by 50 countries, to prevent the recruitment of child soldiers in peacekeeping operations.</p><p>As the war on children continues to mount, Canada has an opportunity to step up once again, championing the implementation of the international rules-based order that aims to protect children, even in the deadliest of conflicts.</p><p>The War on Children report has a series of recommendations under four headings.</p><ol><li>We should prevent children from being put at risk. Let's invest in peace-building. According to the Global Peace Index 2017, every $1 invested in peace-building can lead to a $16 decline in the cost of armed conflict.</li><li>All governments must consistently uphold international laws and standards to protect children in conflict.</li><li>Perpetrators of violations of children's rights in conflict must be systematically held to account.</li><li>Humanitarian programmes to protect children in conflict and to rebuild shattered lives must be properly funded and supported.</li></ol><p>Save the Children's founder, Eglantyne Jebb, once said, \"All wars, just or unjust, disastrous or victorious, are waged against the child.\"</p><p>This statement is as true now as it was a century ago.</p><p>As one of the first countries to sign the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Canada has made a promise to children 'to protect and keep them safe'.</p><p>This is a promise that must not be broken.

But Friday's indictment represents the first charges in direct connection with election interference.</p><p>Mueller charged the defendants with one count of conspiracy to defraud the U.S., one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, and six counts of aggravated identity theft.</p><p>The special counsel also released a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/1035542/download\">plea deal</a> on Friday with Richard Pinedo, who <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/california-man-pleads-guilty-identity-fraud-mueller-probe-193652230--finance.html\" target=\"_blank\">admitted</a> to knowingly using other people's identification in connection with \"unlawful activity.\" He was paid at least US$1,000 for those activities during a one-year period, according to an unsealed court filing.</p><p>Russia's effort to interfere with the U.S. political system dates back to at least 2014, according to the indictment. By September 2016, just before the presidential election, the monthly budget for election interference operations was more than US$1.25 million.</p><p>The defendants posed as Americans to create social media pages, purchase political advertisements and stage political rallies, the indictment alleges. In some cases, the defendants stole the identities of real Americans to carry out these activities. Posing as Americans, some of the defendants \"communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities,\" the indictment said.</p><p><img alt=\"Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announces the indictments of more than a dozen Russians charged with conspiring to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election campaign during a news conference in Washington, D.C., Feb. 16, 2018. \" data-caption=\"Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announces the indictments of more than a dozen Russians charged with conspiring to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election campaign during a news conference in Washington, D.C., Feb. 16, 2018. \" data-credit=\"David Shepardson/Reuters\" data-mep=\"2461153\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=2200%2C1554%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=630%2C445&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F2770c8bf65669749825aa60afa5a1b3e%2F206134986%2FRTX4XBWG.jpeg&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=3c72cc66bd56effc71ecb2f018029e10fba7295e\" /></p><p>Some of the people listed in the indictment traveled to the U.S. \"under false pretenses for the purpose of collecting intelligence to inform Defendants' operations\" and to purchase computer infrastructure that would obscure the Russian origin of their online activities, according to the indictment.

That essentially means that DOJ isn't taking a position on whether the Russian activity swung the election.

We cannot allow those seeking to sow confusion, discord, and rancor to be successful,\" Trump said via a statement Friday. \"It's time we stop the outlandish partisan attacks, wild and false allegations, and far-fetched theories, which only serve to further the agendas of bad actors, like Russia, and do nothing to protect the principles of our institutions. We must unite as Americans to protect the integrity of our democracy and our elections.\"</p><h4>Contact With Trump Campaign</h4><p>In August of 2016, the indictment alleges, a person who identified themselves as the chair of the Trump campaign for a Florida county communicated with the Russians, who were pretending to be Americans. The person allegedly discussed logistics and locations for rallies.</p><p>The indictment alleges three instances in which the Russians, posing as Americans, contacted Trump campaign officials in Florida responsible for coordinating logistics in the state. In two instances, the Russians allegedly obtained the contact information for Trump campaign officials from someone with access to the \"Florida for Trump\" Facebook page. The Russians allegedly used a fake Gmail address to contact two of the campaign officials. The Russians allegedly contacted the third official using a fake Facebook account with the name \"Matt Skiber.\"</p><p>The indictment does not say whether the Trump campaign officials ever wrote back. The campaign officials and volunteers who the Russians communicated with, according to the indictment, were \"unwitting.\"</p><p>The Russians also allegedly used the Twitter account @March_for_Trump to contact a volunteer with the campaign in New York and got the volunteer to provide signs for a rally in support of Trump.</p><h4>The Troll Farm</h4><p>According to the indictment, the Internet Research Agency employed individuals to work throughout the night so that they could post during times that would make sense in U.S. time zones. The organization circulated a list of U.S. holidays so that employees could tailor their social media content and instructed them to write about U.S. foreign policy and economic issues. The goal was to create \"political intensity through supporting radical groups, users dissatisfied with [the] social and economic situation and oppositional social movements,\" the indictment alleged.</p><p>By 2016, some of the IRA-controlled groups and accounts had hundreds or thousands of online followers. Trump personally <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/910331061409902592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthinkprogress.org%2Ftrump-retweet-a-fake-twitter-account-149f3f9c1360%2F\">thanked</a> one of the more popular Russian-operated Twitter accounts, @TEN_GOP. On several occasions, Donald Trump Jr. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Zeddary/status/964562156044906496\">retweeted</a> the account, which attracted more than 100,000 followers.</p><p>Around 2015, the defendants began purchasing ads on social media sites to promote their efforts, spending several thousand dollars a month, according to the indictment. The Russian-run ads were expressly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton, the indictment alleges.</p><p>The Russians purchased computer servers located inside the U.S. to set up virtual private networks (VPNs) to hide their Russian identities, according to the indictment. They also allegedly \"registered and controlled hundreds of web-based email accounts hosted by U.S. email providers under false names so as to appear to be U.S. persons and groups.\"</p><h4>Posing As Americans</h4><p>Around 2016, the Russian defendants used the social security numbers and dates of birth of American citizens to open PayPal accounts, create fake driver's licenses and post on social media posing as those Americans. They also used their assumed identities to purchase political ads. Some of those ads were paid for with credit cards registered under the names of fictitious Americans. The defendants allegedly failed to report their expenditures to the Federal Election Commission or register as foreign agents with the Justice Department.</p><p>The advertisements contained inflammatory language that was pro-Trump and critical of Clinton. They say things like \"Hillary Clinton doesn't deserve the black vote,\" \"Donald wants to defeat terrorism...Hillary wants to sponsor it,\" \"Hillary Clinton has already committed voter fraud during the Democrat Iowa caucus\" and \"Hillary is a Satan, and her crimes and lies had proved just how evil she is.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4380493-Internet-Research-Agency-Indictment.html#document/p20/a404931\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"View the note 'Russian political ads' in its original document context on DocumentCloud in a new window or tab\">RUSSIAN POLITICAL ADS (p. 20)</a><a href=\"http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4380493-Internet-Research-Agency-Indictment.html#document/p20/a404931\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"View the note 'Russian political ads' in its original document context on DocumentCloud in a new window or tab\"><img height=\"584\" src=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4380493/pages/Internet-Research-Agency-Indictment-p20-normal.gif\" style=\"border:0px !important;height:auto;max-height:none !important;width:700px;\" width=\"599\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4380493-Internet-Research-Agency-Indictment.html#document/p20/a404931\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"View the note 'Russian political ads' in its original document context on DocumentCloud in a new window or tab\">View the entire document with DocumentCloud</a></p><p>The Russians also allegedly used social media to try and encourage minority groups not to participate in the election. The indictment claims they used an Instagram account called \"Woke Blacks\" to say African-Americans would be better off not voting in the 2016 election. They also allegedly used another Instagram account called \"Blactivist\" to encourage voting for Jill Stein as well as \"United Muslims of America\" social media accounts to encourage Muslims to boycott the election.</p><p>By posing as U.S. citizens, some of the defendants were able to gain information about where to focus their operations. During one exchange with a real American affiliated with a Texas-based grassroots group, some of the defendants learned they should focus on states like Colorado, Virginia, and Florida, according to the indictment.</p><p>After the election, they continued to coordinate rallies, both in support of Trump and also events protesting the results of the election.</p><h4>Cover-up</h4><p>The indictment alleges that the Russians tried to impede the investigation by deleting and destroying data, including emails and social media accounts. After Facebook disclosed that it was cooperating with the U.S. government in September 2017, the conspirators allegedly tried to cover up their activity. One of the defendants wrote an email to a family member indicating their involvement in the scheme and their attempts to cover their tracks.</p><p>\"We had a slight crisis here at work: the FBI busted our activity (not a joke). So, I got preoccupied with covering tracks together with the colleagues,\" she allegedly wrote. \"I created all these pictures and posts, and the Americans believed that it was written by their people.\"</p></div><section class=\"extra-content\"><p><a href=\"http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4380493-Internet-Research-Agency-Indictment.html#document/p1\" target=\"_blank\"><b><strong>Read the full indictment here.</strong></b></a></p><section><h5></h5></section><div class=\"extra-content__media\"></div></section>]]></description><link>http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/02/16/russian-nationals-election-meddling_a_23363746/</link><source_id>0SfWab</source_id><guid isPermalink=\"false\">23363746</guid><dc:creator>Ryan J.

Here are a few, and how you can avoid them.</p><p><strong>Outdated thinking about career security</strong></p><p>While there is much you can do to protect and maximize your own career-ability, times have changed and old notions of job security need an overhaul. Today, you need to think in terms of \"gig' (even if you have a full-time job) and constantly stay on your \"career/change-ready toes.\"</p><p><strong>Complacency</strong></p><p>If you've been coasting for too long now, two words for you: wake up! Career complacency is bad for your health, professionally and personally. Stagnation puts your career at risk.</p><p>You need not have aspirations for a huge vertical career trajectory, but it's always a good idea to develop yourself in some way, shape or form. Get a goal; learn a new skill or three; connect and get out there. Do some or all of this and you'll be safer, happier and healthier too.</p><p><strong>Risk aversion</strong></p><p>A good measure of prudence can be wise, but not too much. Insisting on certainty at the expense of taking some healthy risks can derail your career over the longer haul. Over-investing in the illusion of safety can actually can hold you back from taking stretch assignments and new opportunities to grow and build upon your career experience.</p><p>Nothing is guaranteed and indeed sometimes a decision may not work out for the better. But this need not derail your entire career.</p><p><strong>Networking blues</strong></p><p>I talk to a lot of people who have an aversion to networking. Sound like you? If it feels \"icky,\" chances are you may not have learned how to connect authentically, purposefully and reciprocally.</p><p>Avoid networking at your own peril. Get more comfortable by learning how to connect authentically, and since this is a skill for life make it high priority and not just for when you need a job. Successful careerists know healthy networking is a year-round, career-long necessity.</p><p><strong>Blind to your own super powers and accomplishments</strong></p><p>Most people are so busy getting stuff they lose sight of the miracles they perform every day in large and small part. They fail to recognize their own strengths, abilities and talents. As a result, when it comes time to speak to their worth and value, they sometimes sell themselves short &mdash; even to themselves.</p><p>Some people are simply modest, but when it comes to careers it can be at their detriment and they need to <a href=\"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/blogs/insight/canadians-need-to-get-better-at-boasting-about-193045842.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">get better at conveying their value</a>. You need to be your own brand marketing officer! Make this the year you learn and/or rediscover your unique strengths, abilities, success stories and how to convey all this with confidence without feeling like a braggart.</p><p><strong>Stuck in limiting beliefs of shame </strong></p><p>Sometimes people feel embarrassed about being laid off and/or not yet having landed a new job. This feeling of shame holds them back from reaching out (network, recruiters, etc.) and leaning into their job search.</p><p>Stop that train of thought! This is a self-limiting belief that does nothing good. Lay-offs happen. Companies change. And even if you were let go because of poor fit, so what? It happens to many incredibly successful people. Move on. Your self-limiting thoughts can become your biggest obstacle. </p><p><strong>Procrastination</strong></p><p>You know better, and yet, you're still not taking action. There are lots of reasons why people procrastinate when they want or need to make a career change: they are overwhelmed; uncertain how to navigate the way forward; feel daunted; lack confidence, and more.</p><p>Staying still and doing nothing will only dig you deeper into the hole of self-doubt and inertia. The most important steps to take are the first ones, and tiny ones work just fine.<strong></strong></p>]]></description><link>http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/eileenchadnick/7-career-limiting-mistakes-you-want-to-avoid_a_23360551/</link><source_id>0SfWab</source_id><guid isPermalink=\"false\">23360551</guid><dc:creator>Eileen Chadnick</dc:creator><dc:publisher>AMP: HuffPost Canada</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Other</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 18:04:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1518804439270624000</ingested><modified>2018-02-16T18:06:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[LIVING]]></category><category><![CDATA[living]]></category><media:content url=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/a339084d9f3f628687ee7d9841367d62/206019431/female-designers-fist-bumping-in-conference-room-meeting-picture-id697540525\" width=\"\" height=\"\" medium=\"image\"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Getty Images/Hero Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[BTS Wants Fans To Know It\u2019s OK To Talk About Mental Health]]></title><description type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>When Kim Jong-hyun, of the pop group SHINee, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/12/19/jonghyun-shinee-death_a_23312048/\" target=\"_blank\">died suddenly in December</a>, the K-pop community was devastated &mdash; including fellow band BTS.

Women]]></title><description type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>In early February, B.C.'s former Premier Christy Clark <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/turning-metoo-into-a-tangible-shift-for-female-leaders/article37833211/\" rel=\"nofollow\">published an op-ed</a> titled \"Turning #MeToo into a tangible shift for female leaders\" in the<em> Globe and Mail. </em>In this piece, Clark argues that the appropriate political response to the #MeToo movement is to ensure more women are hired into positions of power in government.</p><p><img alt=\"Now-former British Columbia Premier Christy Clark walks from her office to attend a confidence vote in Victoria, B.C., on June 29, 2017.\"

/></p><p>Clark lays out the ways in which she broke the political glass ceiling, and used her power to elevate women in her field: Her party's Speaker was a woman, her caucus chair was a woman and the lieutenant-governor was a woman. More than a third of Clark's government board appointees were women, and she hired B.C.'s first two female attorney generals. At first glance, it sounds like Christy Clark is dedicated to supporting women.</p><p>But a closer look proves otherwise: Christy Clark not only neglected to support women while in power, she also made things worse for them.</p><p>Christy Clark came to power in 2011, taking over the leadership of the B.C. Liberal Party from Gordon Campbell. While Campbell was premier, <a href=\"http://rabble.ca/news/campbells-cruel-cuts-end-era-bc-women\" rel=\"nofollow\">he cut 100 per cent of the $1.7 million that was allotted to B.C.'s women-serving organizations</a>. That funding works out to one dollar per year, per woman, in B.C. It seems that a dollar year was too steep an investment for Campbell's B.C. Liberals.</p><blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote\">You know who didn't step up fill this gap? Christy Clark.</span></blockquote><p>These cuts meant that B.C.'s women-serving organizations lost an average of $48,000 of core funding each. Core funding pays for rent, electricity and other operational costs. These cuts led to the closure of over half of the province's women-serving organizations. These organizations offered a range of services the government was not providing: emergency shelters, crisis counselling, referral services and spaces for community gathering.</p><p>For WAVAW Rape Crisis Centre, a lack of core funding meant we had less money available to hire client-serving staff. This led to what is now an 18-month wait list for counselling services. This is like having a critical injury and then waiting 18 months for the ambulance to arrive.</p><p>But WAVAW is also relatively lucky. We are one of the few organizations that survived these funding cuts. This was thanks to the incredible generosity of our community, who stepped up to donate and fill the gap left by Campbell's government.</p><p><img data-credit=\"baona via Getty Images\" data-mep=\"2460399\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=6480%2C4580%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=630%2C445&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F39c5c7c3eb957ec811a251cd699bdc9a%2F206133514%2Fpensive-mother-and-son-looking-out-of-window-picture-id696326358&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=8c85b68cce4e4dca58f18005bb8e75a9b8de58bd\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>You know who didn't step up fill this gap? Christy Clark.</p><p><a href=\"https://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2017/05/01/Clark-Government-Sexist-Policies/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Instead of using her power as a politician to advocate for the health, wealth and safety of all women, Clark doubled down on Campbell's oppressive actions.</a></p><p>Clark's childcare subsidies only reached four per cent of Canadian children and weren't increased in over a decade, meaning thousands of B.C. moms had to sacrifice full-time work to stay home and care for their children. B.C.'s child poverty rate was the highest in all of Canada under Clark's watch.</p><p>Clark's lack of funding for disabled folks led to further isolation and alienation for this already marginalized community. Her party cut family law and poverty law services, depriving women of access to economic independence and freedom from violence. Clark's B.C. Liberals spent a decade avoiding spending billions of dollars needed to hire more teachers and improve children's education.</p><blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote\">This is not feminism. This is neoliberalism with a pink bow on it.</span></blockquote><p>WAVAW Rape Crisis Centre agrees with Christy Clark that women need to be hired into positions of power. However, this is only a small fraction of the conversation that needs to be had about gender equality. Which women are able to access these positions of power? Which women aren't? What are women doing with the power they have once they get it? And who is left out of this conversation completely? How are we elevating our trans, two spirit and non-binary community? How are we making sure to address Canada's colonial past and its effects on Indigenous communities?</p><p>Christy Clark's idea of a \"tangible shift\" in the wake of #MeToo only supports wealthy, white, educated, straight, cisgender and able-bodied women.</p><p>This is not feminism. This is neoliberalism with a pink bow on it.</p><blockquote><h2><strong>More blogs from HuffPost Canada:</strong></h2><br /><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/christy-clark/heres-how-you-change-the-often-brutally-sexist-business-of-politics_a_23345465?utm_campaign=canada_dau\" target=\"_hplink\">Here's How You Change 'Brutally Sexist' Business Of Politics: Ex-Premier</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/lizanne-foster/christy-clark-bc-election_b_16469784.html?utm_campaign=canada_dau\" target=\"_hplink\">Christy Clark Win Would Go Against Everything I Teach My Students</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/sarah-miller2/christy-clark-i-am-linda_b_16335940.html?utm_campaign=canada_dau\" target=\"_hplink\">We Are All Linda, The B.C.

NDP do nothing to overturn these oppressive policies, they will only be continuing the legacy of the B.C. Liberals.</p><p>We believe our provincial government can do more and better for women, trans, two spirit and non-binary folks. We're calling on the provincial government to provide core funding to all social service organizations in B.C., because, as Audre Lorde said, no woman is free until all women are
