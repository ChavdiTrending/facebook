Merkel\u2019s party, the Christian Democratic Union, and its Bavarian partner, the Christian Social Union, secured 33 percent of the votes\u2014their worst electoral result since 1949. The CSU-CDU alliance lost 65 seats compared to its 2013 election victory, though they remain the largest force in the German parliament, Bundestag.</p>\n<p>In order to secure a majority, Merkel\u2019s alliance must form a coalition government, but negotiations among the country\u2019s political parties have resulted in a four-month long deadlock, which is still ongoing. The Social Democrats Party, or SPD, which obtained 21 percent votes and <a href=\"https://www.bundestag.de/en/parliament/plenary/distributionofseats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">153 seats</span></a> to become the second-largest party in last year\u2019s elections, also saw its worst electoral performance. Though Martin Schulz, the head of the SPD, had initially ruled out the possibility of a repeat of the incumbent \u201cgrand coalition\u201d with the CDU, the parties started fresh negotiations after tripartite talks between the CDU-CSU alliance, the Free Democrats Party and the left-leaning Green Party <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/german-coalition-talks-collapse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">collapsed in mid November</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Schulz and Merkel recently concluded negotiations to form government, in which Merkel had to make <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics/merkels-conservatives-make-big-concessions-to-spd-in-coalition-deal-idUSKBN1FR0HS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">significant concessions</a></span>, including awarding the finance ministry to the SPD. But the coalition has yet to be approved by a membership vote of the SPD, in which around 464,000 members of the party will vote on the alliance with Merkel. According to a Reuters report, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics-schulz-nahles/german-spds-schulz-optimistic-membership-will-back-coalition-idUSKBN1FR2QG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Schulz stated</a></span> that he was optimistic about the vote, the results of which will be announced on 4 March. He also stated that, for the SPD, the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics/merkels-conservatives-make-big-concessions-to-spd-in-coalition-deal-idUSKBN1FR0HS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">coalition deal marked</a></span> a \u201cfundamental change in the direction of Europe.\u201d But the September elections reflected a fundamental shift in German politics for another reason as well\u2014the Alternative for Germany, or AfD, won 13 percent of the votes and 92 seats, and became the first far-right party to enter the Bundestag since the Second World War.</p>\n<p>The AfD is not only dominating the national discourse but also forcing mainstream parties to re-strategise their politics. One of the central issues that had caused the tripartite coalition talks to fail, among others such as tax policies and environmental concerns, was the CSU\u2019s stance on immigration. While the CSU had always been more conservative than the CDU, the party <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://thewire.in/209839/merkels-allies-defying-spd-seek-cuts-tax-asylum-seeker-benefits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">doubled down on its hard line position</a></span> after the results, and demanded cuts to welfare benefits for asylum seekers. This campaign season also witnessed a resurgence of rhetoric and vocabulary that was popular during the Nazi era. The election indicated the dangers of the far-right politics and the challenges it is posing for the mainstream parties.</p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of people are just angry and feel they are not well taken care of,\u201d Sylvia Schwarz, a Berlin-based actor, told me. \u201cMost of them are actually not right-wing in their spirit.\u201d Schwarz\u2019s expression is a common sentiment among a section of Germans, who still believe in an inclusive and multicultural Germany. According to Fabian von der Mark, a political correspondent with Germany\u2019s public international broadcaster Deutsche Welle, several analysts had misdiagnosed the populist surge as one arising from an economic insecurity, rather than a \u201cdifference in values.\u201d Fabian added that it was the responsibility of the progressive forces to engage with people and address this values gap.</p>\n<p>In the last few decades, as centre-left parties clinched the middle-class liberal consensus, a coalition of working-class voters and social conservatives felt marginalised and automatically defected to the populist right. According to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2017-09/german-election-alternative-for-germany-angela-merkel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">a September 2017 article published on the web portal of <em>Zeit</em></a></span>, a weekly German newspaper, over one million voters who traditionally voted for the CDU-CSU alliance had supported the right-wing populists in last year\u2019s elections.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it is a failure on the part of CDU and SPD that they have not been able to convince people that the migration is in Germany\u2019s interest,\u201d Antje Stiebitzh, a senior German journalist, told me. \u201cThe right-wing parties have smartly capitalised on this misunderstanding.\u201d The AfD also reportedly gained the support of 1.4 million former non-voters who came out to vote for the first time in these elections\u2014perhaps a reflection of Stiebitzh\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p>While Merkel\u2019s election to a fourth term may appear to suggest that the German electorate chose freedom over fear, inclusion over exclusion and larger humanism over narrow racism, that may not be entirely accurate. Upon scratching the surface a little, it becomes evident that in addition to the right-wing arguments against immigration, traditional Nazi jargon is also making inroads into the psyche of the German people. The terminology is being used to define what constitutes a real German and Germany, and to vilify and demonise the rest.</p>\n<p>For instance, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, an AfD party leader, has used the term <em>Volk</em>, or \u201cThe Nation,\u201d to define an authentic German national. \u201cOur dear Volk is deeply divided,\u201d H\u00f6cke said. \u201cThe decline in our birth-rate and mass immigration into Germany has for the first time fundamentally threatened our existence.\u201dThe phrase was commonly used in Nazi Germany to segregate those who could live in Germany and the others who were not entitled to be a part of the <em>Volk</em>.</p>\n<p>Another AfD politician, Dirk Driesang, used the term <em>ueberfremdund</em>, which roughly translates to\u201cover-foreignisation\u201d or an excess of foreigners or immigrants on German land, while arguring against the influx of migrants. The word is a direct import from the Nazi vocabulary\u2014Joseph Goebbels, the minister of propaganda in Adolf Hitler\u2019s regime, used the term to define Jews and their \u201charmful\u201d influence on German national culture. By popularising the term, Goebbels and Hitler created a public perception that the Jewish community did not deserve a place in the German society.</p>\n<p><em>Volksverraeterin</em>, which translates to \u201ctraitor\u201d and was often used to describe someone who is supposed to have betrayed the nation, is another word that has seen resurgence in modern-day Germany. During the election campaign, supporters of right-wing parties, such as the AfD, had <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://daserste.ndr.de/panorama/archiv/2017/Poebler-gegen-Merkel-Hau-ab-Du-Volksverraeterin-,merkel2678.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">used the term</a></span> to describe Merkel and her party. The implication was that Merkel had compromised on German values through her open-door immigration policies, by allowing people who did not belong to the German state into the country.</p>\n<p>It is not only the far-right that is invoking this rhetoric. In the run up to the federal elections, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, the interior minister and member of the CDU, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.dw.com/en/german-interior-minister-speaks-out-in-favor-of-leitkultur-for-immigrants/a-38643836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">charted a 10-point plan on what constitutes <em>leitkultur</em></a></span>, referring to the idea of establishing a leading or guiding German culture that should prevail over everything else. Maizi\u00e8re claimed that it would be inclusive because people who were secure about the German guiding culture would be more tolerant towards others. But his definition of <em>leitkultur </em>also stood in contrast to the values of diversity and multiculturalism of the German society.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are an open society,\u201d Maizi\u00e8re noted in his plan. \u201cWe show our face and shake our hands. We do not believe in <em>burka</em>.\u201d The anti-Muslim sentiment in Maizi\u00e8re\u2019s definition of what should constitute Germany\u2019s guiding culture is transparent. This has been the impact of the anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim narrative created by the right wing\u2014rather than provide an alternative and inclusive narrative, the official policy of Merkel\u2019s CDU seemed to echo that of the far-right.</p>\n<p>This discourse about a German culture and identity was primarily aimed at two demographics. The approximately four million second- and third-generation Muslim Germans, mostly of Turkish ethnic origin, who came to Germany between 1950-60 and subsequently acquired German citizenship. The second category of people it was directed towards was the approximately one million immigrants who entered the country during the refugee crisis\u2014the influx of immigrants during 2015\u201317, many of them Muslim, who entered Europe from west Asia and Africa.</p>\n<p>The German constitution confers the right of political asylum as a basic human right. In accordance with the same, Angela Merkel adopted an open-door policy for refugees in 2015\u2014that year, Germany accepted around 890,000 asylum applications. But Merkel soon recognised the social undercurrent in certain sections of German society of an opposition to her pro-immigrant policies. As a result, in 2016, Merkel steered talks between Turkey and the European Union, which <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/03/the-eu-turkey-deal-europes-year-of-shame/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">led to an agreement</a></span> in March that year, to limit the number of refugees entering EU countries through Turkey. In return, the EU member states would increase their efforts towards the resettlement of Syrian refugees in Turkey, visa liberalisation for Turkish nationals, and provide additional financial support for the country\u2019s refugee population.</p>\n<p>During the humanitarian crisis between 2015\u201317, Merkel appeared to be a global peace-maker, but it was after compromising her ideological position of a diverse and all-inclusive Germany that did not discriminate on the basis of religion or ethnicity. Irrespective of who won the elections, the debate over Germany\u2019s plurality has already been won by right-wing politics.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\"

According to Sharma, the documents show signs of possible trauma to the brain, and even possible poisoning.</p>\n<p>Sharma spoke to <em>The Caravan</em> after studying Loya\u2019s post-mortem report and related histopathology report, a report that accompanied samples of Loya\u2019s viscera that were sent for chemical analysis, and the results of the chemical analysis. Some of these documents have been procured through Right to Information applications, and others have been <a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/loya-supreme-court-documents-raise-more-questions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">submitted to the Supreme Court</span> </a>by the government of Maharashtra in support of a report by Maharashtra\u2019s State Intelligence Department that concludes there is no cause for suspicion regarding Loya\u2019s death. Sharma\u2019s expert opinion contradicts this conclusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is no evidence of myocardial infarction in the histopathology report,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cThe findings in this report have no suggestion of a heart-attack. They show changes, but not a heart attack.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sharma observed, \u201cThe post-mortem report also says that calcification is observed in the vessels. Where there is calcification, there is no heart attack. Once the vessels have calcified they will never block the flow of blood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Loya is reported to have complained of feeling unwell at about 4 am on the night of his death, and was declared dead at 6.15 am. \u201cSo that means two hours,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cIf one is alive for more than 30 minutes after the symptoms [of a heart attack] show, the condition of the heart will have clear changes. No clear changes can be seen here.\u201d</p>\n<p>The post-mortem report states that the probable cause of death was \u201ccoronary artery insufficiency.\u201d Sharma said that \u201cthere are changes observed in heart in these documents, but none of them are conclusive enough to show \u2018Coronary Artery Insufficiency.\u2019 Every patient who goes for a bypass surgery will have these symptoms.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMore importantly, dura is congested according to the post-mortem report,\u201d Sharma added. \u201cDura mater is the outermost layer that surrounds our brain. It is damaged in cases of trauma, which indicates some kind of an assault on the brain. A physical assault.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr Anuradha Biyani, Loya\u2019s sister and a medical doctor in the service of the Maharashtra government, told <em>The Caravan</em> earlier that, when she saw her brother\u2019s body for the first time after his death, \u201cthere were bloodstains on the neck at the back of the shirt.\u201d Biyani maintains a diary, and in an entry from the time of Loya\u2019s death she recorded that \u201cthere was blood on his collar.\u201d Sarita Mandhane, another of Loya\u2019s sisters, had also mentioned \u201cblood on the neck\u201d when she spoke to <em>The Caravan</em>, and that \u201cthese was blood and an injury on his head \u2026 on the back side.\u201d Harkishan Loya, the judge\u2019s father, told <em>The Caravan</em> that he remembered \u201cbloodstains on the clothes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Among the state of Maharashtra\u2019s submission to the Supreme Court is a bill in Loya\u2019s name from Nagpur\u2019s Meditrina hospital, where the judge was declared dead. While Meditrina officials maintain that Loya was brought in with heart problems, this document inexplicably lists \u201cneurosurgery\u201d as a billed item.</p>\n<p>The post-mortem report does not record precisely how much congestion of dura was observed. Sharma said he found it strange that \u201cthe reason why dura is congested is not written.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is a possibility of poisoning,\u201d Sharma continued, looking at the post-mortem report. \u201cEvery single organ is congested.\u201d The organs recorded as \u201ccongested\u201d in the report include the liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, oesophagus and lungs, among others.</p>\n<p>The findings of the chemical analysis on Loya\u2019s viscera samples, submitted 50 days after the judge\u2019s death, did not identify any poison. The analysis was performed at the Regional Forensic Science Laboratory in Nagpur. It is recorded as having started on 5 January 2015\u201436 days after Loya\u2019s death, on the night intervening between 30 November and 1 December 2014\u2014and finished 14 days later, on 19 January 2015. \u201cWhy did it take so long for the analysis,\u201d Sharma asked. \u201cIt generally takes a day or two [to complete the analysis].\u201d</p>\n<p>The chain of custody of Loya\u2019s viscera sample appears to have been broken in the aftermath of the post-mortem. According to documents submitted to the Supreme Court by the state of Maharashtra, a zero-FIR regarding Loya\u2019s death was first registered at Nagpur\u2019s Sitabuldi police station. The Sitabuldi station arranged for the post-mortem, conducted at the Government Medical College in Nagpur from 10.55 am to 11.50 am on 1 December. The samples for chemical analysis are collected at the same time. For reasons that have not yet been made clear, the FIR was then transferred to Nagpur\u2019s Sadar police station, where records show that it was registered at 4pm. It was the Sadar station that dispatched Loya\u2019s tissue samples for analysis with the necessary letter. It is not clear where, and with whom, Loya\u2019s tissue samples were in the hours between the post-mortem and the registration of the FIR at the Sadar station, or under whose supervision they were handed over to the Sadar station. Nor has it been made clear why the Sitabuldi station did not send the samples to the forensic laboratory right after the post-mortem was done.</p>\n<p>In addition, there is no consensus on the condition of Loya\u2019s body and the probable cause of Loya\u2019s death as recorded in the post-mortem report and the report that accompanied Loya\u2019s viscera samples when these were sent for analysis\u2014despite the fact that the latter is meant to be based entirely on the former. In a field titled \u201crigor mortis,\u201d meant to record how stiff a body is at the time of inspection, the post-mortem report states, \u201cslightly present in upper limbs [and] not appeared in lower limbs.\u201d The viscera report, under the same field, says that rigor mortis is \u201cwell marked.\u201d Rigor mortis could not have been \u201cslightly present\u201d and \u201cwell marked\u201d at the same time. In a field titled \u201copinion as to the probable cause of death,\u201d the post-mortem report states, \u201cCoronary artery insufficiency.\u201d Under the same field, the viscera report and notes, \u201cA case of sudden death.\u201d In a field titled \u201cStory of case,\u201d the viscera report states, \u201cA case of natural death,\u201d with the words \u201cnatural death\u201d underlined\u2014and yet a report of accidental death had earlier been registered at the Sitabuldi police station before it sent Loya\u2019s body for a post-mortem.</p>\n<p>Both the post-mortem report and the viscera report were prepared at the Government Medical College in Nagpur. The form used for the viscera report, obtained via a Right to Information application, clearly states that the information in it must be based on the post-mortem, and must be prepared immediately after the post-mortem by the same doctor who conducted the procedure. The form in Loya\u2019s case, filled in by the forensic department of the Government Medical College, is titled \u201cForm in which Report of Post-mortem Examination to be used when forwarding Viscera to the Chemical Analyser.\u201d A doctor who works in the forensic department at AIIMS in Delhi confirmed that the standard procedure is to \u201ccopy the information in the post-mortem to the form\u201d that accompanies viscera sent to a chemical analyser. Sharma said the same thing.</p>\n<p>In Loya\u2019s case, both the post-mortem and the viscera reports are signed by Dr NK Tumaram, a lecturer at the Government Medical College\u2014and yet the same doctor, in reports meant to be prepared almost simultaneously, has furnished clearly contradictory information, even on something as important as the probable cause of death. When <em>The Caravan</em> contacted Tumaram, he said he could not speak about the case since it is being heard in court.</p>\n<p>Loya was 48 years old at the time of his death, did not smoke or drink, and had no personal or familial history of heart ailments. \u201cOur parents are 85 and 80 years old, and are healthy with no cardiac history,\u201d Anuradha Biyani <a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/shocking-details-emerge-in-death-of-judge-presiding-over-sohrabuddin-trial-family-breaks-silence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">earlier told <em>The Caravan</em></span></a>. Loya, she added, \u201cwas always a teetotaller, played table tennis for two hours a day for years, had no diabetes or blood pressure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr RK Sharma has written five books on forensic and medico-legal issues, and has lectured and trained judges and public prosecutors on multiple occasions. He has been a consultant for the Central Bureau of Investigation, been invited to international seminars by investigative agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the United States, and has organised numerous national and international seminars in forensic medicine and toxicology.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Isme</em> investigation <em>hona chahiye</em>\u201d (There should be an investigation in this), Sharma said while reading the documents. He later reiterated, \u201cThe situation presented in these documents necessitates an investigation.\u201d</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_35343\" style=\"max-width: 1605px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/death-judge-loya-medical-documents-rule-heart-attack-forensic-expert/attachment/cause-of-death_vantage_the-caravan-magazine_11-february-2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"wp-image-35343 size-full\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Cause-of-death_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_11-February-2018.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1605\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Cause-of-death_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_11-February-2018.jpg 1605w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Cause-of-death_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_11-February-2018-300x187.jpg 300w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Cause-of-death_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_11-February-2018-698x435.jpg 698w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1605px) 100vw, 1605px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sheet of post-mortem report (left) and sheet of viscera report (right) showing contradictory opinions on probable cause of death.</figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_35344\" style=\"max-width: 1636px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/death-judge-loya-medical-documents-rule-heart-attack-forensic-expert/attachment/congestion_vantage_the-caravan-magazine_11-february-2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"wp-image-35344 size-full\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Congestion_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_11-February-2018.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1636\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Congestion_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_11-February-2018.jpg 1636w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Congestion_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_11-February-2018-300x183.jpg 300w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Congestion_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_11-February-2018-700x428.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1636px) 100vw, 1636px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sheets of post-mortem report showing congestion of multiple organs, including the liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, oesophagus and lungs, among others.</figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_35345\" style=\"max-width: 2429px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/death-judge-loya-medical-documents-rule-heart-attack-forensic-expert/attachment/rigor-mortis_vantage_the-caravan-magazine_11-february-2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"wp-image-35345 size-full\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Rigor-Mortis_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_11-February-2018.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2429\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Rigor-Mortis_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_11-February-2018.jpg 2429w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Rigor-Mortis_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_11-February-2018-300x124.jpg 300w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Rigor-Mortis_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_11-February-2018-700x288.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2429px) 100vw, 2429px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Report of chemical analysis on tissue samples (left) showing date of start and end of analysis.

They lined up in the building\u2019s glass atrium, waiting to testify before the members of the state board of education. That day, the board was scheduled to vote on whether various new history and social-science textbooks were going to be adopted for use in California\u2019s government-run schools. The <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://edsource.org/2017/after-hours-of-testimony-state-board-rejects-two-history-textbooks-approves-10-others/590118\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">board president reportedly stated</a></span> that the hearing was \u201cthe longest in the history of the state Board of Education.\u201d</p>\n<p>A point of contention before the board that day was the material in these textbooks that referred to South Asia. Thenmozhi Soundararajan, an anti-caste activist who testified that day, estimated that of the roughly 500 people present, 470 were there to discuss concerns related to this material. A key concern\u2014among others, such as the description of the Indus Valley Civilisation and the origins of Sikhism\u2014was the representation of caste in Hinduism.</p>\n<p>The people present, and their concerns, can be divided into two broad camps. One camp was led by <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.southasianhistoriesforall.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">South Asian Histories for All</a></span>, an inter-caste, multi-faith group of activists that Soundararajan founded. SAHFA cited inaccuracies regarding caste and other issues in the textbook material, and called for a delay on the books\u2019 approval so that they could be submitted for further editing. The other camp, which Soundararajan said greatly outnumbered SAHFA, was led by the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://www.hafsite.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hindu American Foundation</a></span> (HAF), a non-profit that claims to advocate for Hindus in the United States, and the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://www.hindueducation.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hindu Education Foundation</a></span> (HEF)\u2014an outfit affiliated with the Hindu Swayamsewak Sangh, the US-based wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh. This camp, too, was heavily critical of certain parts of the textbooks, which they felt denigrated Hinduism. They did not, however, ask for the board\u2019s decision to be delayed.</p>\n<p>After the public hearing, the board voted to reject two of the 12 textbooks up for discussion, both published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. The camp led by the HAF and HEF, which claimed to represent the Hindus in the US, had criticised the textbooks for content that was deemed derogatory to Hinduism, including a flippant question that was criticised as mocking (\u201cHow\u2019s Your Karma Doing?\u201d), and a photograph of cows eating trash. The board approved the rest of the books, which had been released by other well-known publishers, among them National Geographic, Pearson and McGraw Hill.</p>\n<p>Even the textbooks that were approved, however, had at least some material that Hindu groups had called derogatory. Nevertheless, the Hindu camp celebrated the board\u2019s decision as a victory. HAF and HEF <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://www.hafsite.org/hindu-americans-win-historic-victory-california-textbooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">both</a></span> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://www.hindueducation.org/hindu-americans-win-historic-victory-in-california-textbooks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">posted</a></span> an identical statement on their respective websites, titled \u201cHindu Americans Win Historic Victory in California Textbooks.\u201d SAHFA, meanwhile, posted a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.southasianhistoriesforall.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">press release</a></span> titled \u201cHistory Under Attack: New California Textbooks Fail to Protect Targeted Minorities, Cave to Hindu Nationalists.\u201d</p>\n<p>SAHFA criticised the textbooks for not complying with a set of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/hs/cf/sbedrafthssfw.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">curricular guidelines</a></span>\u2014called the \u201cframework\u201d\u2014that the California board of education had finalised in May 2016. The framework was determined after many months of edits submitted by members of the public, and a review process facilitated by a team of educational experts called the Instructional Quality Commission, or IQC. According to state procedure, the framework dictates the content that should appear in textbooks.</p>\n<p>The finalising of the framework, too, saw a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/california-history-denial-caste-indian-american-community\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tussle involving largely the same players</a></span>: HEF and HAF on the Hindu side, and SAHFA and many leading South Asianist academics in opposition to them. In the final framework, SAHFA\u2019s camp had come out ahead. Almost all of the edits that came from the Hindu side\u2014many of which sought to erase or whitewash more unsavoury aspects of Hinduism and South Asian history, such as patriarchy and caste\u2014were rejected. Several of SAHFA\u2019s edits, including ones that affirmed the existence of caste oppression, were accepted. SAHFA\u2019s assumption at the time, Soundararajan said, was \u201cthat our job was done.\u201d But in early 2017, when she saw the textbooks, \u201cit was just like night and day from what was approved in the framework and what got implemented.\u201d</p>\n<p>The state board\u2019s decision in November marked a dramatic reversal of fortunes between the two camps, which, if the board had more diligently followed its procedure, would likely not have occurred. An examination of this procedure reveals the pressure that Hindu groups exerted on the publishers, such as directly participating in their review processes and embroiling them in litigation, to influence the final outcome. Soundararajan noted, \u201cOur assumption was that the State Board of Education was going to be protecting the adherence to the frameworks, and they were negligent in that.\u201d</p>\n<p>A clear example of the influence that the Hindu groups exerted over the publishers is that Murali Balaji, HAF\u2019s director of education, is credited in the National Geographic textbook as a \u201creviewer of religious content.\u201d During the debate on the framework, HAF had asked that the phrase \u201ccommunities outside the jati system, the \u2018Untouchables,\u2019\u201d be changed to \u201csocially ostracized and economically disadvantaged communities\u201d\u2014a revision that would have scrubbed the sentence of any reference to caste. The proposed change was officially rejected, and SAHFA\u2019s request to have the line edited to include the term \u201cDalit\u201d was incorporated into the final framework.</p>\n<p>But the final textbook matches HAF\u2019s suggested edits more closely than it does the framework text. For example, while the framework had described the Dalit community by name, the approved National Geographic textbook fails to do so. It notes, \u201cAt the bottom were slaves, laborers, and artisans \u2026 Many centuries later, another group developed that was considered even lower.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Hindu camp\u2019s edits, particularly on issues concerning the representation of caste, appeared to mirror the positions adopted by Hindutva groups in India. For instance, Sanskar Bharti, a cultural affiliate of the RSS, was <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/rss-outfit-wants-manusmriti-reworked-mahesh-sharma-culture-ministry-4654823/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">reportedly seeking</a></span> to \u201ccorrect the lies\u201d about ancient Hindu scriptures being \u201canti-Dalit and anti-woman.\u201d The outfit sought to remove references to caste discrimination from the Manusmriti, and noted that interpretations of the text arguing that it was anti-Dalit were \u201cpropaganda.\u201d The Hindu camp\u2019s edits during both the framework and textbook review sought a similar erasure of references to caste.</p>\n<p>A similar deviation from the framework was evident in National Geographic\u2019s discussion of Sikhism. The framework makes clear the fact that Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikhism, \u201cwas a social reformer who challenged the authority of the Brahmins and the caste order.\u201d The National Geographic textbook, however, does not include any mention of Nanak\u2019s opposition to the caste system.</p>\n<p>During the framework review, HAF, HEF and the Uberoi Foundation\u2014another Hindu group\u2014had all submitted edits for this line that would have erased its reference to caste. According to Jaideep Singh, an academic who specialises in the study of Sikhs in the United States and is active with SAHFA, Nanak\u2019s opposition to caste was \u201cvery central to Sikh identity.\u201d The Hindu groups, he added, \u201cviewed it as a personal attack on Hinduism, when in fact it\u2019s who we are as a people.\u201d</p>\n<p>National Geographic did not respond to questions about Balaji\u2019s involvement in the textbook-drafting process. When I asked Suhag Shukla, the executive director of HAF, about Balaji\u2019s role as a reviewer on the textbook, she told me that not only had HAF worked with National Geographic, but they have \u201cworked with most of the major ones\u201d\u2014publishers\u2014in California and in other states. \u201cCalifornia, being the largest purchaser of textbooks, is an important state, but these narratives are found in textbooks across the United States.\u201d Samir Kalra, a senior director of HAF, affirmed that the foundation had worked directly with all the publishers except for Studies Weekly and McGraw Hill.</p>\n<p>A similar influence seems to have been exercised over Pearson\u2019s textbooks. In several instances, the textbooks used the phrase \u201cIndus-Sarasvati Civilization\u201d instead of the term \u201cIndus Valley Civilization\u201d\u2014the phrase used in the framework, which holds the current academic consensus. \u201cSarasvati\u201d refers to a river from Hindu myth, whose historical existence has not been documented in reputed scholarship. California\u2019s framework contains no usages of the phrase \u201cIndus-Sarasvati Civilization.\u201d</p>\n<p>During the adoption process, the drafted textbooks undergo an initial review by a panel of experts, followed by a final review by the IQC, which takes the review panel\u2019s recommendations and the publishers\u2019 responses into consideration in its decision. In its report, the review panel flagged Pearson\u2019s mentions of the Sarasvati River and requested they be edited or removed. In one proposed edit, the report reads, \u201cThis is a subject of controversy, not settled fact. Correction: Remove mention of \u2018Sarasvati\u2019 and refer to it as \u2018Indus Valley Civilization.\u2019\u201d In another comment, the panel was even more emphatic: \u201cThe Sarasvati River has never been proven to exist.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pearson doubled down in the face of this criticism, and in doing so, revealed that they had received extensive input from Hindu groups on this matter. In a hearing held at the department of education in late September, where the review panel\u2019s suggestions were discussed, Luess Sampson-Lizotte\u2014the vice president for product development for humanities and science at Pearson\u2014requested that the panel\u2019s recommendations about the Sarasvati be rejected. Sampson-Lizotte said, \u201cWe worked closely with national and local Hindu scholars to ensure that we created the highest-quality program for California students. The requested changes are supported by the Hindu American Foundation, the Hindu Education Foundation, and Hindupedia.\u201d (Hindupedia is a website that also submitted detailed feedback to the textbooks. In one edit, they claimed that a description of the caste system was a \u201cvery stereotypical and negative remark, because these rigid customs were observed only in a few parts of India in late medieval times.\u201d)</p>\n<p>The IQC was unmoved by Pearson\u2019s appeal. In a report by the commission in October, they upheld all of the review panel\u2019s requests to have references to the \u201cIndus-Sarasvati Civilization\u201d removed or changed to the \u201cIndus Civilization.\u201d Pearson subsequently revised its textbook in accordance with the commission\u2019s directions.</p>\n<p>While the IQC may have been successful at removing the term \u201cIndus-Sarasvati Civilization,\u201d it retained a lot of commentary that perpetuates caste erasure, similar to the type that the Hindu groups pushed for during the framework-review process. For example, one Pearson textbook notes that the caste system</p>\n<blockquote><p>brought both costs and benefits. For instance, the system limited people\u2019s individual freedom. The patterns of their lives were fixed at birth. However, some believe that the caste system helped India develop. They feel that it brought stability to Indian society. Indian goods became famous because caste members perfected their skills. The system also allowed different groups to follow their own beliefs.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is difficult to imagine such apologia for oppression being peddled in a US textbook\u2019s chapter about chattel slavery or South African apartheid.</p>\n<p>The Hindu camp has also pressured the publishers by involving them in litigation. A key player in this aspect is the group California Parents for the Equalization of Educational Materials, or CAPEEM, which describes itself as \u201ca group of parents residing in the state of California\u201d that is \u201cdeeply concerned about the indoctrination of Abrahamic religions and the negative descriptions of Hinduism in the History and Social Science textbooks of our state.\u201d CAPEEM has been active for over a decade\u2014in 2006, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://capeem.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/complaint.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">it filed a lawsuit</a></span> against many members of the board of education and the department of education, alleging that the adopted history textbooks put forth \u201cderogatory and unequal treatment of the Hindu religion.\u201d The case ended in <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/hinduamerican-parents-settle-out-of-court-for--175000/474258/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">a settlement in 2009</a></span>, with CAPEEM withdrawing the suit, but receiving $175,000 from the department of education and the board.</p>\n<p>HAF, too, filed a suit against the state board of education in 2006. The foundation claimed that the process that the board had undergone to review textbooks for sixth-grade students was not \u201cfair and open,\u201d and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.rediff.com/news/report/text/20070625.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">the judge ruled</a></span> in HAF\u2019s favour.</p>\n<p>In February last year, CAPEEM <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://capeem.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/complaint2017.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">filed another lawsuit</a></span>, alleging that Hinduism received \u201cunfair and unconstitutional treatment\u201d in the textbooks. In its <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://capeem.org/news-posts/feb-08-2017-capeem-files-lawsuit-challenging-californias-curriculum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">press release</a></span> about the complaint, CAPEEM noted that the adopted framework \u201cdevotes almost half the discussion of Hinduism to the caste system, which it portrays as a supposed Hindu religious belief.\u201d Last year, the board of education moved a motion before a California court to dismiss the case, but the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/california-cant-duck-hindu-students-claim-educational-bias/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">judge declined to dismiss</a></span> one of four claims against the state.</p>\n<p>Soundararajan said that the CAPEEM suit had been an effective way for the Hindu camp to apply pressure to the process. \u201cTheir goal is to basically hang the threat of litigation over this round\u201d\u2014the editing of the textbooks\u2014\u201cso that the state board of education is afraid to actually advocate on behalf of people that aren\u2019t Hindu,\u201d Soundararajan said. \u201cWhen the publishers would ask the state of California for verification about what was happening, they wouldn&#8217;t respond.\u201d She continued, \u201cI think that was specifically because they don\u2019t want any correspondence on the record saying that they may have helped in addressing the issue of caste, because they don\u2019t want to be sued later.\u201d While reporting this story, I reached out multiple times to several individuals affiliated with the department of education\u2014including people on the board and in the IQC\u2014but never received a response.</p>\n<p>CAPEEM and HAF\u2019s abilities to initiate such suits, which generally involve paying handsome legal fees, point towards the steep differential in resources between the two camps. While SAHFA is a coalition of volunteer activists, HAF and HEF are both tax-exempt non-profits that receive considerable money in donations. According to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://www.hafsite.org/sites/default/files/HAF-2016-990-WFINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">HAF\u2019s 2016 tax return</a></span>, the organisation had net assets of over $3.2 million\u2014a jump of $1 million from the previous year. HEF is not a registered non-profit, but the Hindu Swayamsewak Sangh is, and HSS\u2019s tax returns state that the organisation is \u201cdoing business as\u201d the Hindu Education Foundation. The HSS\u2019s <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://990s.foundationcenter.org/990_pdf_archive/521/521647017/521647017_201612_990.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">2016 tax return</a></span> shows that the organisation has assets of over $3.1 million. Curiously, HEF seems to have minimal staff managing these funds\u2014according to its 2016 return, the organisation\u2019s only salaried staff member is Saumitra Gokhale, who supposedly works an average of 40 hours a week and makes $30,000 as a \u201cyoga instructor.\u201d (In an <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://organiser.org/Encyc/2014/10/20/Hindu-Swayamsevak-Sangh--A-Leap-Beyond-the-Shores.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">article on the website of <em>Organiser</em></a></span>, the RSS\u2019s English-language mouthpiece, Gokhale is listed as a \u201cPracharak for America continent.\u201d A <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/simply-put-overseas-swayamsevaks-their-hindutva-project/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">January 2016 article</a></span> in the <em>Indian Express </em>identifies him as the current global coordinator for the HSS).</p>\n<p>Although Shukla and Kalra told me that HEF has also long been a major player on the California textbooks issue, it is difficult to pinpoint the on-the-ground work that the organisation has done, and who has been executing it. What is visible, though, is the organisation\u2019s virulent digital footprint. For instance, a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://www.hindueducation.org/hefs-response-to-last-minute-alarmism-by-fringe-hinduphobic-group-south-asian-histories-for-all/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">post on HEF\u2019s website</a></span> calls SAHFA \u201ca fringe Hinduphobic group\u201d that \u201ctried to derail the textbook adoption process.\u201d HEF also compiled a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.hindueducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/HEFs-response-to-SAHFA-revisions-details.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">list of responses</a></span> to SAHFA\u2019s requested edits, in which it demonstrates even more fervour to whitewash caste than HAF. The list states, for example, that \u201cThe \u2018caste system\u2019 itself, as many scholars of colonialism have shown, is a product of Europe\u2019s colonial encounter.\u201d In response to a requested edit that would detail the fact that Dalits were \u201cforced to do work considered impure,\u201d HEF wrote that \u201cthe suggested edit has political overtones and also is not age appropriate for middle school children.\u201d</p>\n<p>HAF seems keen to hide, or at least wash its hands clean of, the fact that HEF is closely linked with the HSS. When I asked Shukla, HAF\u2019s executive director, whether the organisation had ever worked with the HSS, she said no\u2014and that, at the most, the HSS might have signed one of HAF\u2019s many open letters. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked with HEF,\u201d she added. Kalra, the senior director, described HEF as \u201ca community-based group\u201d that HAF had worked with \u201cthroughout the years.\u201d I then asked him who I should get in touch with from HEF, but he was not able to give me a single name. When I asked him whether the HSS was involved with HEF, he said, \u201cI have no idea about that.\u201d Shukla and Kalra seem to be either woefully ill-informed about their close partners, or intent on remaining evasive about any connections that HAF might have with the Sangh. HEF did not answer my request for an interview.</p>\n<p>During the dispute over framework content, academics played a particularly influential role. Unified under the banner of the \u201cSouth Asian Faculty Group,\u201d many professors signed a letter that detailed the reasons why many of the edits proposed by the Hindu groups were ahistorical and ideologically motivated. A similar letter, with over 90 signatories, was submitted this year, endorsing the specific edits requested by SAHFA.</p>\n<p>The Hindu camp, too, assembled a team of academics this year, who submitted their own <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://www.hafsite.org/sites/default/files/Final%20Academic%20Coalition%20Letter_HSS%20Adoption%20Submission_10.31.17.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">letter</a></span>. It was written primarily by Jeffery Long, a professor of religion and Asian studies at Elizabethtown College, who has previously worked with HAF on a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://www.hafsite.org/media/pr/hindu-americans-expose-online-hate-latest-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">report</a></span> about anti-Hindu bigotry online. With almost 40 signatories, Long\u2019s letter criticised some of the textbooks for their \u201cunderlying Orientalist narrative\u201d and their tendency to put forth \u201cinaccurate and unfavorable comparisons of Hinduism with other religions.\u201d</p>\n<p>But over a lengthy Skype interview with me, Long took a far more moderate tone than that used by HAF, HEF and many others in the Hindu camp. Long said while he thought some of SAHFA\u2019s edits were \u201cHinduphobic,\u201d he also found some of them \u201cquite reasonable\u201d\u2014in particular, their requests to include descriptions of caste oppression. He also criticised the Hindu camp for not engaging in productive dialogue with the opposition. \u201cI think one thing that militates against dialogue is when any critical discussion of Hinduism or Hindu practices is immediately dismissed as Hinduphobic,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way forward. The way to cure a problem is first to acknowledge you have a problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>As this controversy unfolded, other Hindu organisations also came to the fore to express that HAF and HEF did not speak for them. Sadhana, a non-profit that describes itself as a \u201ccoalition of progressive Hindus,\u201d posted <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.sadhana.org/sadhana-speaks/2017/11/3/sadhana-adds-our-voice-to-dont-erase-caste-petition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">a statement</a></span> announcing their solidarity with SAHFA, noting, \u201cSadhana rejects attempts to erase or minimize caste in accounts of Hinduism.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hindus for Justice, a \u201cnetwork of Hindu progressives across the United States,\u201d posted a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://hindusforjustice.org/2017/11/06/hindu-fragility/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">statement</a></span> titled \u201cJust Say No To Hindu Fragility.\u201d It read, \u201cMany Hindus <em>aren\u2019t </em>thin-skinned and afraid. Many of us are able to find pride in what\u2019s best about Hinduism, while still respecting others, acknowledging our faults, and embracing complexity.\u201d The statement continued, \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re proud to stand with South Asian Histories for All \u2026 We\u2019re proud to stand on the right side of history.\u201d</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/californias-textbooks-war-reveals-mounting-influence-hindutva-united-states\">The Latest Skirmish in California\u2019s Textbooks War Reveals the Mounting Influence of Hindutva in the United States</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in\">The Caravan</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/californias-textbooks-war-reveals-mounting-influence-hindutva-united-states/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>2</slash:comments>\n\t<image><![CDATA[<img width=\"751\" height=\"435\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/California-textbooks_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_6th-February-2018.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/California-textbooks_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_6th-February-2018.jpg 751w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/California-textbooks_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_6th-February-2018-300x174.jpg 300w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/California-textbooks_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_6th-February-2018-700x405.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px\" />]]></image>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Editor\u2019s Pick</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/editors-corner/editors-pick-47</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/editors-corner/editors-pick-47#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2018 15:59:50 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[webmaster]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Editor's Corner]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.caravanmagazine.in/?p=35103</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>ON 11 FEBRUARY 1916, while on her way to deliver a lecture on atheism in New York City, a 46-year-old woman named Emma Goldman was arrested on charges of obscenity for lecturing on and dispensing information related to birth control.

She was accused of violating the Comstock Act of 1873, which made it a federal offence for anyone, including doctors, to distribute information about contraception.</p>\n<p>Born to a Jewish family in Russia in 1869, Goldman emigrated to the United States in 1885 and worked in New York as a nurse and midwife for 25 years. She soon realised that birth control would be crucial in the struggle for women to achieve economic and social equality, and she became an advocate for women\u2019s reproductive rights.</p>\n<p>Goldman\u2014who was also known as \u201cRed Emma\u201d\u2014was arrested multiple times for her political activism and anarchism; she was even deported to Russia in December 1919 for allegedly urging people against drafting in the World War. Her trial in 1916 sparked national discussions on birth control and attracted the support of many writers, artists and public intellectuals. After serving a two-week-sentence at a prison workhouse, she wrote a letter to the press in which she said, \u201cWhile I am not particularly anxious to go to jail, I should yet to be glad to do so, if thereby I can add my might to the importance of birth control and the wiping of our antiquated law upon the statue.\u201d</p>\n<p>Over 3,000 people gathered for a meeting at the Carnegie Hall in May 1916 to celebrate Emma Goldman\u2019s release and glean more information about birth control. Later that year, Margaret Sanger, an activist and women\u2019s-rights campaigner, opened the first birth-control clinic in Brooklyn, New York, although it was shut down shortly after.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/editors-corner/editors-pick-47\">Editor\u2019s Pick</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in\">The Caravan</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/editors-corner/editors-pick-47/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<image><![CDATA[<img width=\"310\" height=\"435\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/01_Editors-Pick_The-Caravan-magazine_February_2018.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/01_Editors-Pick_The-Caravan-magazine_February_2018.jpg 310w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/01_Editors-Pick_The-Caravan-magazine_February_2018-214x300.jpg 214w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px\" />]]></image>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>I Wish To Let You Fall Out Of My Hands</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/showcase/wish-let-fall-hands</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/showcase/wish-let-fall-hands#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2018 11:13:25 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[webmaster]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Showcase]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.caravanmagazine.in/?p=35106</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>30 JANUARY TO 3 MARCH EXPERIMENTER, KOLKATA This exhibition is a poetic examination of longing, memory, identity, dislocation and loss.

I want to thank all the organisers and all the volunteers who made this event possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was December 2013, and Jagmeet Singh was addressing an award ceremony taking place in Punjab, hosted by the Social Educational Welfare Association, in association with International Fateh Academy. A legislator in Ontario\u2014Canada\u2019s largest province\u2014Jagmeet was receiving SEWA\u2019s \u201cSikh of the Year\u201d award, given to a Sikh who has \u201covercome challenges to restore the honour and pride of Sikhism and to spread its fragrance in the entire world.\u201d He made it clear why he was, quite literally, an attractive choice.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe largest daily newspaper in Canada, the <em>Toronto Star</em>, recognised me as one of 2012\u2019s top 12 people or 12 personalities for the year,\u201d Jagmeet said. \u201cI was also recognised and put on the front page of the largest Canadian fashion magazine as Toronto\u2019s most stylish.\u201d The catalogue of accolades went on. \u201cI was recognised in the list of Toronto\u2019s 50 most influential people as one of the five rising stars on the verge of greatness,\u201d he said, \u201cand all of this I have to attribute to my principles and beliefs in Sikhi. I want to make sure that\u2019s very clear.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jagmeet was speaking in a mix of English and Punjabi. He emphasised how, as an elected official, he had promoted \u201cSikhi values,\u201d spearheaded efforts to get the massacre of Sikhs in India in 1984 recognised as a genocide, campaigned to have kirpans allowed inside courthouses and have April designated as Sikh Heritage Month in his province.</p>\n<p>Though he was indeed on \u201cthe verge of greatness,\u201d Singh\u2019s address to SEWA seemed somewhat muted. \u201cI had prepared to be there in person,\u201d Jagmeet, impeccably dressed in a three-piece suit and a yellow turban, explained. \u201cBut it is very sad that the Indian government did not give me permission to reach you.\u201d He was delivering his address from behind a desk cluttered with papers, books and files, via videoconference, while thousands of kilometres away in Canada.</p>\n<p>The Indian government\u2019s decision to bar Jagmeet\u2019s entry in 2013 was historic\u2014he became the first Western legislator ever to be denied a visa to the country\u2014and made news in both Canada and India. It was particularly surprising because Jagmeet had visited the country earlier that same year. In an op-ed for the <em>Ottawa Citizen</em>, Jagmeet argued that, by this act of exclusion, India had jeopardised its ties with Canada. \u201cIt is my belief that the relationship is now in question and the international community must defend Canada\u2019s place as a country whose law-abiding citizens are welcomed by the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>When asked to explain why Jagmeet\u2019s visa application was denied, India\u2019s consul-general in Canada at the time tersely told reporters that people \u201cwho seek to undermine\u201d Indian political institutions and \u201cfoment contempt to the country\u201d were only \u201cmisusing the pretext of human rights to pursue their insidious agenda of disrupting the social fabric of India.\u201d Although there was no official statement on why Jagmeet was suddenly persona non grata with the Indian government, many concluded that it had to do with his activism around the 1984 Sikh massacre and his perceived ties with Sikh separatists.</p>\n<p>To the likely consternation of Indian officials, less than four years later, in October 2017, Jagmeet was elected to head Canada\u2019s New Democratic Party\u2014becoming the first non-white, non-aboriginal member of a minority to lead one of Canada\u2019s three main political parties. His achievement made international headlines, and prompted celebration from socially conscious Canadians in general and the country\u2019s young, progressive Sikhs in particular.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #666666\">(Subscribe to <em>The Caravan</em> to read the full story. <u><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/digital-subscriptions\">Click here</a></u> for a digital subscription or email subscription@delhipress.in for a print subscription.)</span></p>\n<div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/jagmeet-singh-hard-questions-facing-canada-multiculturalism-poster-boy\">Model Minority</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in\">The Caravan</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/jagmeet-singh-hard-questions-facing-canada-multiculturalism-poster-boy/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<image><![CDATA[<img width=\"290\" height=\"435\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/01_Model-Minority_The-Caravan-magazine_February_2018.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/01_Model-Minority_The-Caravan-magazine_February_2018.jpg 290w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/01_Model-Minority_The-Caravan-magazine_February_2018-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" />]]></image>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Bearing The Cross</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/pakistan-christians-struggle-keep-the-faith</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/pakistan-christians-struggle-keep-the-faith#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2018 08:58:48 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[webmaster]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Reportage]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.caravanmagazine.in/?p=35194</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>THE RIDES AT LAHORE\u2019S\u00a0famous Gulshan-e-Iqbal Park open for business at around 5 pm.

Hundreds of people mill around the sprawling 66-acre park all day, and the most enthusiastic of them\u2014the children\u2014wait for ride operators to take up their positions in small cabins, from where they run a giant Ferris wheel, merry-go-rounds and fancy swirling teacups. The park is open to people from all backgrounds, but on Easter Sunday of 2016, a particularly large number of the park\u2019s estimated 30,000 visitors were Christians.</p>\n<p>At around 6.25 pm, most of the visitors were packed into the fairground area near Gate 5, where dozens of children had queued in front of two popular rides. Just then, between the two rides and Gate 5, a suicide bomber detonated ten kilograms of explosives packed inside his vest. The blast killed at least 72 people, and although the attackers had announced that they were targeting the Christians celebrating Easter, most of the victims were Muslim.</p>\n<p>The attack was claimed by Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, a splinter group of the militant organisation Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan. Jamaat-ul-Ahrar had also claimed the twin suicide bombings at churches in Lahore\u2019s Youhanabad area the year before, which had killed over 20 people and sparked a violent protest in the locality that left two Muslim men dead. But there was no protest this time.</p>\n<p>Instead, on the day of the blast, protests were being held in a different city for very different reasons. As ambulances raced, sirens screaming, through Lahore\u2019s streets, trying to get the hundreds of injured to hospitals, around 20,000 agitators gathered in Islamabad and created a trail of destruction as they marched on the parliament with the express intent of burning it down. The demonstration marked the end of the mourning period for Mumtaz Qadri, who had been hanged for murdering Salman Taseer, a governor of Pakistan\u2019s state of Punjab who had criticised the country\u2019s blasphemy laws. They pitched camps and presented their list of demands, including the execution of Asia Bibi\u2014a Christian woman accused of blasphemy, whom Taseer was killed for defending. The protesters torched a metro bus, ransacked a metro bus station, destroyed private vehicles parked on roads, breached the high-security Red Zone and surrounded the parliament before the army was called in.</p>\n<p>Reeling from the attack on the park in Lahore, the Christian leadership\u2019s only condemnations and consolations came mostly through either the government-approved channel of the Pakistan Ulema Council or through Facebook videos. I spoke to several of Lahore\u2019s church leaders, who explained that they did not want to present themselves as potential targets anymore. They had strict directions from the government not to protest or hold public shows of grief or memorials for those deceased. \u201cWe were told that we would lose any guarantee of security from the state if we did,\u201d one of the bishops told me.</p>\n<p><strong>FOR DECADES</strong>, the Christian minority of Pakistan has lived a marginalised existence. According to the theologian Duncan B Forrester\u2019s book <em>Forrester on Christian Ethics and Practical Theology</em>, most Christians in Pakistan were formerly members of disadvantaged Hindu castes, and were converted by missionaries of the Catholic Church and the Church Mission Society. Today, many of them live in Christian-only villages and slums around Pakistan\u2019s big cities, and hold jobs such as those of tenant farmers, sanitary workers and factory workers.</p>\n<p>Over the last few years, the community has faced extreme violence at the hands of Islamic militants. A year before the attack on Gulshan-e-Iqbal Park, two blasts in Lahore churches killed at least 17 people. Before that, in September 2013, twin suicide bombers killed 127 people and injured more than 250 others when they attacked a church in Peshawar.</p>\n<p>But sporadic violence is only one among a multitude of problems faced by the country\u2019s Christians. They live in a religiously hostile environment, where intolerance is not harboured by extremists alone.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #666666\">(Subscribe to <em>The Caravan</em> to read the full story. <u><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/digital-subscriptions\">Click here</a></u> for a digital subscription or email subscription@delhipress.in for a print subscription.)</span></p>\n<div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/pakistan-christians-struggle-keep-the-faith\">Bearing The Cross</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in\">The Caravan</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/pakistan-christians-struggle-keep-the-faith/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<image><![CDATA[<img width=\"615\" height=\"435\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/01_Bearing-The-Cross_The-Caravan-magazine_February_2018.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/01_Bearing-The-Cross_The-Caravan-magazine_February_2018.jpg 615w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/01_Bearing-The-Cross_The-Caravan-magazine_February_2018-300x212.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px\" />]]></image>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Temple Run</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/perspectives/karnataka-real-devout-hindus-please-stand-up</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/perspectives/karnataka-real-devout-hindus-please-stand-up#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2018 08:57:39 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[webmaster]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Perspectives]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Assembly Elections]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[BJP]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[BS Yeddyurappa]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Hindutva]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Karnataka]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Lingayat]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Narendra Modi]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Siddaramaiah]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.caravanmagazine.in/?p=35224</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>On 7 December 2017, Karnataka\u2019s chief minister, the Congress leader Siddaramaiah, addressed an event in the Uttara Kannada district marking the inauguration of several public-works programmes by the state government. \u201cThey accuse us of being anti-Hindu.

Are we not Hindus?\u201d he asked the audience. \u201cMy name is Siddarama. My name too has <em>bhagwan</em> Ram\u2019s name. We are the devotees of Lord Rama and Hanuman. \u2026 The real Hindu is one who loves all religions. You judge who the real Hindus are. Us or BJP leaders?\u201d</p>\n<p>Then, the minister for public works in Siddaramaiah\u2019s government, HC Mahadevappa, took the stage and also declared his allegiance to Hinduism. And soon after, the medium- and large-scale industries minister, RV Deshpande, informed the audience that he too was a devout Hindu. \u201cBy birth, I am a Hindu,\u201d Deshpande said. \u201cAll other people are my <em>bandhu</em>\u201d\u2014brothers.</p>\n<p>Siddaramaiah and his ministers\u2019 scramble to prove their Hindu credentials surprised many in the state. For years, the chief minister had embraced the moniker of an \u201c<em>ahinda</em>\u201d leader\u2014a Kannada term that is an acronym for minorities, backward classes and Dalits.</p>\n<p>Siddaramaiah\u2019s comments seemed to be in sync with the speculation that the Congress will again adopt a \u201csoft Hindutva\u201d strategy to counter the Bharatiya Janata Party in the upcoming state-assembly election. The Congress president, Rahul Gandhi, had made several highly publicised visits to temples in Gujarat ahead of the recent polls in that state, and had also talked about his religious affiliations. Congress leaders have said that Gandhi will be seen temple-hopping during the campaign in Karnataka too.</p>\n<p>The fact that Siddaramaiah and his fellow ministers took the initiative early on is an indication of how much the party is depending on its state leadership to win this election. The contrary is the case with the BJP, whose state leadership has looked weak, and cannot bank merely on the history of anti-incumbency. The BJP\u2019s campaign will have to rely heavily on Modi\u2019s enduring popularity and the party\u2019s Hindutva rhetoric. The Congress\u2019s soft Hindutva approach is an attempt to neutralise the BJP\u2019s pitch.</p>\n<p>Karnataka\u2019s voters have been famous for alternating parties in every election since 1985. However, this anti-incumbency is more nuanced than meets the eye. In 2013, the BJP went to polls after five years of lacklustre rule marred by corruption, sleaze, dissidence and countless incidents of moral policing by fringe elements of the Sangh Parivar. Although the BJP expectedly lost the election, a closer reading of the results suggests that voters did not decisively choose the Congress. The party won the election not so much because people overwhelmingly voted in favour of it, but rather, because of a three-way split in the expected BJP vote caused by the presence of the Karnataka Janata Party, or KJP, floated by the former BJP chief minister BS Yeddyurappa, and the Badavara Shramikara Raitara Congress, or BSR Congress, led by the former BJP state minister B Sriramulu. In the 120 constituencies where the Congress won, the combined votes polled by the BJP and the two splinter parties far exceeded the votes polled by the Congress. The BJP\u2019s vote-share declined by roughly 13 percent, from 34 percent in 2008 to 20 percent in 2013. But the reduction in the BJP\u2019s vote share was nearly just as much as the combined vote-share of the KJP and BSR Congress. The KJP polled 10 percent and the BSRC secured 2.7 percent of votes.</p>\n<p>Similarly, in 2004, the Congress government led by SM Krishna went to the polls on the back of a good performance in government, but lost nevertheless. The BJP emerged as the single largest party, but was short of a majority in the 224-member assembly. The party had to wait until 2008 to come to power on its own, after elections were held follwing a spell of governor\u2019s rule, precipitated by the fall of the BJP\u2019s coalition government, formed with the support of the former prime minister, HD Deve Gowda\u2019s Janata Dal (Secular). If this trend is any indication, then even if voters deliver a harsh verdict against the Congress this time, one cannot take it for granted that their alternative choice will be the BJP. The presence of the JD(S), which has strong pockets of support in parts of Vokkaliga-dominated southern Karnataka, further complicates matters for the two main contenders.</p>\n<p>The BJP\u2019s state leadership, represented by its chief-ministerial candidate BS Yeddyurappa, does not look strong. Yeddyurappa no longer wields the kind of clout he enjoyed within and outside the party in 2008, when he led it to victory. Corruption charges, which he continues to fight in the courts, and the stigma of having been the first chief minister in the state to go to jail, have tarnished his image among voters. He has lost the respect of the party rank-and-file because of his desertion of the BJP in the previous election. Yet the BJP decided to project him as its chief-ministerial candidate, considering him the unchallenged leader of the powerful Lingayat community, whose votes are crucial for it. However, in a strange twist to the tale, he is no longer seen as the pivot around which all Lingayats will rally. A faction of the community has launched a movement demanding the status of a separate minority religious group for the Lingayats. While the Congress has pledged its moral support to the cause, the BJP is in a bind, as it cannot back any effort to break Hindu unity. Although it is not yet clear how this agitation is going to affect the election, those who support the movement have been questioning the BJP and Yeddyurappa over their silence on the issue. This means it is no longer a foregone conclusion that the Lingayats will vote en masse for the BJP and Yeddyurappa. Meanwhile, the dissent within the party is refusing to die down. Media reports said that the recent <em>parivarthana yathra</em> that Yeddyurappa took out across the state, as a prelude to the election campaign, witnessed a poor turnout, mainly because of the infighting in the party, which came to the fore in many places where Yeddyurappa addressed public meetings. In Bidar, for example, two factions put up separate stages, forcing him to address the crowds from both.</p>\n<p>With no strong state leadership to steer the campaign, no big issues to attack the government on and no assured Lingayat vote bank, the BJP\u2019s election strategy seems to revolve entirely around Modi and Hindutva. Amit Shah, the BJP president, has been making repeated visits to the state to galvanise the cadre for booth-level work. For the task of communal polarisation, the party has roped in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s chief minister, Adityanath. During the two rallies he has addressed in the state so far, his speeches focussed primarily on religious issues. The party has declared that the UP chief minister is going to be one of its star campaigners. Union minister, Anant Kumar Hegde, a five-time member of the Lok Sabha from the Uttara Kannada constituency, has attacked the \u201cminority-appeasement\u201d politics of the Congress. He did not stop his provocative speeches even after he was made to apologise in parliament for his recent disparaging remarks on secularists. The state\u2019s coastal belt, consisting of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Uttara Kannada districts, has seen a series of communally motivated murders over the past five years. Although both Hindus and Muslims have been victims of communal tension, the BJP has accused the Congress of siding with the Muslims and carrying out a massacre of the Hindus.</p>\n<p>To build on this groundwork, Modi is slated to address a series of rallies, starting in the last week of January. His popularity, illustrated by the BJP\u2019s victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, would definitely help the BJP. In that election, just a year after the BJP\u2019s rout in the Karnataka assembly polls, the party won 17 of the 28 seats in the state. Demonetisation and GST do not seem to have dented Modi\u2019s image much.</p>\n<p>However, in Karnataka, Modi will be up against a powerful state leader in Siddaramaiah. When he assumed office as chief minister five years ago, Siddaramaiah already had the image of an able administrator. The media often characterised him as a \u201cbureaucratic politician,\u201d which meant he was good at governance but weak as a political strategist. But five years down the line, the perception appears to be on the verge of a reversal. Siddaramaiah\u2019s administration seems to have nothing spectacular to boast of, but his record as a politician has surprised many. He dealt a big blow to the JD(S) by poaching seven of its MLAs. He also managed well the insider-outsider conflict within the Congress\u2014between original partymen and those who joined the Congress from other parties. Although he joined the Congress in 2006 from the JD(S), he has emerged as the unchallenged leader of the party in Karnataka. Siddaramaiah has assiduously tried to cultivate the support of the Other Backward Classes and the state\u2019s minorities by significantly increasing the budget of the social-welfare department.</p>\n<p>The Congress has also been playing the regional card in order to counter the BJP\u2019s nationalist agenda. A water dispute over the Mahadayi River between Karnataka and BJP-ruled Goa has become an election issue. Modi\u2019s unwillingness to intervene in the dispute has been held up as an example of how the prime minister and the BJP have been discriminating against Karnataka. The Congress is also repeatedly reminding voters that Modi has done nothing to help Karnataka in its longtime feud with neighbouring Tamil Nadu over sharing the Kaveri River\u2019s water. It has also tried to whip up pro-Kannada sentiment by proposing a separate flag for Karnataka, and resisting the use of Hindi in government communication in the state. The Congress is using the BJP\u2019s silence on these issues to argue that Karnataka\u2019s interests are not safe under the BJP, and that the latter pursues a nationalist agenda at the cost of the states. But, being a national party, the Congress has obvious limitations in its attempts to play up regional identity politics and language issues.</p>\n<p>At the moment, it appears that Siddaramaiah\u2019s leadership and an alternative version of Hindutva are the two main weapons in the Congress armoury that could halt the Modi juggernaut. In all likelihood, therefore, the Congress\u2019s new electoral strategy of inclusive Hindutva is going to have its first real litmus test in the upcoming Karnataka election.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/perspectives/karnataka-real-devout-hindus-please-stand-up\">Temple Run</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in\">The Caravan</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/perspectives/karnataka-real-devout-hindus-please-stand-up/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<image><![CDATA[<img width=\"652\" height=\"435\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/01_Temple-Run_The-Caravan-Magazine_February_2018.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/01_Temple-Run_The-Caravan-Magazine_February_2018.jpg 652w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/01_Temple-Run_The-Caravan-Magazine_February_2018-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px\" />]]></image>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>A Modest Proposal</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/perspectives/a-modest-proposal-smog-delhi-poor-children-citizens-satire</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/perspectives/a-modest-proposal-smog-delhi-poor-children-citizens-satire#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2018 08:42:47 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[webmaster]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Perspectives]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Air pollution]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Delhi]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[environment]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[satire]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.caravanmagazine.in/?p=35219</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The roads of the capital are shrouded in a haze.

The toxicity of the air is at many times the permitted level by global standards. International flights are being cancelled. Visiting cricket teams refuse to play on our fields. Schools are often closed. Simply breathing in Delhi is now equivalent to smoking around 40 cigarettes a day.</p>\n<p>We act as if we had not expected this occurrence and cannot understand how to solve it. We purchase face masks and air purifiers and grumble about the air. We wait for it to pass. But it never passes, because the air is toxic all year round. Only for a very short period, in the rainy season, does the amount of particulate matter dip to permissible levels. As a father, I am deeply concerned about the permanent damage being done to my three-year-old daughter\u2019s health, as indeed to the health of all the city\u2019s children. Even the protection I can afford to provide my child, by travelling in the metro or in air-conditioned cars and having her sleeping with an air purifier at night, cannot shield her from all exposure to the air.</p>\n<p>It makes me depressed to drive through this great capital when I see the streets and traffic intersections crowded with homeless people in rags, followed by children of three or four, banging on the windows of every passing car demanding alms, exposed to air of a toxicity I shudder to imagine. They have no air-conditioned cars or air purifiers, and are forced to employ all their time on the roads, begging for sustenance.</p>\n<p>I think everyone would agree that the prodigious number of children at our intersections tagging along with their mothers, and frequently their fathers, is in the present deplorable state of the national capital a very great tragedy, even aside from the fact that they obstruct traffic, and are a threat to themselves and others.</p>\n<p>But my thoughts at this time are far from being confined to only the children of professed beggars; they are of a much greater extent, and consider the whole population of infants in the national capital born of parents who are not able to provide them with the kind of care and protection they need to become healthy, productive members of society. Is anyone thinking about their, and our, collective future? In the absence of any genuine schemes to improve their condition, the reality is that many children, too many, continue to be employed as labourers in hotels and shops, in carpet-making and embroidery workshops, and in a whole range of industries, so that they can contribute to their and their families\u2019 upkeep. But even their pathetic state is not as alarming as that of children who are abducted, trafficked and forced into sex work, or into slave-like labour in sugarcane fields or brick kilns. Under these circumstances, perhaps it is time to think of solutions which are out of the ordinary, which reflect visionary thinking about the future instead of simply parroting the same old failed mantras of universal education and poverty reduction.</p>\n<p>The population of the capital is estimated at 19 million people, of which, according to my calculation, 4 million are children aged four and below. From this, we can subtract 50,000 children like my own child, whose parents are able to provide them with the best education and equip them to be global citizens of the future. We can also perhaps subtract, at most, an additional 200,000 children whose parents are conscientious and able enough to guarantee their progeny a basic private-school education, which will at least ensure that they gain some fluency in English and thus become employable in service positions with reputable Indian or multinational firms. This being granted, there will remain 3.75 million children. I can again subtract 200,000 children of poor parents who will be admitted to good private schools under the present regime of quotas, study hard and thrive, and another 50,000 who may demonstrate special talents, as the children of the poor often do, as, say, singers on Indian Idol, or Slumdog Millionaires or tearaway fast bowlers for the Indian Premier League. But there still remain 3.5 million children with no future.</p>\n<p>The question, therefore, is how these millions of children shall be made to become proud, productive and contributing members of our society. Unlike the children of peasants in the countryside, they can neither work the land nor make handicrafts. And few are able to develop the fine motor skills required for pickpocketing till they reach the age of ten\u2014except in certain parts of the country such as Kolkata, where I was informed by an officer in a boys\u2019 probationary home that many of the inmates were third-generation pickpockets, who began practising at the tender age of four by discreetly slicing open bags of rice, and were renowned for the quickest proficiency in the art.</p>\n<p>In Delhi, in interviews with employers in embroidery workshops and roadside dhabas as part of a social-scientific study of an industrial neighbourhood, my colleagues and I discovered that children below the age of ten have no economic value. Parents cannot sell children past that age for above Rs 3,000, and even then a child needs to work for many years to repay the employer\u2019s investment.</p>\n<p>Let me now humbly propose my own thoughts on this matter, which I hope you will read through in full without prejudgment.</p>\n<p>Research by paediatric pulmonologists at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences shows that a child of the age of two, when well nursed and cared for, can each day inhale and absorb, without immediately falling ill, a quantity of pollutants equivalent to that produced by as many as 40 cigarettes. If properly conditioned, particularly to nurture lung capacity, by the age of four a child\u2019s daily intake and absorption of pollutants can reach quantities closer to those produced by 200 cigarettes.</p>\n<p>I therefore propose that the capital\u2019s 3.5 million otherwise future-less children be trained to be Purifying Organisms for Toxic Air, or POTAs, for our city. At the age of two, they shall be sent to organic farms in the Himalayan foothills, where they will receive fresh food, clean air and water, and a daily regime of eight hours of yoga breathing exercises. Upon reaching the age of four, they shall be fitted with enormous funnels in their gullets, and organised into teams of gaspers, to be posted in rotating shifts at intersections across the National Capital Region.</p>\n<p>I have spoken to highly placed officials in the Delhi government, who have committed to initially hire 100,000 POTAs on a contract basis to serve at five busy intersections\u2014at Ashram, Anand Vihar ISBT, Punjabi Bagh, ITO and Azadpur Mandi\u2014and to arrange for enough open green space at these locations to accommodate large teams of gaspers and offset their carbon-dioxide emissions. Delhi\u2019s Indira Gandhi International Airport has pledged to hire 375,000 POTAs to be stationed along all final-approach routes to improve visibility. The Delhi and District Cricket Association has agreed that visiting international cricket teams will be provided with POTAs as per their requirements. The starting allocation will be for a cordon of five gaspers around each foreign fielder from a third-world country, and seven around each fielder from a first-world one. Fast bowlers will be granted retinues of up to 20 gaspers to chase them on their run-ups, medium-pacers up to 15, and spinners up to 12, upon request. Additionally, batsmen will be allowed up to 20 POTAs each to accompany them while running between the wickets.</p>\n<p>POTAs who prove to be exceptional gaspers will be rewarded with plush postings at government events such as the Republic Day parade, the opening of the flower gardens at Rashtrapati Bhavan, and state visits by the Queen of England or the president of the United States of America.</p>\n<p>Of the 3.5 million POTAs, one million will be kept available at all times for private functions, such as polo matches, lawn parties at the Gymkhana Club and weddings at Chhattarpur farmhouses. Wedding season in Delhi will become a dazzling affair, with squadrons of between 5,000 and 10,000 youngsters, resplendent in sherwanis and lehenga-cholis, marching before the processional brass band, the groom\u2019s white steed and myriad revellers, sucking clean the air in their path.</p>\n<p>Some persons are greatly concerned about the life expectancy of POTAs, which I confess will mercifully not be as long as that of workers employed today in the open dump at the capital\u2019s Ghazipur landfill, which by my records is 39 years. The extended lifespan of these persons is due to the inexpedient use of their resources, as a result of which they spend long stretches in unemployment in between phases of productive labour, which invariably stretches the duration of their lives. Regressions run by a private consulting firm of international repute suggest that, all variables considered, POTAs will expire after six years of full service, at the age of ten, at which stage they will be rationally disposed of.</p>\n<p>I was recently discussing this scheme with an eminent environmentalist, a true lover of this nation\u2019s green spaces, whose values I highly esteem, who offered a refinement upon my scheme. He said that many gentlemen of this city who own farmhouses feel that the charm of patrician country living has been entirely lost because of the foulness of the air. To own a farmhouse without being able to have a shandy in a planter\u2019s chair on the verandah while the sun fades away in an auburn haze is as good as not having a farmhouse at all. My gentleman friend suggested that POTAs displaying better social graces may be employed in such farmhouses, where they may, in between gasps, also recite short poems on nature\u2019s bounty in the Queen\u2019s English. With due deference to my friend\u2019s suggestion, I cannot be altogether in his sentiments; for as scientists at AIIMS who have studied the matter assure me, to maximise the lung capacity of children requires single-minded focus on breathing, leaving little time for side ventures such as learning the rudiments of reading and writing, much less English Romantic poetry. Besides, it is not improbable that some scrupulous people might be apt to censure such a practice (although indeed very unjustly), as a little bordering upon the insensitive; which, I confess, has always been with me the strongest objection against any project, however so well intended.</p>\n<p>But I considered the proposal of my friend, who said this inspired idea was put into his head by an account he had read of his great-grandfather, who served as a district magistrate in Midnapore, where he taught his punkah-pullers not only to make gin and tonics but also to recite \u201cThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner\u201d and, in the case of one particularly clever chap named Hamza, three Latin stanzas from the Aeneid.</p>\n<p>Those with a fetish for costly high-tech gimmickry have proposed alternative schemes for purifying the capital\u2019s air. The defence ministry has been in close communication with its counterpart in Israel ever since the thawing of bilateral relations under the present government. Inspired by Israel\u2019s missile-defence system, an invisible contraption referred to in the media as an Iron Dome, the ministry proposes to construct a literal dome over the entire National Capital Region. This will not only keep out foreign missiles but also external pollutants\u2014such as those, as per a National Intelligence Agency study, being deliberately launched into our airspace by the aggressive burning of agricultural material in Pakistan. To expel pollutants produced within the capital itself, the ministry proposes to commission an elaborate network of suction fans feeding into a 500-kilometre pipeline to the border crossing at Wagah, where the black air will be thrust upon our enemies.</p>\n<p>I think the advantages of the proposal I have made over such schemes are obvious, as well as of the highest importance. For one, it is organic and entirely sustainable, the supply of futureless children within our present system being almost limitless. For another, it would reduce the toxicity not only of our air but also our social body. There may be those with vested interests in the status quo who say that it cannot be done. But society can be changed and so can individuals. We can make a difference if we but try. As a gesture of good faith I would offer up my own progeny for service as a POTA, but she will soon be four and past the training age for gasping.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/perspectives/a-modest-proposal-smog-delhi-poor-children-citizens-satire\">A Modest Proposal</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in\">The Caravan</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/perspectives/a-modest-proposal-smog-delhi-poor-children-citizens-satire/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<image><![CDATA[<img width=\"236\" height=\"435\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/02_A-Modest-Proposal_The-Caravan-Magazine_February_2018.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/02_A-Modest-Proposal_The-Caravan-Magazine_February_2018.jpg 236w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/02_A-Modest-Proposal_The-Caravan-Magazine_February_2018-163x300.jpg 163w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px\" />]]></image>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>A Pack of Troubles</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/lede/spiti-stray-dog-problem</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/lede/spiti-stray-dog-problem#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2018 08:39:16 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[webmaster]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[The Lede]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.caravanmagazine.in/?p=35233</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>On a windy afternoon in July, Moolchand walked into Kibber, a village in the Spiti Valley in northeastern Himachal Pradesh, following closely at the heels of a foreign tourist. \u201cMoolchand ji,\u201d a passerby called out. \u201cIzzat toh deni chahiye\u201d\u2014you should show some respect.

A group of people, waiting for the daily bus out of Kibber, laughed. Moolchand, a friendly and trusting dog, is regarded with affection by tourists and tolerated by villagers, even when he wanders near the sheep pens.</p>\n<p>But the treatment he receives is rare. In this corner of the Himalayas, dogs are entangled in a difficult conflict with locals. Spiti has long been a pastoral economy, and it depends on livestock\u2014sheep, goats, horses, yak, donkeys and dzo\u2014to provide resources such as meat, manure and wool. A study published in January 2017, in the Swedish journal <em>Ambio</em>, found that feral dogs were responsible for a little over 63 percent of the livestock deaths in Spiti, and 80 percent of those that died were sheep and goats. Chandrima Home, a doctoral student at the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment, Bengaluru, and the lead researcher of the study, found that over the span of one year, dogs had killed 238 livestock in 25 villages. Although sterilisation was thought to be the best way to tackle this problem, local enthusiasm for participating in sterilisation camps has dwindled. According to Home, culling measures need to be considered. \u201cI think we have to come to terms with the fact that we have to physically remove some dogs from the landscape,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it has to be done systematically and in a humane manner.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #666666\">(Subscribe to <em>The Caravan</em> to read the full story. <u><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/digital-subscriptions\">Click here</a></u> for a digital subscription or email subscription@delhipress.in for a print subscription.)</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/lede/spiti-stray-dog-problem\">A Pack of Troubles</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in\">The Caravan</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/lede/spiti-stray-dog-problem/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<image><![CDATA[<img width=\"653\" height=\"435\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/01_A-Pack-of-Troubles_The-Caravan-Magazine_February_2018.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/01_A-Pack-of-Troubles_The-Caravan-Magazine_February_2018.jpg 653w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/01_A-Pack-of-Troubles_The-Caravan-Magazine_February_2018-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 653px) 100vw, 653px\" />]]></image>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Barren Land</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/lede/saffron-farmer-kashmir-crop-failure</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/lede/saffron-farmer-kashmir-crop-failure#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2018 08:38:24 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[webmaster]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[The Lede]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.caravanmagazine.in/?p=35231</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Mohammad Habib Mir looked pensive as he walked towards his saffron field on a cold day in November.

We had just arrived at P\u0159edlice, a neighbourhood 15 minutes by bus from the desolate centre of \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem, a visibly poor industrial town near the Czech-German border. Gesturing at the graffiti, grime and abandoned buildings that bordered the open field in front of us, Bro<em>\u017e</em>, the 38-year-old president of Konexe, a Prague-based Roma-rights NGO, described P\u0159edlice and its dilapidated housing as \u201cthe worst Roma ghetto in the country.\u201d</p>\n<p>The conditions under which the Roma or Romani\u2014a traditionally itinerant group, comprising between 10 and 12 million people in Europe\u2014live in the Czech Republic are particularly dire. According to a survey conducted in 2015 by the European Commission, respondents in the Czech Republic reported the most negative views towards the Roma out of all respondents in countries of\u00a0 the European Union. The Czech Roma\u201448 percent of whom live below the poverty line\u2014are three times more likely than the general population to have gone no further than primary school, and face unemployment rates as high as 90 percent in some communities.</p>\n<p>The Roma experience hostility across the European continent. A 2016 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, an American think tank, found that 48 percent of respondents, largely from western European countries, had an \u201cunfavourable\u201d view of the Roma. This included respondents in Italy, France and Germany. France began deportations of Roma in 2009, under the then president Nicolas Sarkozy. Despite the European Parliament\u2019s objections, expulsions continued during the remaining three years of Sarkozy\u2019s term, and intensified under his successor, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, with more than 56,000 Romani deported between 2012 and 2017.</p>\n<p>Studies suggest that roughly 1,500 years ago, the Roma left the mountains of northern India and began to settle on the steppes of the Caucuses, before starting to arrive in Eastern Europe in the 1100s. From there, Roma groups took disparate paths, but there have been attempts at organising them under a cohesive identity in the past two centuries. In 1933, for instance, the first Congress of the \u201cUnited Gypsies of Europe\u201d adopted green and blue horizontal bars as the Roma flag; in 1971, a 16-spoked chakra was overlaid on that design; in 2016, the Indian minister of external affairs declared that the Roma were \u201cchildren of India.\u201d Although some Roma groups are enthusiastic about creating a shared identity, discourse on the Roma has pointed out the difficulty in a non-territorial, traditionally itinerant group seeing itself as unified.</p>\n<p>On the evening of 30 April 2017, Bro\u017e joined dozens of Roma families in a field at the eastern corner of the Roma neighbourhood. It was Carodejnice, Walpurgis Night, or \u201cthe Night of Witches,\u201d when vast crowds across the Czech Republic gather around fires and consume sausages and beer in a night-long celebration. Children chased each other around a scarecrow witch on the field, while a few women roasted pork sausages over an open fire and clusters of men stood around drinking beer. In the middle of the clearing, a Catholic priest prepared for a mass that would later be celebrated on the soft grass, in the shadow of the scarecrow witch, circled by empty cans.</p>\n<p>At one edge of the field, Veronika Kmetzov\u00e1 stencilled big letters onto a blank white banner to spell out <em>\u201cAmare P</em><em>\u0159</em><em>edlice\u201d</em>\u2014Our P\u0159edlice. She stood in front of another banner with a picture of what appeared to be a pig farm called Lety. A farm of that name was a concentration camp for Roma people during the Second World War. Kmetzov\u00e1\u2019s great-grandmother had lived, worked and died there. \u201cMy grandmother told me once about a pile of dead bodies in the camp, and how weak my grandfather was,\u201d she said. It is a history she was both aware of but also distant from while growing up, as it was rarely brought up by her family. Kmetzov\u00e1 said she first visited the camp several years ago. \u201cWe definitely left with heavy hearts,\u201d she said. She thought it was her duty to see the place, learn the history and teach it to her children. She felt that it is important for the Roma to recognise what happened to them collectively, and to ensure that the memory of it stays alive.</p>\n<p>The history of Lety was recovered from obscurity in <em>Black Silence, </em>a controversial 1998 book by Paul Polansky, an American author researching the Czech Roma. Polansky told me over the phone that in 1939, just weeks before the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia, the country\u2019s government decided to build a labour camp in the quiet southern Bohemian village of Lety u P\u00edsku. When the original population of inmates\u2014local, white-collar Jewish people\u2014proved to be inefficient manual labourers, they were replaced by around 1,300 Roma people. After the war, the camp was largely forgotten, as Czechslovakia\u2019s decimated Roma population could not memorialise it. The state subsequently banned nomadic behaviour, dispersed settlements and moved people into state housing blocks. Once again viewing them as ready unskilled labour, it also brought in Roma from Slovakia and forcibly settled communities in areas close to the German border. In 1973, the Czech government transferred the land to a local agriculture firm, AGPI, which installed a pig farm on the property.</p>\n<p>\u201cAround 300 Czech Roma survived World War II,\u201d Polansky told me. \u201cAnd only 100 were left by the mid 1990s.\u201d In the 1990s, Polansky began gathering as many interviews from the Roma as he could, collecting over 400 oral histories. Eventually, he uncovered documents from a regional library in Bohemia as well as testimonies from elderly people in and around the village of Lety, which indicated that the camp was a fully Czech operation. In 1995, the Czech government erected a memorial to Lety next to the former camp, and held an inaugural memorial service attended by the president at the time, V\u00e1clav Havel.</p>\n<p>Human-rights groups such as Konexe and the European Grassroots Anti-Racism Movement, or EGAM, have mobilised around the image of the pig farm. After years of pressure, in October 2017 the Czech government agreed to pay AGPI 17.5 million euros to purchase the pig farm, and to replace it with a memorial to the victims. \u201cThe construction of a dignified memorial will have an impact for all Roma in the Czech Republic,\u201d Benjamin Abtan, the president of EGAM, told me. His group is planning to cooperate with the Museum of Romani Culture in Brno to make the site \u201ca place of dignity and transmission.\u201d</p>\n<p>There are those, however, who refute the idea of a single Roma identity. In his writings, Slawomir Kapralski\u2014a professor at the University of Krak\u00f3w\u2014suggests one possible path to the creation of a common identity. Kapralski argues that it is through memorialising the shared history of suffering and persecution, with the Holocaust as ground zero, that the Roma identity might be preserved. Polansky went as far as to say that academic projects to construct a unified Roma identity are \u201cpure hogwash.\u201d He alluded to the 1995 ceremony for the memorial in Lety, and told me that he and other organisers had invited Roma people, who had refused to participate because, as a Slovakian man told him, \u201cthey\u201d\u2014referring to the Roma in Lety\u2014\u201cweren\u2019t our Roma.\u201d</p>\n<p>Polansky added that conditions for Czech Roma are worsening. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very difficult to get Czechs to be in favour of Roma issues,\u201d he said. Over the course of his interviews, he found that nearly every Roma person he spoke with felt that life was better under Communism, and that conditions have declined since 1989.

The peculiar aspect of this image is its setting, a suburban area with a river in the background: an unlikely place to stumble upon a bulky piece of equipment. Despite its incompatibility with the landscape, the loudspeaker\u2019s wires blend in with its surroundings and other objects in the frame, including a discarded plastic bag, plate and twigs.</p>\n<p>The presence of improbable man-made objects in an unassuming, suburban landscape occurs repeatedly in <em>Pik-Nik, </em>Arko Datto\u2019s series of images, which examines picnicking as a cultural practice in regions across eastern India, including Odisha, Jharkhand and West Bengal. Datto, a photographer based out of Kolkata, began work on this series in 2013, alongside an accompanying video piece and a book which will be released later this year. Datto worked simultaneously on a project on various islands in the Sunderbans that are disappearing steadily because of rising sea levels and another project that maps the path of the Ganga across India and Bangladesh, and explores the relationship of residents with the river. His projects have many overlapping concerns, such as environmental degradation and climate change, so much so that he describes one of his images\u2014of policemen standing on the ruins of a nearly submerged colonial fort on the banks of the Ganga\u2014as \u201cthat feeling when your different projects on climate change, the river and picnics all come together in a heady fruition.\u201d</p>\n<p>Datto decided to work on <em>Pik-Nik</em> after a boat ride with his family on the Rupnarayan river in 2010. After returning, he heard that an overcrowded boat with picnickers had capsized close to the site he had just visited. This \u201ctryst with death,\u201d he said, piqued his interest in this phenomenon. Having observed picnickers over the winter months between December and February, Datto said that the sites offer a space for merriment and intimacy; the latter, according to him, is \u201ca possibility generally absent in people\u2019s homes.\u201d He also emphasised the enthusiasm with which the picnickers organise their outings, with families frequently hiring buses and cooks, and transporting vats of chicken to their chosen spots. \u201cYet the most curious detail is, by and far, the extravagant loudspeakers that come with nearly every picnic group,\u201d he said. \u201cTransported in their own hand-drawn carts or mini-vans, separate generators are also brought along to pump up the electricity in the great outdoors. Songs from recent Bengali and Hindi blockbusters blare high above permissible decibels.\u201d The festive spirit notwithstanding, the series makes subtle observations on socio-cultural aspects of public picnics, such as the environmental waste left in their wake or their inherently gendered nature. Datto explained that men and women often picnicked in segregated groups, and he had observed a latent sense of aggression, which sometimes culminated in fights breaking out between inebriated men. \u201cDrunk on whisky and rum, men of all ages brawl, dance their hearts out or pass out, as wives, girlfriends and children watch,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Once the picnickers pick their perfect spot, the space takes on a theatrical atmosphere, transforming into an elaborate set of sorts, with all the props in place\u2014music, food and drink. The pastoral landscape soon begins to bear markers of the gatherings, from seemingly innocuous remnants such as clothes hanging on trees, while their owners presumably take dips in the river, to more serious repercussions such as thundering noise from loudspeakers. The most discomfiting sight, perhaps, is the abundance of plastic and garbage that begins to merge with the surroundings. Datto\u2019s image of the aftermath of a picnic, with plastic plates positioned neatly between cacti, feels like the props of a play have stayed on after the actors have left. \u201cAs the sun sets, the buses pull out, leaving stray dogs and cows to feast on carcasses, peels and leftovers amidst broken bottles and styrofoam plates,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Datto\u2019s way of seeing focusses on the curious and the absurd, a tendency exaggerated by his chosen colour palette, as desaturated scenes of festivities impose a bleak filter suggestive of an impending apocalypse. His style of image-making can be deceptive at first: straight centre-weighted composition, a lack of jarring angles and no hyper-saturation of colour. The images are easily dismissible as banal activities recorded from a distance. However, Datto often makes subtle allusions to gender dynamics, such as the unrestrained body language of mud-caked men sprawled on the ground or the judgment in a man\u2019s gaze as he stares at two people locked in an intimate embrace.</p>\n<p>The surroundings in which Datto\u2019s subjects gather are often less than idyllic\u2014next to burning shrubs along the dry banks of the Subarnekha river, or near Kulpi, by the Ganga, beside brick kilns with smoke billowing out of them. The settings of the images are also telling of class, a characteristic that Datto acknowledged. \u201cThe very well-off or affluent people prefer to go to secluded or gated park type places for their picnics,\u201d he said. \u201cI look at everything else.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Text by Tanvi Mishra.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/photo-essay/picnicking-subculture-eastern-india-arko-datto\">The Great Outdoors</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in\">The Caravan</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/photo-essay/picnicking-subculture-eastern-india-arko-datto/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<image><![CDATA[<img width=\"544\" height=\"435\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/01_The-Great-Outdoors_The-Caravan-magazine_February_2018.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/01_The-Great-Outdoors_The-Caravan-magazine_February_2018.jpg 544w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/01_The-Great-Outdoors_The-Caravan-magazine_February_2018-300x240.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px\" />]]></image>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Out of Focus</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reviews-essays/what-raghubir-singh-did-not-see</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reviews-essays/what-raghubir-singh-did-not-see#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2018 08:34:16 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[webmaster]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Reviews and Essays]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Photographer]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[photography]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Raghubir Singh]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[RK Narayan]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[VS Naipaul]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.caravanmagazine.in/?p=35159</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>THE SCENE TAKES PLACE IN RAJASTHAN, sometime in the 1970s.

A photographer passing through the desert comes upon a well. From a distance it appears romantic, the centre of rural life. But up close he finds the well nearly dry, which is a problem for the local peasants, who have no other source of water. They have other problems too, such as finding food. A drought seems to have ruined their annual crop. And their livestock, too expensive to feed, has been sent away. \u201cI have eaten only a bit of gruel today,\u201d a peasant tells the photographer.</p>\n<p>Raghubir Singh recalls this episode in the introduction to his fourth photo-book <em>Rajasthan, India\u2019s Enchanted Land </em>(1981). He offers the following by way of conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In Rajasthan, there are thousands of villages like Galawas, and hundreds of others which are worse off. My aim in writing about the villages is not simply to show its wretchedness. I find it futile to add to the volumes written on the poor in India. But it is important to point out that in spite of their poverty, the peasants of Rajasthan have spun out a wealth of folk culture. Their exuberance, their vitality, their ability to laugh, to sing and dance, interwoven into the rich fabric of their culture, makes them stand out \u2026 Even the clothes they wear, those bright and vivid fabrics, are a symbol of their colorful spirits.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This passage veers away from one kind of local colour, only to embrace another. The argument can be tracked in two movements. Singh first distances himself from a strand of concerned realism\u2014the sort you might associate with the journalist P Sainath\u2014because adding to it would be reductive and futile. His reasoning, one presumes (he does not articulate it), is that such writing reduces people to their abjection. Singh prefers that we celebrate their \u201cvitality.\u201d Peasants, he argues, \u201cstand out\u201d because of the \u201crich fabric of their culture\u201d (and also because of their fabrics). This sounds nice enough until you reverse the equation. Would they not stand out if they did not sing and dance? And would Singh have lost interest if their clothes were plainer?</p>\n<p>His early photographs suggest as much. Consider the peasants in <em>Curious Villagers Outside a Circus, Pushkar</em> (1976), who have their backs turned to us as they peep into a circus tent. This image has a social valence. Singh has registered their exclusion. More subtly, he conveys the imbalance of gender: the women crouch on their haunches, predictably beside the children, while the men and boys stand. But the overall structure emphasises something else.</p>\n<p>The picture frame is neatly divided along the middle: the top half is covered by the tent\u2019s burlap enclosure, which is in turn patterned with illustrations of animals; the bottom features the peasants distributed before a painted fence. The arrangement stresses certain visual resonances: first, that the peasants\u2019 clothing matches the tent design; second, that some of their body language, particularly the crouching, is mimicked by the animals above. It could be argued that this is a visual trope, and a successful one at that. But what sort of success does it represent? Whose vision of \u201cfolk culture\u201d is being reified? Can we imagine a white artist taking this picture at a Native American reservation? Would that not seem condescending? Then again, the peasants\u2019 saris and kurtis (maybe even their white dhotis) are no doubt symbols of their \u201ccolorful spirits.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>THE QUESTION OF COLOUR, </strong>spiritual or otherwise, takes us far into \u201cModernism on the Ganges,\u201d a grand and carefully curated retrospective of Singh\u2019s photos that closed last month at New York\u2019s Met Breuer (The Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s new location). This is first of all an art-historical matter. Singh, who began working in Jaipur in the mid-1960s, is today considered a pioneer of colour photography. This type of distinction, rare enough for an Indian artist, is doubly impressive when put in context. Singh had no mentors and almost no local audience (at least until the 1990s). He did not teach at universities until very late in his life. In short, his Western contemporaries had every advantage over him.</p>\n<p>With tenacity worthy of his Rajput ancestors, he advanced his career from the mid-1970s on. First he made contacts in the art world as and when they passed through India. (It helped that he came from money.) Then he moved abroad, living with his French wife Anne de Henning in Paris, and later, rather nomadically, between New York, London and Delhi, usually with fellow artists.</p>\n<p>His early projects were dictated by the taste of Western magazine editors; few in India would or could publish him. But within a decade, he won the freedom to work on his own terms. Success followed quickly. By the 1980s, he was displaying at respected galleries, even museums, and was admired by the world photo-community, particularly New York\u2019s street photography circle. He shot manically through these years, with an eye toward making photo books, 13 of which he published before his sudden death, at the age of 56, in 1999. A fourteenth was released posthumously.</p>\n<p>Singh died soon after a major exhibition of his, titled \u201cRiver of Color,\u201d opened at the Art Institute of Chicago. His star has waned somewhat since, and the present show, the first on this scale in two decades, is angled as a sort of corrective. It has been largely successful in this regard; \u201cModernism\u201d was rapturously reviewed in the US press.</p>\n<p>There is also a sense that Singh is being canonised in India. The Indian novelists and art critics who wrote the catalogue essays for the exhibition are certainly in no doubt about his stature. Photographers, including his friend Ram Rahman and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s Ketaki Seth and Sooni Taraporevala, paid homage at recent symposiums. The Reliance Foundation was kind enough to fund the show, which ran smoothly until the New York-based artist Jaishri Abichandani alleged, on the radio station WNYC, that Singh sexually abused her in the 1990s. The South Asian Women\u2019s Creative Collective, which she is a part of, staged a silent protest-performance outside the museum in early December. \u201cI have a very simple goal,\u201d Abichandani told the Huffington Post, \u201cwhich is that when you Google Raghubir, this will come up.\u201d (The MET supported Abichandani\u2019s right to protest.)</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT DOES IT MEAN </strong>to be a pioneer of colour photography? Most saliently, it means to go against the grain. \u201cWhen Singh began taking pictures in the mid-1960s,\u201d the curator Mia Fineman writes in the catalogue, \u201cblack-and-white film was firmly established as the preferred idiom of art photography.\u201d That judgment was upheld in several budding traditions. Consider \u201cNew Documents,\u201d a legendary 1967 exhibition at New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art. The show brought together the work of three pioneering American photographers: Gary Winnogrand, who shot dynamic photos of street life; Lee Friedlander, whose work was more austerely self-reflexive; and Diane Arbus, who explored a form of gothic portraiture. All three shot in monochrome, as did most serious photojournalists. The medium held twin attractions: it was more direct and incontestable; yet the two-tone limitation allowed for expression.</p>\n<p>Singh\u2019s great achievement, or so the story goes, is that he resisted this dogma from day one. He instinctually shot his first photos in colour, and never switched, finding black and white too austere. The choice brought him much ridicule early on, especially from American colleagues. But over time they came to appreciate what he was doing. Today, colour is precisely what Singh is most lauded for, though the praise can often seem</p>\n<p>Singh shot almost exclusively in India. Latching onto this, several critics have argued\u2014and new critics continue to argue\u2014that his subject matter merits a special format. Their essential claim is that colour suits India because\u2026 well, because India is colourful. For obvious reasons, this tends to be the foreign line. Thus the conceptual artist John Baldessari, whom Fineman quotes in the catalogue, has praised Singh for tackling India\u2019s \u201cvisual bombardment and overload \u2026 the punctuation of color made vivid by its being surrounded by drabness.\u201d Indians are not averse to the idea either, though their reasoning is usually more roundabout. \u201cOne singular quality of his photographs,\u201d the art historian Partha Mitter argues in his catalogue essay, \u201cis the balance of intensity and saturation in the range of colors that adds essential drama and texture to the bustling humanity in his images.\u201d (Meaning that the \u201cbustling humanity\u201d must be brought to life with colour? Or just that colour compliments, as Mitter claims later, \u201cthe sheer picturesque quality\u201d of India?)</p>\n<p>The novelist Amit Chaudhuri takes the opposite stance in his catalogue essay. Colour, he argues, allowed Singh to a turn awayfrom subject matter and representation more broadly. His real subject was joy. Chaudhuri sees this as a characteristically Indian response. \u201cTragedy, calamity, conflict, loss\u2014these constitute a story or theme,\u201d he writes, whereas \u201cJoy and its smaller secular cousin, happiness, are not, according to Western aesthetic parameters, subjects.\u201d As an aesthetic argument, this does not hold water; much writing about childhood, a major theme in western literature, is about joy. But the flawed logic is of interest in that it reflects another prevailing idea: that Singh captured un-didactic \u201cslices of life,\u201d and that this turn away from narrative is innately praiseworthy.</p>\n<p>It is telling that neither theory addresses the social valence of Singh\u2019s project. That would entail dealing with class, both the representation of class, and the class-privilege innate in the turn away from representation.</p>\n<p>Singh\u2019s images suggest that he struggled to engage emotionally with his subjects (of course there are exceptions), who were ordinary Indians from a wide spectrum of class and caste backgrounds. This is perfectly understandable. As a semi-royal Rajput pursuing an elite art form, it would have been disingenuous for him to act like one of the gang (at the time, there were heavy import duties on cameras and film, and access to equipment was a rare privilege). The strange thing is that Singh never addressed this fundamental issue. Instead, with striking nonchalance, he depicted tableaus ranging from day-to-day street life to popular religious processions to extreme poverty, always finding something of visual interest, usually something to do with colour, incidental to the human drama at hand. As a result, his images have a sort of split personality. Their captions read like social tags\u2014<em>A Tribesman, Gujarat-Madhya Pradesh Border</em>; <em>Slum Dweller; Dharavi</em>; <em>Holi Revellers, Jodhpur\u2014</em>while the pictures are anything but individual or group portraits.</p>\n<p>Consider <em>Employees, Morvi Palace Gujarat </em>(1982). Set, it seems, in the large living room of the palace, it depicts two servants, squatting on their haunches and scrubbing the floor. The picture is framed with an eye to pattern and historical irony. The gaudy and shiny modern cabinets contrast against elegantly patterned tiles, just as one servant\u2019s sari is garishly modern and the other is somberly traditional. As in the Pushkar scene, Singh also deploys his favourite human-object trope. Four circles have been etched on to the glass doors of the cabinets in the middle of the room, a series which neatly continues onto one servant\u2019s sari.</p>\n<p>It can be said that this is a non-didactic \u201cslice of life\u201d that revels in the play of colour. Neither observation negates the simple and overwhelming fact that these women\u2019s perspectives have been disregarded. Again, a simple comparison with the United States is instructive. Can we imagine a white artist taking such a photograph of black maids\u2014and being lauded for it?</p>\n<p><em>Pilgrims on Trichy Hill</em> (1996), thankfully not included in the show, lays out the matter more starkly. The pleasing, blurred background of this image depicts rolling hills that speak to tourist fantasies. But blocking the view, lit by a harsh flash, is a family of barefoot pilgrims. This picture is less a portrait than an impasse. Singh has made little effort to tease out the pilgrims\u2019 state of mind, or even put them at ease. Their features have been recorded, not observed. Police mug shots are more tender.</p>\n<p>There are several similar images on display at the museum, and countless others in Singh\u2019s photo books (those are usually more formally sophisticated). Together, they comprise a sort of mythopoetic version of India: a country of patterns and landscapes and colours and tropes, but very little human personality, or rather, with many humans whose personalities have been muted.</p>\n<p>This muting is what critics variously interpret as a turn away from representation, or celebration of India\u2019s colour. The matter is really more simple. Singh came of age at a difficult moment in Indian history. By the 1960s, the hopes sparked by Independence had given way to a sense of crisis, or rather a feeling that the country\u2014with colonial levels of inequity, mired by corruption, and still largely casteist in its outlook\u2014was drifting from crisis to crisis. VS Naipaul captured this period in <em>India: A Wounded Civilization</em> (1976).</p>\n<p>In the book\u2019s third section, which broadly focusses on culture, Naipaul diagnoses a peculiar neurosis among the country\u2019s middle-class artists and intellectuals; they had grown obsessed with half-baked notions of Indian culture and antiquity. Naipaul correctly felt that this was a coping mechanism. As a cultural abstraction, India was marvellous and comforting, whereas the country\u2019s social reality was overwhelming and wretched. By fixating on the country\u2019s past, then, the artists and intellectuals could ignore the challenge of developing empathy for people outsidetheir class and caste.</p>\n<p>Such cultural myths deform the artistic imagination. You cannot describe a society when you only see a tiny part of it. RK Narayan\u2014who later wrote an admiring introduction to Singh\u2019s photo book <em>Tamil Nadu </em>(1996)\u2014is a good example. In a telling passage, Naipaul discusses reading Narayan\u2019s comic novel <em>Mr. Sampath</em> before and during his visit to India. The book is about a journalist, who, failing to bring about change through his newspaper, rejects political engagement for a sort of enlightened pseudo-Hindu passiveness.</p>\n<p>The story, charming when read in England, felt terribly escapist in local conditions. In India, Naipaul saw that the journalist\u2019s inner retreat was not, or not only, silly, but a reflection of Narayan\u2019s own temperament and belief. \u201cBut India will go on,\u201d Narayan once told Naipaul, a phrase the latter returns to again and again in his book.</p>\n<p>Narayan\u2019s logic was that India eternally renews itself after defeats and destruction; in this cosmic scheme, the individual has a minor role to play and is, in fact, absolved of all responsibility. Singh, who belonged to a younger generation, did not entirely reject change. And in his later work, especially his books <em>Calcutta: The Home and The Street</em> (1988) and <em>Bombay: Gateway of India</em> (1994), he even acutely registers transformations: such as the rise of Dalit political organising and globalisation. However, he never managed to develop a genuine interest in individuals outside his social class. Up until his death, he imagined his countrymen as a backdrop for cultural ideas.</p>\n<p>Sometimes they were equated with colour, as when he claimed, in an introduction to his photobook <em>River of Color</em> (1998), that \u201cThe fundamental condition of India is the cycle of rebirth, in which color is not just an essential element but also a deep inner source, reaching into the subcontinent\u2019s long and rich past.\u201d At other times, his thinking took on an animistic dimension. For example, in a 1989 essay, he wrote that his overarching ambition was to chart \u201cthe geographical culture of India: an environment in which people, animals, religion, tradition, myth, manners, history and climate are inseparable from one another and from the vast land of rivers, mountains, plains and plateaus.\u201d</p>\n<p>The governing logic of his oeuvre should be understood in this context. Singh charted India region by region. His champions argue that he created a \u201cpersonal\u201d vision of his country. But the diorama-like titles\u2014<em>Kashmir: Garden of the Himalayas</em>, <em>Kerala: The Spice Coast of India</em>\u2014are the surest giveaway.</p>\n<p>If he were simply an orientalist, Singh would be of little interest. The thing is that he was, or at any rate became, an artist of remarkable skill. There are countless images that you can commend for the manipulation of perspective, latitudinal tension, gestural choreography or melodies of colour. But Singh\u2019s overall vision remained retrograde. He continued to shoot offensive portraits and postcard tableaus and play silly games with colour, even as his technical abilities improved. That lopsided development is finally damning.</p>\n<p><strong>RAGHUBIR SINGH WAS BORN IN 1942 </strong>into a semi-aristocratic family in Jaipur. His father, a Thakur, inherited land around the city; his mother was a devout Hindu housewife. They lived in a large haveli, poring over their ancestry, enjoying feasts and festivals. It was a cloistered childhood, to say the least. \u201cWe began cycling to school when I was in my early teens,\u201d Singh wrote, \u201cThere, for the first time, I came into contact with the outside worlds, and made friends with schoolmates of other communities.\u201d</p>\n<p>The family kept alive a rich sense of the past. Singh\u2019s father, for example, claimed to own a knife that once belonged to Akbar. His mother, more ludicrously, traced their ancestors back to Rama. \u201cThe martial trappings,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe ceremonies, and the stories my father and mother told me provided us with a treasure around which we built our childhood games. In our fantasies we believed ourselves to be part of a fairy-tale world of fearless warriors on galloping horses and battling elephants.\u201d</p>\n<p>Agrarian land reform brought an end to their lavish lifestyle. Singh\u2019s joint family broke up, lost much of its wealth, and he followed his brother to work as a tea-plantation manager in West Bengal. When his job applications were rejected, he switched to photography. Shooting in Calcutta, he immersed himself in the city\u2019s bhadralok intellectual life. Satyajit Ray, who wrote the introduction to <em>Rajasthan</em>, and designed his early book covers, would be a lifelong friend.</p>\n<p>Returning to Jaipur, Singh hustled as a freelancer. By the late 1960s, he had regular commissions from <em>Life, The New York Times Magazine</em>, and <em>National Geographic</em> (the last, his friend Ram Rahman has said, gave him an unlimited supply of Kodachrome slide film, then unavailable in India). These assignments\u2014neatly framed shots of festivals, \u201ctribals,\u201d political rallies, and so forth\u2014were simple enough. In his own work, he faced the harder challenge of finding a personal voice.</p>\n<p>Initially, like most postcolonial artists, Singh worked after Western models, such as Cartier-Bresson (whom he met in Jaipur) and Eugene Atget. That said, the influence of <em>National Geographic </em>remained overriding<em>. </em>Singh\u2019s early books on Calcutta (1974), the Ganga (1975), the Kumbh Mela (1980) and, one could argue, Rajasthan (1981), are largely filled with expository shots on familiar themes: decaying mansions in Calcutta, the Indian peasantry, religious processions, and political rallies. His sense of visual harmony, and talent for making unlikely contrasts work, are evident in some of the images, such as <em>A Marwari Wedding Reception in South Calcutta\u2019s Singhi Park </em>(ca. 1972), with its screaming pink sofas that nicely sit against a green lawn (there is a rare touch of satire here too). But by and large, the work is unremarkable.</p>\n<p>Two important things occurred during this period, or rather, two events were set in motion, though it took a while for their effects to be felt. First, Singh was commissioned by the great American art historian Stuart Carey Welch to shoot images of paintings in Jaipur\u2019s royal archives. This was a profound experience, unsurprisingly, for a man with his feeling for the past. He fell in love with Rajput court painting. Indian art in general became a life-long passion; Singh later turned to it to explain his own theories about the pictorial depiction of social life.</p>\n<p>If this discovery led him inwards and backward (not in the pejorative sense), the next would take him outwards and forward. In 1969, Singh met William Gedney, a Brooklyn-based photographer who was then in Benares on a Fulbright fellowship. The two became fast friends. Around this time, Singh began travelling abroad for work, and soon, through Gedney, he broke into New York\u2019s modernist street-photography circle, then at the very forefront of the medium\u2019s stylistic innovations.</p>\n<p>Critics unanimously agree that these events changed Singh\u2019s work, though their reasoning tends to be quite shallow. Rahman has made the case most eloquently. In a lecture delivered at the Delhi Photo Festival in 2013, Rahman contrasted Singh\u2019s images from the 1970s with those from the late 1980s and 1990s, noting the startling change in the style of composition. The earlier photos are expository and neatly laid out, conceived above all to convey information and depict a scene. But Singh\u2019s encounter with American modernism changed all this. Photographers such as Friedlander had taken up a more self-conscious, almost existentially formal attitude towards image-making: layering images, ruthlessly cutting the frame, sometimes doing away with the idea of \u201csubject\u201d entirely.<br />\nRahman convincingly shows how Singh came to adopt these attitudes. Consider <em>Crawford Market, Bombay, Maharashtra</em> (1993), published in <em>Bombay. </em>Shot\u2014for once\u2014from within the thick of things, the picture shows a band of porters, alternately blurred and in focus, who are drinking tea. From the bottom-left corner a large arm intrudes, carrying a brass pot and pouring tea into a white cup, and from the upper-right border two legs descend to rest on a mango crate. (The anonymous limbs are an homage to Friedlander, who often deployed a similar trope.)</p>\n<p>From experiments with focus and multilayered composition to fragmented form and cut frame, there is so much happening in this photograph. Nevertheless, the image leaves you cold. You cannot shake off the impression that Singh\u2019s shot is somehow unadventurous, fit for the BBC Travel section. This is not a criticism of exotic subject matter (though critics such as Max Kozloff describe the scene as exotic\u2014in praise). It is an issue of human presence, or rather, the lack of it, on the part of the subjects and on the part of the photographer.</p>\n<p>Rahman considers Singh\u2019s interaction with American modernism in purely formal terms. But form and sensibility are inseparable. The great modernist American photographers produced an extraordinarily personal body of work. Winnogrand, for example, savagely roamed New York\u2019s streets and his photographs are practically giddy with the excitement of social observation. Gedney, who cut his teeth shooting the rural poor in Eastern Kentucky, made images of heroic sensuality. Arbus shot double-edged portraits of people on the margins of society: giants, cross dressers, nudists and so forth. And then there is Friedlander, Singh\u2019s \u201cmaster modernist of our time,\u201d whose self-reflexive photographs are suffused with a sense of alienation.</p>\n<p>Singh\u2019s work is disappointingly impersonal by comparison. His image of the Crawford market tea stall is like a stencil of modernism. The composition is refined, but it does not correspond to a new way of looking. His essential attitude towards his subject is no different than what it was in Rajasthan.</p>\n<p>To his credit, Singh admitted as much, or admitted something like it. Though he fervently praised modernist photography, he also distanced himself from the tradition. \u201cHowever gifted the Indian photographer might be,\u201d he writes in <em>River of Color</em>:</p>\n<p>However personal and intimate his or her photographs, he or she will find it a quixotic quest to bond oneself to the Eurocentric Western canon of photography, in which the contemporary concepts of morality and guilt push aside the idea of beauty. Beauty, nature, humanism and spirituality are the four cornerstones of the continuous culture of India.</p>\n<p>\u201cMorality\u201d and \u201cguilt,\u201d for Singh, might roughly translate to social engagement and self-awareness. As for \u201cbeauty,\u201d \u201cnature\u201d and the rest\u2014this is simply escapist nonsense. American modernists offered a rounded picture of social life and human possibility. Their work explored desire, shame, fraternity, guilt and loneliness, as well as joy and delight. Singh shied away from this challenge, embracing the rosy abstraction of India\u2019s \u201ccontinuous culture,\u201d like the intellectuals Naipaul described. Photographs, in his conception, should not depict reality or express a complex inner state. They should simply comfort us and convey joy.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen men cannot observe,\u201d Naipaul wrote, \u201cthey don\u2019t have ideas; they have obsessions.\u201d This statement could be a caption to Singh\u2019s career. His failure to meaningfully adapt modernism essentially boils down to fear. To develop an individual voice, you have to go through some introspection. This in turn necessarily involves a social reckoning. Just as you have to figure out the colours you like and dislike, you have to figure out who you are trained to see and who you are trained to look past. As someone at the crosshairs of privilege (wealth; caste; class) and marginalisation (he was a photographer in a country that had no time for photography) the re-evaluation would likely have been tricky and painful for Singh. Then again, it could have led to something new and beautiful.</p>\n<p><strong>SINGH COINED THE PHRASE </strong>\u201cModernism on the Ganges\u201d to describe his mature work, much of which was on display at the Breuer. By the mid 1980s, he was no longer reliant on foreign magazines, and worked independently. The images then are his best work; their limitations cannot be excused.</p>\n<p>Among these images, his signature shot is a version of the tableau, which often features a small to medium-sized group of individuals, arranged in striking formal patterns, in a representative milieu. <em>Morning on Panchganga Ghat, Benares, Uttar Pradesh </em>(1985) is a good example.</p>\n<p>People ascend and descend steps at a ghat. The figures are carefully spread out, almost like the hands of clock, across the image. A smiling woman in conversation, caught in sunlight on the right; an older man, on the far left, heading for a bath; children, facing away from us in the near ground; a turbaned man seated at the top of the steps. It is true that a young boy, neatly posing, stands in the middle, his shadow crisp against the white wall. But he is hardly the photograph\u2019s subject. Looking down, too far to appear pensive, he has been chosen for the maroon dhoti he is wearing\u2014which matches the colour of the shrine beside him\u2014as much as anything else.</p>\n<p><em>Morning</em> bears some resemblance to the work of the American photographer Alex Webb, who also made multi-scene group portraits. But Webb\u2019s images are thrilling precisely because of their polyphonic drama and interplay. <em>Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas</em> (1996), for example, juxtaposes young lovers in the foreground with a silhouette of a father holding his child in the background; there is an internal logic and emotional immediacy here that is absent from Singh\u2019s scene. (Bear in mind that Webb was an outsider in Mexico, where he shot the photo.)</p>\n<p>Granted, there is no religious frenzy in <em>Morning</em>; Singh is not peddling exotic visions of Benares. But neither is he offering a vision of his own. Webb\u2019s human stories call to one another, suggesting a larger conception of society or fate, a conception that, above all, challenges us to think. Singh\u2019s characters merely occupy the same scene.</p>\n<p>There is likewise no question of people pausing and reflecting, or, more generally, of the frame as a space for reflection. A pensive image has to feel subliminally animated by thought; there needs to be a sense of mystery. The photographer has to convince us that people are thinking and, more importantly, make us want to know what they are thinking. Only then will the subjects\u2019 inner lives, withheld from us by the mute image, be a source of aching drama. Webb\u2019s characters are unforgettable, even if we know nothing about them. Singh\u2019s are flat, passive rather than pensive; he was himself uninterested in them.</p>\n<p>Most of the provincial and rural images on display suffer the same weaknesses: Singh has little interest in people, and his style is not interesting.<br />\nSomething different happens in the metropolis. Here he responds to the built environment, reading larger social and historical shifts in objects and monuments. The result is a form of modernist critical analysis. Singh remains emotionally absent, but his mind is set to work. His key (but by no means only) insight, as Chaudhuri persuasively explains, is that globalisation separates a city from its own past. A case in point is <em>Victoria Terminus, Bombay, Maharashtra</em> (1991), which shows the great building in Bombay through a blue fly-net held up by a passing vendor.</p>\n<p>On occasion, Singh used the chaos of modernisation as a sort of formal challenge. Consider <em>Subhas Chandra Bose Statue, Calcutta, West Bengal </em>(1986). The statue, located in the far background, is framed by the pane-less square window of an olive-green open door crookedly hanging in the foreground, which in turn is cut off by an anonymous human hand. A bright white government bus in the middle distance enters (or exits) the frame from the left. Finally, right at the frame\u2019s centre are two legs, belonging to a man, strangely bent over so that his torso is covered by the door.</p>\n<p>For all the differing textures, layers of focus, and forms, the image feels harmoniously composed. The statue far away and the window up close; the white bus on the left and green door on the right; the jutting hand and dangling legs: every locus of interest has a counterpoint. Nor is the sense of calm artificial. Though the statue\u2019s contemporary irrelevance is clearly framed, there is no melodrama over ruin or repugnance towards commerce. The ambiguous jumble of change and stasis has been calmly accepted.</p>\n<p>Social change is a more complex matter and Singh does his best to register it from afar. In this regard, <em>Ganapati Immersion, Chowpatty</em>,<em> Bombay, Maharashtra </em>(1989) can be chalked up as a success. The image, which Singh seems to have been shot while knee-deep in water, shows a mass of people in the sea, some with their clothes coloured pink, standing around a large Ganesh statue. Though you can make out a few people further back in the scene, the water in the foreground blurs most of the individuals, imbuing them with a collective identity. It is a poignant, if convenient, scene; the shabby pink shirts plangently rhyming with Ganesh\u2019s skin.</p>\n<p>This sort of studied blurring will not work up close. But Singh\u2019s diorama logic called for portraits. Consider <em>Slum Dweller, Dharavi</em> (1984). Shot from a slum lane, the camera peers up into the opening of a loft, out of which a man, his face smeared in grime, looks out uncomfortably. Beside him, the legs of a woman extend down a wooden staircase. Her pink sari is visible up to her waist, above which she is covered by the slum\u2019s walls. Beneath the man, an electric-blue metal sheet, largely eroded by rust, makes for a sharp contrast with the pink. To the far left\u2014Singh has a genius for latitudinal arrangement\u2014two garments, yellow and violet, hang to dry. He is plainly taken by the vivid colours, and would like us to join in on the fun. Singh\u2019s aesthetic instinct is shocking in the context. The \u201cslum dweller\u201d has been reduced to an animal caught in headlights.</p>\n<p><em>Pavement Mirror Shop</em> (1991) is the best photo on view. An intricate grid of reflections, it includes three or four street scenes in miniature, and a band of people in the background, seen through a gap in the hanging mirrors. The scene is as \u201cnon-narrative\u201d as any Singh captured. The difference is that, for once, he put himself on the page. In the blurred surface of a mirror, hung near the frame\u2019s upper border, you see his eyes pressed against his camera. He is looking at himself, and the people around him, aware that the two are somehow related. Too bad he stopped looking.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reviews-essays/what-raghubir-singh-did-not-see\">Out of Focus</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in\">The Caravan</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reviews-essays/what-raghubir-singh-did-not-see/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<image><![CDATA[<img width=\"658\" height=\"435\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/01_Out-of-Focus_The-Caravan-magazine_February_2018.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/01_Out-of-Focus_The-Caravan-magazine_February_2018.jpg 658w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/01_Out-of-Focus_The-Caravan-magazine_February_2018-300x198.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px\" />]]></image>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>A Bengali Spy for the British Empire Recalls His Audience With The Thirteenth Dalai Lama</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/bengali-spy-british-empire-recalls-audience-thirteenth-dalai-lama</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/bengali-spy-british-empire-recalls-audience-thirteenth-dalai-lama#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2018 05:25:09 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Arshu John]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Vantage]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Dalai Lama]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[spy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Tibet]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.caravanmagazine.in/?p=35096</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>In the late nineteenth century, the British were keen on exploring Tibet\u2014a land that had shut itself off from outsiders.

The trade routes between India and Tibet were monopolised by Tibetans and the hill tribes of the border regions. The only others who were granted access to these routes were Buddhist monks. As a result, the British began to send spies, selected from among the hill people and disguised as monks, into Tibet. Sarat Chandra Das, born to a middle-class Bengali family in 1849 in Chittagong, in East Bengal (now Bangladesh), was one such spy. </em></p>\n<p><em>Having completed his schooling in Buddhism and learnt fluent Tibetan, Das was more successful in his missions than any other spy, or Pundits, as they were called. He visited Tibet twice\u2014in 1879, for four months, and again in 1881, for 14 months. During his second journey, Das took extensive notes of Tibetan lives and culture, which was first published in 1902 as a book titled, \u201c</em>Journey to Lhasa<em>.\u201d In the following extract from the book, Das recalls visiting Lhasa for an audience with Thupten Gyatso, the thirteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet, then a boy of eight years. </em></p>\n<p>In the afternoon I called on the Lhacham, and was sorry to learn that her second son had smallpox. I told her how disappointed I was at not having been able to get even a glimpse of the Kyabgong; the \u201clord protector\u201d of Tibet, the Dalai Lama. \u201cAlas!\u201d I added, \u201cI have not acquired a sufficient moral merit in former existences to be able to see Shenrezig in flesh and blood!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo not be cast down, Pundib la; though it is not an easy matter for even the Shape and nobles of Tibet to see the Dalai lama, I will arrange an audience for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Early the next day a gentleman (<em>ku-dag</em>), who was a Dungkhor of Potala, called on me, and said that the Kusho Lhacham of Phala had arranged with the Donyer chenpo of Potala for an audience for me with the Dalai lama, and that I must get ready as soon as possible. [Dungkhor and donyer are terms for members of the Tibetan middle-class who belong to old families who have contributed in marked degree to the welfare of the country, or possessed great wealth for generations]\n<p>Swallowing breakfast as quickly as possible, I put on my best clothes, and had hardly finished when the Dungkhor Chola Kusho, accompanied by a servant, arrived. Having provided myself with three bundles of incense-sticks and a roll of <em>khatag </em>[scarves], we mounted our ponies and sallied forth. As we crossed the doorway we saw a calf sucking, and several women carrying water. My companions smiled, and Chola Kusho remarked that I was a lucky man, as these were most auspicious signs.</p>\n<p>Arriving at the eastern gateway of Potala, we dismounted and walked through a long hall, on either side of which were rows of prayer-wheels, which every passer-by put in motion. Then, ascending three long flights of stone steps, we left our ponies in care of a bystander\u2014for no one may ride further\u2014and proceeded towards the palace under the guidance of a young monk. We had to climb up five ladders before we reached the ground floor of Phodang marpo, or \u201cthe Red Palace,\u201d thus called from the exterior walls being of a dark red colour. Then we had half a dozen more ladders to climb up, and we found ourselves at the top of Potala (there are nine stories to this building), where we saw a number of monks awaiting an audience. The view from here was beautiful beyond compare: the broad valley of the Kyi chu, in the centre of which stands the great city surrounded by green groves; the gilt spires of the Jo-khang and the other temples of Lhasa, and farther away the great monasteries of Sera and Dabung, behind which rose the dark blue mountains.</p>\n<p>After a while three lamas appeared, and said that the Dalai Lama would presently conduct a memorial service for the benefit of the late Mera Ta lama (great lama of Meru gomba), and that we were allowed to be present at it. Walking very softly, we came to the middle of the reception hall, the roof of which is supported by three rows of pillars, four in each row, and where light is admitted by a skylight. The furniture was that generally seen in lamaseries, but the hangings were of the richest brocades and cloths of gold; the church utensils were of gold, and the frescoing on the walls of exquisite fineness. Behind the throne were beautiful tapestries and satin hangings forming a great <em>gyal-tsan</em>, or canopy. The floor was beautifully smooth and glossy, but the doors and windows, which were painted red, were of the rough description common throughout the country.</p>\n<p>A Donyer approached, who took our presentation <em>khatag</em>, but I held back, at the suggestion of Chola Kusho, the present I had for the Grand Lama; and when I approached him I placed in his lap, much to the surprise of all present, a piece of gold weighing a tola [a unit of mass weighing 11.66 grams]. We then took our seats on rugs, of which there were eight rows; ours were in the third, and about ten feet from the Grand Lama\u2019s throne, and a little to his left.</p>\n<p>The Grand Lama is a child of eight with a bright and fair complexion and rosy cheeks. His eyes are large and penetrating, the shape of his face remarkably Aryan, though somewhat marred by the obliquity of his eyes. The thinness of his person was probably due to the fatigue of the Court ceremonies and to the religious duties and ascetic observance of his estate. A yellow mitre covered his head, and its pendant lappets hid his ears; a yellow mantle draped his person, and he sat cross-legged with joined palms. The throne on which he sat was supported by carved lions, and covered with silk scarves. It was about four-feet high, six-feet long, and four-feet broad. The state officers moved about with becoming gravity: there was the Kuchar Khanpo, with a bowl of holy water (<em>tu</em>), coloured yellow with saffron; the Censor-carrier, with a golden censor with three chains; the Solpon chenpo, with a golden teapot; and other household officials. Two gold lamps, made in the shape of flower vases, burnt on either side of the throne.</p>\n<p>When all had been blessed and taken seats, the Solpon chenpo poured tea in his Holiness\u2019s golden cup, and four assistants served the people present. Then grace was said, beginning with <em>Om</em>, <em>Ah</em>, <em>Hum</em>, thrice repeated, and followed by, \u201cNever losing sight even for a moment of the Three Holies, making reverence ever to the Three Precious Ones. Let the blessing of the Three Konchog be upon us,\u201d etc. Then we silently raised our cups and drank the tea, which was most deliciously perfumed. In this manner we drank three cupfuls, and then put our bowls back in the bosoms of our gowns.</p>\n<p>After this the Solpon chenpo put a golden dish full of rice before the Dalai lama, and he touched it, and then it was divided among those present; then grace was again said, and his Holiness, in a low, indistinct tone, chanted a hymn, which was repeated by the assembled lamas in deep, grave tones. When this was over, a venerable man rose from the first row of seats and made a short address, reciting the many acts of mercy the Dalai lamas had vouchsafed Tibet, at the conclusion of which he presented to his Holiness a number of valuable things; then he made three prostrations and withdrew, followed by all of us.</p>\n<p>As I was leaving, one of the Donyer chenpo\u2019s (or chamberlain) assistants gave me two packets of blessed pills, and another tied a scrap of red silk round my neck\u2014these are the usual return presents the Grand Lama makes to pilgrims.</p>\n<p><em>This is an

The papers have been submitted alongside a report prepared for the additional chief secretary of the home ministry of Maharashtra by Sanjay Barve, the commissioner of Maharashtra\u2019s State Intelligence Department, or SID. Copies of the documents were handed over to petitioners asking for an investigation into Loya\u2019s <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/shocking-details-emerge-in-death-of-judge-presiding-over-sohrabuddin-trial-family-breaks-silence\">mysterious death in Nagpur in 2014</a>.</span> The papers raise further questions about the circumstances of the case, and fail to resolve any of the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/death-of-judge-loya-possible-manipulation-of-records-and-inconsistent-new-testimonies-raise-further-questions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">troubling discrepancies already exposed in the matter</a></span> by <em>The Caravan</em>. They also suggest a concerted bid to manipulate records to create a narrative that Loya died of a natural heart attack.</p>\n<p><strong>STATEMENT ASSERTS THAT ECG MACHINE AT DANDE HOSPITAL WAS NOT WORKING</strong></p>\n<p>The submitted documents include statements from four judges\u2014Shrikant Kulkarni, SM Modak, VC Barde and Roopesh Rathi\u2014who claim to have been with Loya in his last hours. None of these judges had previously spoken or submitted statements on the case. A handwritten statement given to the SID by Rathi, who says he was working in Nagpur in 2014, states that the ECG machine at Dande Hospital was not working when Loya was taken there on the night he died.</p>\n<p>Rathi\u2019s statement says that Dande Hospital \u201cwas on 1st floor and so we all climbed stairs and went there. One assistant doctor was present there. Mr. Loya complained about severe chest pain. His face was sweating &amp; he was continually telling about more chest pain and heart burn. At that time the doctor tried to do his ECG but the nodes of ECG machine were broken. Doctor tried and wasted some time but machine was not working.\u201d In the copy of Rathi\u2019s two-page statement submitted to the Supreme Court, these lines appear at the bottom of the first page. It is evident that the text has been abruptly cut off on this page of the copy produced to the petitioners by the state of Maharashtra.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-35051 size-full\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"1254\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_1.jpg 850w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_1-203x300.jpg 203w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_1-295x435.jpg 295w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Judge Rathi\u2019s statement agrees with what Loya\u2019s sister Dr Anuradha Biyani told <em>The Caravan</em>, as reported in November 2017. Biyani said that, soon after Loya\u2019s death, the judge\u2019s family was informed that no ECG test was performed on him at Dande Hospital because \u201cthe ECG was not working.\u201d</p>\n<p>Subsequently, the <em>Indian Express</em>, in an attempt to discredit the family\u2019s concerns, published the chart of an ECG test purportedly carried out on Loya at Dande Hospital. The time and date on the chart indicated that the ECG test had been carried out on the morning of 30 November 2014, even though Loya died on the night intervening 30 November and 1 December. The <em>Indian Express</em> later quoted the owner of Dande Hospital explaining the discrepancy away as a \u201ctechnical glitch.\u201d The same ECG chart was cited in statements to the media by the commissioner of the Nagpur police, and was reported on by NDTV, which said it \u201cwas shown the ECG report by Nagpur police.\u201d</p>\n<p>In their statements to the SID, Modak and Kulkarni do not mention an ECG test at all. Barde states in passing that the medical officer on duty at Dande Hospital performed an examination on Loya that included an ECG test. The SID report itself makes no mention of any ECG test.</p>\n<p>Rathi\u2019s eye-witness testimony that the ECG \u201cmachine was not working\u201d strengthens the grounds for doubting the authenticity of the ECG chart. If, in fact, no ECG test was performed on Loya at Dande Hospital, questions must be asked as to how a chart purportedly produced by such a test, with the words \u201cDande Hospital\u201d handwritten in its margins, found its way to select media outlets within a week of <em>The Caravan</em> first reporting the Loya family\u2019s suspicions.</p>\n<p>In a follow-up report in December, <em>The Caravan</em> pointed out <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/death-of-judge-loya-possible-manipulation-of-records-and-inconsistent-new-testimonies-raise-further-questions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">signs of possible manipulation</a></span> in numerous records relevant to Loya\u2019s death. It is notable that not a single one of the apparently doctored records pointed out in that report\u2014including the ECG chart, pages of the occupancy register at the guest house where Loya stayed in Nagpur, and a page of his post-mortem\u2014has been included in the 60 pages of documents submitted to the Supreme Court. Loya\u2019s post-mortem is mentioned in an index of all the papers submitted, but only part of the document has actually been produced before the court so far. The first page of the post-mortem is listed as page number 25 of the submission, but this page has been excluded without explanation. <em>The Caravan</em>\u2019s December report included an image of the first page of Loya\u2019s post-mortem, and pointed out that a crucial date on it had been overwritten. According to a Supreme Court order regarding the Loya petitions dated 22 January, when one of the petitioners raised the issue of the missing page in court, a counsel assisting Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi, who are representing the state of Maharashtra in the Loya matter, said that it would be provided \u201cin the course of the day.\u201d <em>The Caravan</em> has not been able to determine whether the petitioners have yet received a copy of the missing page.</p>\n<p>Dande Hospital is the first place Loya is reported to have been taken to on his final night after purportedly complaining of chest pain. From there, he was referred to Nagpur\u2019s Meditrina hospital. Ninad Gawande, the medico-legal consultant at Meditrina, told me on 5 December 2017 that no ECG chart was brought to the hospital with Loya on the night of his death. \u201cI have not seen that ECG. At that moment,\u201d he said. Gawande added that the ECG chart was \u201cbrought over\u201d the next day. \u201cIt was showing changes &#8230; suggestive of myocardial infarction,\u201d he continued. \u201cSuppose if they might be having the previous ECG, I think &#8230; we would also have diagnosed the patient as [having a] myocardial infarction and might be that, we might not have informed the police regarding this thing. Because if the ECG was there. The main scene at that time was, there was no ECG. \u201d I asked Gawande at the time to confirm that the ECG chart from Dande Hospital only came to Meditrina a day after Loya\u2019s death. \u201cI have seen it the next day,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhen it came here I am not sure, because I don\u2019t think the ECG came \u2026 before the declaration of [the death of] the patient, the ECG, I had not seen the ECG. The ECG was not there.\u201d</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"660\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F388947132&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=660&#038;maxheight=990&#038;dnt=1&#038;secret_token=s-51f0F\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_2-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-35069 size-full\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_2-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"1046\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_2-2.jpg 690w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_2-2-198x300.jpg 198w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_2-2-287x435.jpg 287w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Gawande\u2019s signature appears at the bottom of a medico-legal certificate from Meditrina, dated 1 December 2014, submitted to the Supreme Court. This document was prepared on the basis of a death summary, also prepared at Meditrina, which recommended an \u201cMLC and post-mortem for ascertaining cause of death.\u201d The death summary, which has also been submitted to the Supreme Court, states, \u201cPt. [patient] was taken to Dande Hospital. ECG done <strong>\u2013 </strong>s/o tall \u2018T\u2019 on ant. [illegible word] \u2026 While shifting pt. collapsed.\u201d In effect, Gawande, who insisted when I interviewed him that he did not see an ECG chart from Dande Hospital until the day after Loya\u2019s death, appears to have prepared a medico-legal report recommended on the basis of such a chart on the day of the judge\u2019s death.</p>\n<p>This contradiction raises serious questions about the authenticity of the records from Meditrina submitted to the Supreme Court. How was it possible for Meditrina to cite in a record prepared at the time of Loya\u2019s death a document that was not then available at the hospital?</p>\n<p><strong>HOSPITAL BILL FROM MEDITRINA LISTS \u201cNEURO SURGERY\u201d FOR LOYA</strong></p>\n<p>The submitted medical documents from Meditrina are ambiguous about whether Loya was already dead when he was brought to the hospital or whether he was still alive and received treatment. The medico-legal certificate states that he was \u201cbrought dead\u201d to the hospital, but the death summary states, \u201cEmergency medication given, DC shock of 200 [unclear] was given multiple times. \u2026 CPR continued \u2026 patient could not be revived.\u201d Ninad Gawande told me in December that when Loya was brought to Meditrina \u201cjust the terminal [heart] rhythm was there, as soon as he was admitted CPR was started. But at one point you realise that this patient cannot be saved.\u201d</p>\n<p>A \u201cFinal Inpatient Bill Summary\u201d issued by Meditrina under Loya\u2019s name, included in the submission to the Supreme Court, shows a fee of Rs 1,500 charged for \u201cNeuro Surgery.\u201d (Anuradha Biyani said she saw bloodstains on Loya\u2019s neck when his body was delivered to his family. Sarita Mandhane, another of Loya\u2019s sisters, said the same thing in a separate interview with <em>The Caravan</em>.) It is not clear why doctors at Meditrina would have performed neurosurgery on Loya when he was purportedly brought in showing signs of a heart attack.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-35053 size-full\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3543\" height=\"3772\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_3.jpg 3543w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_3-282x300.jpg 282w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_3-409x435.jpg 409w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3543px) 100vw, 3543px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>CONFLICTING DATES AND OTHER UNEXPLAINED DETAILS IN POLICE RECORDS</strong></p>\n<p>The submitted documents include an Accidental Death Report registered at Nagpur\u2019s Sitabuldi police station, which has jurisdiction over Meditrina. In it, Loya\u2019s time and date of death is recorded as 6.15 am on \u201c30/11/2014\u201d\u2014a day before he died. (This is the same discrepancy that appeared on the ECG chart.) Records from Meditrina show that he was declared dead at 6.15 am on \u201c1/12/2014.\u201d</p>\n<p>For reasons that are yet to be made clear, the case file on Loya\u2019s death was transferred from Sitabuldi police station to Sadar police station, which has jurisdiction over the guest house where Loya was staying. A fresh Accidental Death Report prepared at the Sadar station records Loya\u2019s death as having occurred at 6.15am on \u201c01/12/2014\u201d. As per standard procedure, the report from Sadar has to be based on the one from Sitabuldi. There is no indication in the documents as to how and why the dates of death in the two reports disagree.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_4-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-35072 size-full\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_4-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"986\" height=\"1264\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_4-1.jpg 986w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_4-1-234x300.jpg 234w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_4-1-339x435.jpg 339w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px\" /></a></p>\n<p>An inquest <em>panchnama</em> prepared at Sitabuldi station says that \u201cthe relative of the deceased, Dr Prashant Bajrang Rati, recognised the face of the deceased to be that of Brijmohan Harkishan Loya on seeing his face.\u201d A copy of Rathi\u2019s statement to the police, which is attached with the Sadar report, shows him saying Loya is \u201crelative of my uncle.\u201d When I spoke to Prashant Rathi in December, he said \u201cI did not even know Loya <em>saab</em>,\u201d and stated clearly that he had never met the judge and \u201cnever had any contact with him.\u201d In light of this, it is surprising that the police claim that Rathi \u201crecognised the deceased.\u201d</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"660\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F388947111&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=660&#038;maxheight=990&#038;dnt=1&#038;secret_token=s-9Org7\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_6-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-35070 size-full\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_6-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"740\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_6-2.jpg 690w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_6-2-280x300.jpg 280w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_6-2-406x435.jpg 406w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Rathi\u2019s statement makes no mention of Loya being taken to Dande Hospital, and states only that he \u201cwas admitted to Meditrina hospital.\u201d Established procedures require the police to record statements from anyone who was with the deceased in his last hours, yet Rathi\u2019s statement was the only one taken. No statements were taken at the time from any of four judges who claim to have taken Loya to hospital.</p>\n<p><strong>THE RSS CONNECTION</strong></p>\n<p>Loya\u2019s body was sent from Nagpur to his home town of Latur\u2014rather than to Bombay, where he was living at the time\u2014to be received by his family. Anuradha Biyani told <em>The Caravan</em> that a Latur resident named Ishwar Baheti, whom she identified as \u201can RSS worker,\u201d had approached the family to dissuade them from travelling to Nagpur and informed them that the body was on its way to them. Baheti also returned Loya\u2019s mobile phone to the family several days after his death, with call records and messages erased. It has not been made clear how Baheti came to know the details he did, or to possess Loya\u2019s mobile phone.</p>\n<p>In section 3.8 of its report, the SID claims to have dispelled \u201cthe doubts raised in the Caravan report about the role of Mr. Ishwar Baheti.\u201d It says that Baheti was informed of Loya\u2019s death by his \u201celder brother, \u201cDr. Hansraj Govindlal Baheti (r/o Latur),\u201d who \u201cgot a call in the wee hours of 01-12-2014 informing him about Mr. Loya\u2019s health.\u201d</p>\n<p>The crucial question that the SID has ignored is how those who were present at Loya\u2019s death, including the four judges, knew to contact Hansraj Baheti in Latur in order for him to pass on news to the Loya family. <em>The Caravan</em> reported the connections to the RSS of Hansraj Baheti and Dr Pinak Dande, the owner of Dande Hospital, in the follow-up piece in December. While the SID report attempts to dismiss claims that Ishwar Baheti is connected to the RSS, it fails to take note of Hansraj Baheti\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bhaskar.com/news/RAJ-JOD-HMU-MAT-latest-jodhpur-news-052004-177290-NOR.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">evident association with the organisation</span></a>. The SIT report makes no mention of Loya\u2019s phone, or of how it might have come to be handed over to the judge\u2019s family by Ishwar Baheti even though the police should have taken custody of the phone, listed it among Loya\u2019s belongings in the inquest <em>panchnama</em> and returned it to his family without any tampering.</p>\n<p><strong>REASON TO BELIEVE WRITTEN STATEMENTS FROM LOYA FAMILY WERE RECORDED UNDER DURESS</strong></p>\n<p>After <em>The Caravan</em> first reported the Loya family\u2019s suspicions, on 20 and 21 November 2017, the family was incommunicado for over a week. Loya\u2019s father, Harkishan, returned to his home in Latur only on 5 December. On 14 January, Loya\u2019s son, Anuj, appeared at a press conference. He was visibly nervous, and the press conference was heavy-handedly conducted by a lawyer who directed when Anuj could speak and what questions he could answer. When asked whether or not he wanted an investigation into his father\u2019s death, Anuj replied, \u201cI\u2019m no one to decide.\u201d</p>\n<p>The documents submitted to the Supreme Court include signed statements from Anuradha, Harkishan and Anuj. The statements say the family has no suspicions over Loya\u2019s death. All three statements are addressed to Sanjay Barve, the commissioner of the SID, and are dated 27 November 2017\u2014during the period the family was incommunicado. Without knowing the circumstances under which the statements were recorded, there is reason to wonder whether they were given willingly or under duress. It is not clear on what authority Maharashtra\u2019s state intelligence apparatus was brought into this case, or what authority it had to record these statements. At the time of his death, Loya was presiding over a trial regarding the killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh, in which the main person accused was Amit Shah\u2014the current president of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Maharashtra is presently under a BJP government. In these circumstances, the use of the state intelligence apparatus is questionable.</p>\n<p>Sanjay Barve received a letter from the Maharashtra government on 23 November 2017 directing him to conduct a \u201cdiscreet verification\u201d of <em>The Caravan</em>\u2019s reports. That very day, Barve wrote to the chief justice of the Bombay High Court, asking permission to record statements from the judges who were with Loya. The court replied on the same day to allow this. All these letters have been submitted to the Supreme Court. Barve\u2019s completed report is dated 28 November.</p>\n<p>Anuradha and Harkishan\u2019s statements confirm that they had spoken to a journalist, but say that neither was aware of ever being recorded on video. In fact, Niranjan Takle, who broke the story of the family\u2019s suspicions, recorded <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnVzN-kwyaU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">video interviews</a></span> with both of them with their full consent. Neither interview was a sting operation, and watching them it is clear that Anuradha and Harkishan were aware that they were on video. Harkishan appeared on camera, alongside Sarita Mandhane, on 17 November 2017, just three days before <em>The Caravan</em> published its first report on Loya.</p>\n<p>As was stated in Takle\u2019s reports, he was first approached regarding the Loya case by Nupur Biyani, Anuradha\u2019s daughter. This is confirmed by text exchanges between the two starting on 28 September over WhatsApp. Takle asked Nupur to send him images of Loya\u2019s post-mortem, and Nupur asks how she should send the images over. Subsequently, she also sent Takle the images of her mother\u2019s diary entries from the period surrounding Loya\u2019s death, which were cited in his reports.</p>\n<p>Takle\u2019s reporting on Loya\u2019s death stretched over a year, and he spoke multiple times to members of the judge\u2019s family, including Nupur, Anuradha, Harkishan, Sarita and Anuj. Before his reports were published, the family asked him many times when they would come out.</p>\n<p>Just prior to the video-recorded interview with Harkishan and Sarita on 17 November 2017, Anuradha, using WhatsApp with a number under her daughter\u2019s name, sent Takle the address where he should meet them. After the interview, Anuradha texted, \u201cSir interview satisfied,\u201d to which Takle replied, \u201cYes yes\u2026.It was very good.\u201d She responded, \u201cOK sir.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_8-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-35056 size-full\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1520\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_7.jpg 1520w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_7-300x202.jpg 300w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_7-646x435.jpg 646w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1520px) 100vw, 1520px\" /><br />\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-35071 size-full\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_8-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1333\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_8-2.jpg 1333w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_8-2-300x230.jpg 300w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_8-2-566x435.jpg 566w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1333px) 100vw, 1333px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The family\u2019s last interaction with Takle before it went incommunicado was on 21 November 2017, the day after <em>The Caravan</em>\u2019s first report appeared. Anuradha Biyani, using her daughter\u2019s phone, texted Takle to say, \u201cSir I don\u2019t have any problem, but the family at home is panicking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Given this background, it seems the family, under duress, has deliberately chosen to give statements to the SID that can be easily refuted by available evidence.</p>\n<p><strong>UNEXPLAINED LAPSES IN RECORD-KEEPING AT RAVI BHAWAN</strong></p>\n<p>None of the four judges\u2019 statements submitted to the Supreme Court explain why Loya\u2019s name does not appear in the occupancy register of Ravi Bhawan, the guest house where he stayed in Nagpur. This is even though two of the judges who made those statements were staying at Ravi Bhawan on Loya\u2019s final night. The SID report also fails to account for why entries in the register have been manipulated, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/loya-death-lawyer-alleges-register-ravi-bhavan-manipulated\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">as reported</a></span> by <em>The Caravan</em>.</p>\n<p>In copies of pages of the register made available by the Maharashtra government in response to requests under the Right to Information Act, it appears that the occupancy register at the guest house is maintained in such a fashion that even the names of guests with the highest levels of security coverage in the country are entered in it. For example, an entry from March 2015, three months after Loya\u2019s death, shows the name of Amit Shah. Right below this is an entry in the name of an Anil Singh. (<em>The Caravan</em> was unable to ascertain whether this is the same Anil Singh who is an additional solicitor general of India, and is currently representing the Central Bureau of Investigation as it opposes a PIL challenging Shah\u2019s earlier discharge in the Sohrabuddin case.) Such is the care taken to ensure that no guest is left out of the register that there is even an additional entry written into the column for Singh\u2019s entry to accommodate the name of UU Lalit, a justice of the Supreme Court. If such meticulous record-keeping is the norm at Ravi Bhawan, it is difficult to understand why Loya\u2019s name was not entered in the register.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_9-1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-35062 size-full\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_9-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1752\" height=\"1841\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_9-1.jpg 1752w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_9-1-285x300.jpg 285w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SC-Document-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_26-January-2017_9-1-414x435.jpg 414w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1752px) 100vw, 1752px\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/loya-supreme-court-documents-raise-more-questions\">Death of Judge Loya: Government documents placed before Supreme Court raise more questions, deepen the mystery</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in\">The Caravan</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/loya-supreme-court-documents-raise-more-questions/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>15</slash:comments>\n\t<image><![CDATA[<img width=\"917\" height=\"435\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SCDocument-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_26-January-2018.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SCDocument-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_26-January-2018.jpg 917w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SCDocument-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_26-January-2018-300x142.jpg 300w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SCDocument-Questions_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_26-January-2018-700x332.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 917px) 100vw, 917px\" />]]></image>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The Backgrounds of the Loya Petitioners in the Supreme Court Raise Questions About the Legitimacy of Their Petitions</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/backgrounds-loya-petitioners-supreme-court-raise-questions-legitimacy-petitions</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/backgrounds-loya-petitioners-supreme-court-raise-questions-legitimacy-petitions#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 21 Jan 2018 07:10:16 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Arshu John]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Vantage]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Amit Shah]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[BH Loya]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[CBI]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Sohrabuddin]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Supreme Court]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.caravanmagazine.in/?p=35034</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The Supreme Court is presently hearing two petitions seeking a probe into the mysterious death of the judge BH Loya.

At the time of his death, Loya was presiding over the trial in the Sohrabuddin encounter case, in which Amit Shah, now the president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, was the prime accused. The two petitions were filed, respectively, by Tehseen Poonawalla, who claims to be a \u201cpolitical trendsetter\u201d on his Twitter profile, and Bandhuraj Sambhaji Lone, who has been referred to in the media as a journalist from Maharashtra. The backgrounds of the petitioners, and the manner in which the petitions have been listed and heard since they were clubbed together on 12 January, merit close scrutiny.</p>\n<p>While the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-to-hear-on-jan-22-pils-seeking-probe-into-loyas-death/articleshow/62572394.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">media has identified</a></span> Poonawalla as a Congress leader and Lone as a journalist, these labels appear to be of questionable validity. The leaders of the Congress have been forthrightly clear that the party has nothing to do with Poonawala\u2019s petition. \u201cThe Congress party has not filed this petition,\u201d Kapil Sibal, the party leader and Supreme Court lawyer, told me. \u201cI was not consulted and I have nothing to do with it.\u201d Lone did have a career as a journalist, but several of his former editors and colleagues told me that he was no longer working as one, and that he was informally attached to the public-relations office of Ashish Shelar, the head of BJP\u2019s Mumbai unit. \u201cHe is one of those journalists who switch over to the personal staff of politicians,\u201d one of Lone\u2019s former editors, who requested not to be identified, told me. Lone, when contacted, denied this.</p>\n<p>I spoke to three of Lone\u2019s former editors and two of his colleagues, most of whom did not want to be identified. They helped piece together some of the history of the man. Lone worked for around a decade as a reporter for <em>Mahanagar</em>, a Marathi daily, before moving to another daily, <em>Loksatta</em>, where he was given the prestigious assignment of covering the Bombay Municipal Corporation. A former editor and a former colleague of his said that Lone liked to wax eloquent about the ideas of Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Jotirao Phule and BR Ambedkar. \u201cHe fancied himself a revolutionary,\u201d his former colleague said. \u201cBut it was mostly just talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>By around 2010, according to his former editors and colleagues, Lone was out of work, with no money and no prospect of a job. \u201cFor a long time, Lone did not have enough money to buy a beer at the Press Club,\u201d the former colleague said. \u201cI don\u2019t even think he was in Mumbai for a couple of years.\u201d One day in 2015, the former colleague recalled, he spotted Lone sitting in the lobby of Hotel Parle International, a three-star establishment close to the airport. \u201cI went to him and asked what he was doing there. He said that he was waiting for someone.\u201d While the two were catching up, Parag Alavani, a BJP member and serving MLA of the locality approached them. \u201cAre you waiting for him?\u201d the former colleague said he asked Lone. \u201cYes,\u201d Lone replied. Since then, according to his former colleagues and editors, Lone himself has been claiming to work for Shelar.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have seen many journalists who switch over to the other side,\u201d the former colleague said. \u201cBut Bandhuraj is a person who worked with the newspaper of the Peasants and Workers Party\u201d\u2014the daily <em>Krushival</em>, where Lone worked after <em>Loksatta</em>, is run by the PWP, a Marxist political party in Maharashtra. \u201cI mean, even his name, Bandhuraj, is an adopted revolutionary name. It means comrade. And here he was, working with the BJP MLA for this job or that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kumar Ketkar, who was the editor of <em>Loksatta</em> when Lone worked there, told me that Lone has no qualms about his association with the BJP. \u201cHe calls himself close to Ashish Shelar,\u201d Ketkar said. Shelar is the head of the BJP\u2019s Mumbai unit. \u201cNow that does not mean he would be on the payrolls of Shelar\u2019s office, though that might be the case. It simply means that he would be willing to work for him, in whatever capacity, for money, and has done so in the past.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ketkar added,\u00a0 \u201cHe would have himself told you that he works for Ashish Shelar had you asked him about a month ago.\u201d When I called Lone, he denied having ever worked with Shelar\u2019s office. \u201cThe BJP is a fascist force, and I have been fighting fascist forces for all my life and will continue to do so,\u201d he said. Lone conceded that he and Shelar are friends, but insisted their relationship remained one between a journalist and a politician. He added, \u201cI have only worked with the office of Sunil Tatkare\u201d\u2014the Maharashtra state president of the National Congress Party.</p>\n<p>Lone filed his petition before the Supreme Court, seeking a probe into Judge Loya\u2019s death, on 11 January. In the preceding days, the Bombay Lawyers\u2019 Association had <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.livelaw.in/judge-loyas-death-another-pil-filed-bombay-hc-seeking-probe-commission-inquiry-read-petition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">filed a public-interest litigation</a></span> in the Bombay High Court, seeking the constitution of a commission of enquiry headed by a retired Supreme Court judge to investigate Loya\u2019s death. At the time, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court was also <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.livelaw.in/plea-bombay-hc-seeks-probe-deaths-judge-loya-lawyer-khandalkar-read-petition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">hearing another petition</a></span>, filed by a right-to-information activist named Suraj Lolage, seeking an investigation into Loya\u2019s death, and also into the mysterious death of the advocate Shrikant Khandalkar\u2014whose body was found on the premises of the Nagpur district court in late November 2015, two days after he had gone missing. The petition asks for the investigation to be carried out by the police of a state where the neither the BJP nor one of its allies is in power.</p>\n<p>On the day that it was filed, Lone\u2019s petition was mentioned before Chief Justice Dipak Misra, who agreed to hear the matter the very next day\u2014the same day that the Bombay High Court petition was also listed for hearing. In an <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://barandbench.com/judge-loya-death-dushyant-dave/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">article published</a></span> on the legal news website Bar &amp; Bench on 19 January, the senior advocate Dushyant Dave expressed his surprise at the speed with which the case was listed for hearing. He noted that \u201chundreds of Counsel are being declined request for early hearing every week,\u201d And that, \u201cTo top it all, the Chief Justice assigns the case to the Bench presided by Hon\u2019ble Mr. Justice Arun Mishra sitting in Court 10, thus completely overlooking the seriousness of the matter which demanded that it be assigned to the senior most Judges.\u201d</p>\n<p>On 12 January, the Bombay High Court heard the petition pending before it and listed its next hearing on 23 January. Also on 12 January, the Supreme Court heard Lone\u2019s petition, which it clubbed together with Poonawalla\u2019s petition. The same day, four senior judges of the Supreme Court held an unprecedented press conference to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/loya-hearing-supreme-court-chelameswar-judges-speak-out\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">express their dissatisfaction</a></span> with the chief justice allocating specific cases to specific benches. When asked by the media whether the judges had approached Misra regarding the Loya case, Ranjan Gogoi, next in line to be the chief justice, replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>The judges\u2019 press conference forced the news channels that had so far censored the Loya story to finally report it. Speaking to Times Now the following day, Poonawala claimed that Dave had tried to bully him into withdrawing his petition. \u201cDushyant Dave told me that Arun Mishra is Dipak Misra\u2019s henchman and he is not a judge who can be trusted,\u201d Poonawalla told the channel. He said that he refused, and told Dave he \u201chas full faith in the institution.\u201d</p>\n<p>Responding to Poonawala <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://barandbench.com/dushyant-dave-bullied-poonawalla-loya/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">in an interview with Bar &amp; Bench</a></span>, Dave said, \u201cIt is my deep regret that I offered to appear for Mr. Poonawalla pro bono since I felt it was a genuine case.\u201d He noted that he had suggested to Poonawalla that they should \u201cmention the matter before the CJI Dipak Misra to withdraw the matter from Justice Arun Mishra\u2019s bench, to which he declined.\u201d Dave stated that he concluded that \u201cit was a set up,\u201d and \u201ca self-serving petition perhaps at the instance of Amit Shah.\u201d</p>\n<p>During the hearing, in court number ten, Dave appealed to the bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Mohan Shantanagoudar to not take the matter up, but Mishra told Dave that the bench had heard what he had to say and asked him to sit down. Mishra then asked if the standing counsel for the state of Maharashtra was present in the room. Though it was the first day of hearing in the matter and no notice had yet been issued, the counsel was present. In his <a href=\"https://barandbench.com/judge-loya-death-dushyant-dave/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">19 January article</span></a> for Bar &amp; Bench, Dave writes, \u201cIn the Court and outside, many lawyers representing various BJP State Governments were present and so was the Additional Solicitor General of India, who is known to be close to Amit Shah.\u201d Mishra instructed the Maharashtra state counsel to obtain a copy of the medical documents pertaining to Loya\u2019s death, and listed the matter for another hearing on Monday, 15 January.</p>\n<p>It is surprising that Lone and Poonawalla, both petitioners from Mumbai, approached the Supreme Court to file their petitions even while the Bombay Lawyers Association petition is pending before the Bombay High Court. When I spoke to Lone, he said that, unlike the BLA, he was not looking for a judicial enquiry into the matter. \u201cWhat we need is an independent investigation by an investigating agency,\u201d he said. Poonawalla, for his part, told me that he wanted the investigation conducted outside the state of Maharashtra, and that he had approached the Supreme Court a month before the high-court petition was filed.</p>\n<p>According to Poonawalla, his petition \u201cis not about Mr Loya,\u201d But \u201cabout a judge. A judge in himself is an institution.\u201d He said that \u201cthere has to be an investigation in the case that is supervised by the court and that has to be time-bound.\u201d But the record of Poonawalla\u2019s petition, available on the Supreme Court\u2019s website, suggests that he was not in a hurry to have the petition heard until the Loya petition before the Bombay High Court approached a hearing.</p>\n<p>When a petition filed in the Supreme Court presents any technical defects, the court\u2019s registry returns the petition with a list of defects. The record of Poonawalla\u2019s petition reflects that he filed his petition on 12 December, and that the registry returned it two days later listing 13 defects. A revised petition with all these defects removed was only submitted on 11 January\u2014the same day that Lone filed his petition.</p>\n<p>Around a week before Poonawalla filed his petition, his brother Shehzad, who is a leader in the Congress, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-don-t-know-anyone-by-name-of-shehzad-poonawalla-tehseen-disowns-his-own-brother-2564872\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">caused uproar within the party</a></span> on a different matter. Ahead of an internal election for the post of party president, Shehzad publicly stated that the vote was \u201crigged\u201d in favour of Rahul Gandhi. Modi, then campaigning in Gujarat for the upcoming state election, lauded Shehzad for his \u201cbrave\u201d comment. In the aftermath, Tehseen dissociated himself, his wife and his mother from Shehzad, stating that he did not \u201cknow anyone by the name of Shehzad Poonawalla\u201d and that the family was \u201cno longer associated with this gentleman.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the second hearing of the petitions in the Supreme Court, Harish Salve appeared for the state of Maharashtra, with Pallav Sisodia appearing for Lone and Varinder Kumar Sharma for Poonawalla. (Both Salve and Sisodia have represented Amit Shah in the Sohrabuddin case.) Salve submitted to the bench that the state was willing to show the medical documents to the petitioners on the condition that these be kept confidential. It is worth noting that both Lone and Poonawalla approached the court in their capacity as citizens, and neither had any specific locus standi in the matter. It is thus questionable why the petitioners should gain privileged access to such information over other citizens.

At the time, Kanojia and the advocate Jawahar Raja were representing Yusuf. Kanojia waited for about half an hour, during which time the clients of all the other lawyers in the room had arrived. Every 20\u201330 minutes or so, Kanojia said, he would enquire about his client, but the jail official would just shuffle some pages in his register, note down Yusuf\u2019s name again, and ask Kanojia to wait.</p>\n<p>In late October last year, the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/hizbul-mujahideen-chief-syed-salahuddins-son-arrested-in-2011-terror-funding-case-nia-kashmir-pakistan-4904061/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">National Investigative Agency arrested Yusuf</a></span> for his alleged involvement in a case in 2011\u2014according to a chargesheet filed by the NIA at the special court in Delhi, he had received funds \u201cto fuel and fund the secessionist and terrorist activities in J&amp;K.\u201d Before his arrest, Yusuf had been employed with the Jammu and Kashmir government\u2019s department of agriculture. Since 1 November, he had been lodged in a high-security ward at Tihar jail.</p>\n<p>Yusuf finally appeared more than two hours later, Kanojia recalled. He immediately handed over a blood-soaked vest to the lawyer. \u201cSir, <em>yeh lijiye</em>, <em>yeh</em> evidence <em>hai</em>,\u201d Kanojia said Yusuf told him\u2014take this, it\u2019s evidence. When Kanojia asked him what had happened, Yusuf said, \u201cSir<em>, bahut maara hai. Aap yeh </em>please<em> mere parivar walon ko de do, aur </em>Kashmir <em>mein batayen ki aisa ho raha hai mere saath</em>\u201d\u2014They have beaten me a lot. Please give this to my family and tell people in Kashmir that this is happening to me.</p>\n<p>On the night preceding Kanojia\u2019s visit, 18 inmates of the high-security wards, a majority of whom were Kashmiri Muslims, were severely beaten up by the security personnel in charge of these wards\u2014the Tamil Nadu Special Police (TSP) and the Quick Reaction Team (QRT). The day after he spoke to Yusuf, Kanojia filed a petition before the Delhi High Court, which was heard by the bench presided by the acting chief justice Gita Mittal. The bench <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=220512&amp;yr=2017\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">constituted a three-member committee</a></span>\u2014comprising Lorren Bamniyal, an appellate registrar in the high court, Reetesh Singh, a joint registrar, and Harsh Prabhakar, a legal-aid advocate\u2014to visit the jail and investigate the incident.</p>\n<p>Four days later, the committee submitted its report to the court. It did not hesitate to identify and describe the excesses committed by the jail\u2019s security staff during the incident. The committee stated, \u201cThe incident is a gross violation of the fundamental human and other legal rights of prisoners who have been subjected to severe physical torture without any justifiable reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>But the strongly-worded report does not appear to have inspired much confidence among the inmates\u2019 families about the outcome of the case, owing to their previous experiences with investigative agencies such as NIA and Special Cell, as well as the judiciary. Referring to his expectations from Kanojia\u2019s petition, Syed Umar, Yusuf\u2019s brother-in-law, told me, \u201c<em>Hum kuch keh nahi sakte &#8230;</em><em> sara kuch </em>system <em>inka hai</em>\u201d\u2014I can\u2019t say anything &#8230; the entire system is theirs.</p>\n<p>All 18 inmates were lodged in two high-security wards of the jail that were within earshot of each other\u2014Ward C and Ward F. The committee\u2019s report noted that the incident was triggered by the prisoners objecting to the \u201cseizure of pillow cover\u201d by the TSP during a routine search. The report noted that during the seizure, the TSP had thrown three pillows from Ward F into the courtyard outside the ward, including that of an inmate Mohd Hakim, who had specific permission from the jail\u2019s doctor to use a pillow. The inmates began to protest, and these objections, the report notes, \u201cappeared to have enraged the TSP personnel who retaliated by not only beating them blue all over their bodies but also raised an alarm which resulted in the QRT also swinging into action.\u201d After examining the CCTV footage of the two wards where these inmates were lodged, the committee noted that the jail security forces were \u201cbeating the prisoners mercilessly with batons, buckets and everything else that they could lay their hands on.\u201d</p>\n<p>During the inspection, the committee members spoke to several officials and employees of the Tihar jail, the TSP and QRT security staff, and the inmates lodged in the two wards. The committee noted in the report that, according to the inmates, every day for over two weeks before the incident, the jail\u2019s TSP unit, under the charge of sub-inspector Muthu Pandi, had been conducting \u201cvery intensive and aggressive\u201d searches in the wards. The prisoners told the committee that the TSP would \u201cturn around each and everything lying in their cell and virtually ransack their belongings.\u201d</p>\n<p>The committee\u2019s description of the CCTV footage revealed the excessive nature of the security staff\u2019s conduct. According to the footage from the night of 21 November, the search operation began at around 8.35 pm. Outside Ward F, a few prisoners appeared to be arguing with Pandi, and shortly afterwards, they were \u201cseen returning to their Cells \u2026 in a state of panic, probably because the in-charge TSP had directed the sounding of the alarm.\u201d \u201cAt around 9:21 p.m,\u201d the report notes, \u201cthe TSP personnel in large numbers\u201d entered Ward C and began beating the inmates. \u201cThe severe lathi charge \u2026 continued for about 4 mins.\u201d The QRT team then entered the ward \u201cat 9:30 p.m. and immediately they started beating the inmates very severely with batons and at times targeting a selective few.\u201d</p>\n<p>The assault on the inmates of Ward F was carried out in a similar manner. The report states, \u201cAt around 9:26 p.m., the TSP personnel in very large numbers are seen entering Ward \u2018F\u2019 and mercilessly and indiscriminately conducting a lathi charge.\u201d Again, the QRT personnel then entered the ward after the TSP \u201cat 9:34 p.m. and once again beating the prisoners indiscriminately.\u201d Two minutes later, Satbir Yadav, the deputy superintendent of the jail, entered the ward and directed the TSP and QRT personnel to leave.</p>\n<p>The report is unequivocal in stating that the violence during the incident was both one-sided and unjustified. \u201cThe CCTV footage is clear to the effect that there was no resistance or violence or any kind of physical retaliation offered by any of the prisoners either in Ward \u2018C\u2019 or Ward \u2018F\u2019. There is no reason noticeable in the footage or in the version of the prisoners or the TSP staff which could justify the incidence of beatings.\u201d</p>\n<p>News of the incident was first reported by media organisations in Kashmir, a week after it occurred, after one of the inmates, Ahtesham Farooq Malik, appeared before a court in Sopore, in Kashmir, with a bandaged head and an injured arm. According to his father Farooq Malik, Ahtesham had gone to the court to attend a hearing in a 2006 case, in which he was arrested for his alleged involvement with a militant, who was his neighbour in Sopore. Ahtesham\u2019s injuries were particularly grave because, the report notes, he had \u201cactively protested on the account and was consequently targeted by TSP and QRT.\u201d It states that he had fallen unconscious during the incident, and was the only inmate who was taken to a hospital outside the jail. Ahtesham had suffered a fracture in his left hand and a severe injury on his head.</p>\n<p>The inmates in the two wards had suffered serious injuries. According to the report, Dr Rohit Kumar, the medical officer in-charge at the Tihar jail, told the committee members that all 18 injured inmates had \u201cdeep bruises and contusions on their backs, arms and hands.\u201d The report added, \u201cSome injured had deep bruises on their legs and feet also \u2026 Swelling and bleeding from different parts of the body was observed in many cases.\u201d All the inmates except Ahtesham were treated at the jail dispensary.</p>\n<p>I spoke to the families of three inmates\u2014Yusuf, Ahtesham, and Mushtaq Lone\u2014over the phone. All of them expressed a disillusionment with the judicial system. Yusuf\u2019s family had been informed of the assault by Kanojia, but the others said that they came to know about the incident only after Ahtesham was brought to Sopore and it was reported by local media. Ahtesham\u2019s father, Farooq Malik, recalled seeing his son at a police station in Srinagar before he was taken to court: \u201c<em>Jab main isko idhar dekha toh mere hosh hi udgayen</em>\u201d\u2014When I saw him here, I was flabbergasted. He told me that he did not receive a call from the jail authorities about Ahtesham\u2019s condition. \u201c<em>Maine pucha kya hua toh rone lag gaya</em>\u201d\u2014When I asked him what happened, he started crying, Farooq continued. \u201c<em>Haalat uski bahut kharab thi</em>\u201d\u2014 He was in a very bad state.</p>\n<p>Sajjad Ahmad, Mushtaq Lone\u2019s brother, repeated a similar story about how the NIA had arrested Lone in 2014 and taken him to Delhi after giving the family an assurance that he would be released within 20 days. Ahmad said, \u201cAt the time, we did not know about the NIA. We discovered later that this is what they do.\u201d Nobody in Ahmed\u2019s family knew details about the case with regard to which he had been arrested , except that it was taking place in Patiala House court. He added, \u201cSince they took him to Delhi, they have not let him go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Each of the families told me that they were only able to meet their relatives once or twice a month\u2014it takes them at least two days to travel to Delhi from their homes in Kashmir, and the journey is costly. Ahmad said his family could not afford to travel to Delhi to meet Lone. He also expressed his fear that something could again happen to Lone in Tihar. \u201cI am very scared that he will be beaten up,\u201d he said. \u201cHis life is in great danger. Who knows when what can happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>These fears were echoed by other family members as well. Umar, Yusuf\u2019s brother-in-law, recalled his meeting with him, \u201cWhen I went to meet him, he was very depressed.\u201d \u201c<em>Unke zehan mein </em>fear psychosis <em>tha</em>\u201d\u2014Fear psychosis had settled within him, he added. \u201c<em>Jo bhi </em>Kashmiri Muslim outside state<em> hain, unke khilaf toh kuch bhi ho sakta hai</em>\u201d\u2014Whichever Kashmiri Muslim is outside the state, anything can happen to them.</p>\n<p>The prisoners, too, did not appear to be reassured by the committee\u2019s inspection in the jail. The committee\u2019s report stated that the inmates were \u201cliving in a state of fear.\u201d It continued, \u201cThey apprehend that they might be killed on some pretext or the other.\u201d Despite the committee having \u201cextended all possible assurances\u201d to the inmates, the report noted that \u201cthe incident of 21.11.2017 and the severity of the physical assault have left them shaken.\u201d</p>\n<p>The committee rejected the explanations offered by the jail officials about the incident. Their report included several letters that Yadav, the jail\u2019s deputy superintendent, had sent to the various district courts where the injured inmates were under trial, informing them about the incident. Each of the letters, which were almost identical, individually named the prisoner facing trial in that court and stated that they were \u201creluctant to cooperate in the search proceedings, abused the TSP staff \u2026 made incendiary remarks which lead to a mutiny like scenario in High Security Ward.\u201d</p>\n<p>The committee has categorically stated that these reports to the district courts were \u201cwrong and misleading.\u201d The report notes that \u201cnot more than 12\u201314 unarmed prisoners\u201d exited Ward F into the courtyard, and that there were \u201cover 50 TSP personnel armed with fibre batons.\u201d It continues, \u201cIt is a blatant effort by the jail authorities to cover their acts of unilateral aggression against unarmed prisoners.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to an <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/tihar-says-police-teams-involved-in-november-violence-removed-mha-4962379/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>Indian Express</em> report</a></span> published on 1 December, the jail authorities had informed the ministry of home affairs that the TSP personnel had \u201cintervened allegedly after one of their physically disabled officers was assaulted by three inmates.\u201d While the committee\u2019s report observes that Pandi, the TSP in-charge, \u201cis handicapped as he has lost his right hand,\u201d the report has no mention of any such alleged assault by the inmates. Yadav\u2019s reports to the district courts intimating them about the incident did not have these allegations either.</p>\n<p>The report further indicates that Pandi himself did not make these allegations to the committee members. Instead, Pandi stated that the inmates were objecting to the seizure of the pillow covers, and that \u201csince they were all shouting together, he sounded the alarm.\u201d But the committee, after examining the Delhi Jail Manual, which addresses the situations in which the officials should raise an alarm, has also stated that there \u201ccould be no justification for sounding the alarm.\u201d The report states that this \u201cresulted in a second incident of violence on the hapless prisoners.\u201d</p>\n<p>On 23 December, I called Ajay Kashyap, the director general of Tihar jail, for his comments on the committee\u2019s report. Kashyap directed me to speak to the Raj Kumar, the additional inspector general of the jail. But Kumar declined to answer any of my questions and repeatedly said, \u201cI can\u2019t comment on anything since the matter is sub-judice.\u201d</p>\n<p>In its report, the committee also states that Yadav had informed the local police station at Hari Nagar about the incident\u2014though it notes that Yadav did not provide any information about whether the police had registered a first information report against the incident. When I called up Vijendra Singh, the station house officer of the Hari Nagar police station, he said, \u201cI am neither aware of the incident nor do I have the permission and power to talk about it.\u201d I asked him how he did not know about it, considering that the committee\u2019s report states that the jail authorities had informed the police station about the incident. Singh responded, \u201cWhether I know it or I don\u2019t, am I here to explain everything to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>On 27 November, the committee submitted its report before the bench of the chief justice of the Delhi High Court. Upon examining the report, the bench <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=224783&amp;yr=2017\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">passed an order</a></span> noting that the committee \u201chas <em>prima facie</em> observed violation of rules and instructions regarding searches, alarms, and the manner in which prisoners are to be treated.\u201d It also stated that the \u201cfirst and foremost issue\u201d was the treatment of the injured prisoners, and directed a medical examination of the 18 prisoners by a board of three AIIMS doctors. Malik, Ahtesham\u2019s father, told me that this was conducted on 28 and 29 November in accordance with the order.</p>\n<p>The court then observed that \u201cthe matters are extremely serious in nature and require a more serious probe before any intervention should be made by this court.\u201d It set up another three-member fact-finding committee comprising Brijesh Sethi, the district judge of the south-west district; Mrinal Satish, a professor at National Law University Delhi; and Sumeet Verma, an advocate and member of the high court\u2019s Legal Services Committee. The new committee is due to submit its report on the next date of hearing in the case, on 7 February.</p>\n<p>According to Kanojia, the police could register an FIR on the basis of either committee\u2019s report or his petition. Referring to his past experience, Kanojia said that in such cases, the court \u201ccannot directly indict\u201d a police officer. He noted that the police would have to initiate a departmental enquiry against the concerned officers, and that the court could direct an FIR to be registered against them. \u201cUsually in cases like these, the FIR is filed against unknown accused,\u201d Kanojia added. The <em>Indian Express </em>report had noted that the TSP team had been \u201ctemporarily removed\u201d from the jail. However, it does not appear that the TSP or QRT personnel would face a criminal trial anytime soon.</p>\n<p>When I had asked Umar what expectations he had from the court, he said, <em>Kuch nahi, zyada se zyada kuch </em>compensation <em>denge</em>\u201d\u2014Nothing, at the most they will give some compensation. He added, \u201c<em>Yahan par </em>peace talk<em> bhi ho rahen hain, Dineswar Sharma ji aatey hain</em>\u201d\u2014There are peace talks also going on here,\u00a0 Dineshwar Sharma visits here. In late October, the central government <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/who-is/dineshwar-sharma-rajnath-singh-kashmir-dialogue-intelligence-bureau-4903018/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">appointed Sharma</a></span>, a former director of the Intelligence Bureau, as an interlocutor and special representative of the government, as a part of its efforts to initiate a dialogue with the stakeholders in Jammu and Kashmir. Umar continued, \u201c<em>Ek </em>side<em> se </em>talk<em>, ek </em>side<em> se </em>harassment, <em>yeh cheezein ek sath nahi chal sakti</em>\u201d\u2014Talks on one side, harassment on another, these things cannot go hand in hand.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/kashmiri-tihar-inmates-beaten-damning-committee-report\">Despite A Damning Committee Report in Their Favour, The Families of Kashmiri Tihar Inmates Who Were Beaten Up Have No Hope of Justice</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in\">The Caravan</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/kashmiri-tihar-inmates-beaten-damning-committee-report/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<image><![CDATA[<img width=\"626\" height=\"1113\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Kashmir-Tihar_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_12-January-2017.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Kashmir-Tihar_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_12-January-2017.jpg 626w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Kashmir-Tihar_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_12-January-2017-169x300.jpg 169w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Kashmir-Tihar_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_12-January-2017-245x435.jpg 245w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\" />]]></image>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Uncle Shrinivas wants probe in Judge Loya death case, says Anuj may be \u201cunder pressure\u201d</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/uncle-srinivas-wants-probe-judge-loya-death-case-says-anuj-may-pressure</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/uncle-srinivas-wants-probe-judge-loya-death-case-says-anuj-may-pressure#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2018 02:52:31 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Surabhi Kanga]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Vantage]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[BH Loya]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[death]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Loya]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.caravanmagazine.in/?p=35012</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Shrinivas Loya, the 81-year-old paternal uncle of the special CBI judge Brijgopal Harkishan Loya, has said that the judge\u2019s son Anuj Loya is \u201ctoo young\u201d and likely \u201cunder pressure,\u201d after the 21-year-old addressed a press conference in Mumbai on Sunday, 14 January.

My view as a citizen is the inquiry initiated in the Supreme Court has to proceed. This is my personal view as a citizen,\u201d he said, referring to the petition for a probe into Judge Loya\u2019s death, which is scheduled to be heard before a Supreme Court bench headed by the judge Arun Mishra on January 16.</p>\n<p>When asked who could be pressuring the family, Shrinivas said: \u201cHis [Anuj\u2019s] grandfather is now 85 years. His mother is there. The daughter [of Judge Loya], her marriage is there. All this could be there [causing pressures].\u201d</p>\n<p>Shrinivas, who lives in Latur, said he wasn\u2019t aware where Judge Loya\u2019s family is staying at the moment.</p>\n<p>The advocate Balwant Jadhav, a close friend of thelate judge and his former colleague in the legal profession from Latur, told <em>The Caravan</em> he was sure it was political pressure. \u201cI\u2019ve known the entire family for decades. They are now silenced by political pressure to save Amit Shah.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the time of his death, Judge Loya was presiding over the case concering the alleged fake encounter of Sohrabuddin Sheikh, in which the BJP national president Amit Shah, then minister of state for home in Gujarat, was an accused.</p>\n<p>Jadhav added that not only the death of judge, but all the events leading up to the death in December 2014 needed to be looked into thoroughly by a Supreme Court appointed and monitored inquiry. \u201cIt is appalling that the family members, who had doubts about Judge Loya\u2019s death, have fallen silent since the story came out in press,\u201d Jadhav said.</p>\n<p>The advocate also drew attention to the fact that Anuj\u2019s interaction with the media came within a few days of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/loya-hearing-supreme-court-chelameswar-judges-speak-out\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a press conference held in Delhi by four of the senior-most judges of the Supreme Court</a></span>.

On the morning of 12 January, four sitting justices\u2014Jasti Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan B Lokur and Kurian Joseph\u2014approached the CJI to discuss the allocation of the hearing of two petitions concerning the death of the judge BH Loya in 2014, which were due to be heard later that day. The petitions had been allocated to a bench comprising the judges Arun Mishra and Mohan Shantanagouder, who are ranked 10 and 22 in seniority, respectively.</p>\n<p>Following their meeting with the CJI, the judges held a press conference in which they raised concerns regarding the functioning of the court\u2019s roster as well as the CJI\u2019s office. Speaking on behalf of the four judges, Chelameswar <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/loya-hearing-supreme-court-chelameswar-judges-speak-out\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told the media</a></span>: \u201cWe thought we owed a responsibility to the nation. We tried to collectively persuade the chief justice that certain things are not in order and therefore you should take remedial measures \u2026 Unfortunately, our efforts failed.\u201d The judges also released a letter that they had written to the CJI in late 2017, in which they stated that the court\u2019s rules regarding the assignment of cases \u201chave not been strictly adhered to\u201d and asked the CJI to finalise the memorandum of procedure at the earliest.</p>\n<p>In the open letter, the four retired justices echoed the views of the sitting judges, stating that the allocation of benches can\u2019t be done \u201cin an arbitrary manner such that, sensitive and important cases are sent to hand picked benches of junior judges by the Chief Justice.\u201d The former judges, in the letter, also suggested that until a \u201crational, fair and transparent\u201d system of allocation of benches and distribution of cases are put in place, sensitive cases including pending ones should be \u201cdealt with by a Constitution Bench of the 5 senior most judges of this Court.\u201d The judges wrote that only such measures would ensure that \u201cthe power of the chief justice as master of roaster is not being misused to achieve a particular result.\u201d</p>\n<p>The letter has been reproduced below:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>14th January 2018</p>\n<p>Open Letter to the Chief Justice of India</p>\n<p>Dear Chief Justice,</p>\n<p>The four senior puisne Judges of the Supreme Court have brought to light a serious issue regarding the manner of allocation of cases, particularly sensitive cases, to various benches of the Supreme Court. They have expressed a grave concern that cases are not being allocated in a proper manner and are being allocated arbitrarily to particular designated benches, often headed by junior judges, in an arbitrary manner. This is having a very deleterious effect on the administration of justice and the rule of law.</p>\n<p>We agree with the four Judges that though the Chief Justice of India is the master of roster and can designate benches for allocation of work, this does not mean that it can be done in an arbitrary manner such that, sensitive and important cases are sent to hand picked benches of junior judges by the Chief Justice. This issue needs to be resolved and clear rules and norms must be laid down for allocation of benches and distribution of cases, which are rational, fair and transparent. This must be done immediately to restore public confidence in the judiciary and in the Supreme Court. However till that is done, it is important that all sensitive and important cases including pending ones, be dealt with by a Constitution Bench of the 5 senior most Judges of this Court. Only such measures would assure the people that the Supreme Court is functioning in a fair and transparent manner and that the power of the Chief Justice as master of roster is not being misused to achieve a particular result in important and sensitive cases. We therefore urge you to take immediate steps in this regard.</p>\n<p>Signed by:</p>\n<p>Justice P.B. Sawant, (Retd.) former Judge, Supreme Court of India</p>\n<p>Justice A.P.

There are many things which are less than desirable which have happened in the last few months,\u201d Jasti Chelameswar, the senior-most among the four, later said during a press conference. He sat beside the other three judges\u2014Ranjan Gogoi, Kurian Joseph and Madan Lokur. \u201cWe thought we owed a responsibility to the nation. We tried to collectively persuade the chief justice that certain things are not in order and therefore you should take remedial measures,\u201d Chelameswar continued. \u201cUnfortunately, our efforts failed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll four of us are convinced,\u201d he added, \u201cthat unless this institution is preserved and it maintains its equanimity, democracy will not survive in this country.\u201d</p>\n<p>Speaking for the four judges, Chelameshwar made clear that while their differences with the chief justice go back a few months, they had gone to meet him this morning \u201cwith a specific request.\u201d When asked if the request pertained to petitions seeking an independent investigation into the mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of the judge BH Loya in 2014\u2014which were listed to be heard before lunch today\u2014Gogoi, who is expected to be appointed the CJI later this year, answered: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the time of his death, Loya was presiding over the Sohrabuddin encounter case, in which the BJP president Amit Shah was a prime accused. In November 2017, <em>The Caravan</em> reported <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/shocking-details-emerge-in-death-of-judge-presiding-over-sohrabuddin-trial-family-breaks-silence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the shocking claims raised by the family of Judge Loya</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The two petitions, filed by Tehseen Poonawalla, a political commentator, and Banduraj Sambhaji Lone, a journalist based in Maharashtra, respectively,\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tehseenp/status/951666680740003840\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">sought</a> </span>an <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.livelaw.in/judge-loyas-death-journalist-moves-sc-seeking-independent-probe-plea-heard-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">investigation</a></span> into Loya\u2019s death. They were listed to be heard in court number 10, before a bench comprising the judges Arun Mishra and Mohan Shantanagouder. In seniority, the two judges are ranked 10 and 22 respectively among the 25 judges of the Supreme Court. The bench clubbed the petitions and heard them at 11.30 am. The bench asked the counsel for the state of Maharashtra to procure Loya\u2019s post-mortem report, and listed the matter for hearing on 15 January. (Recently, two separate petitions\u00a0seeking an inquiry into Loya&#8217;s death were <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.livelaw.in/judge-loyas-death-another-pil-filed-bombay-hc-seeking-probe-commission-inquiry-read-petition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">filed before the Bombay High Court</a></span> as well.)</p>\n<p>Responding specifically to queries about the meeting with the CJI in the morning, Gogoi said during the press conference that \u201cit was the issue of an assignment of a case.\u201d \u201cSince all our efforts to convince the CJI that an appropriate decision has to be taken failed, we had no other option but to communicate it to the nation,\u201d Chelameshwar said. He added that the four judges \u201cdon\u2019t want another 20 years later some very wise men in the country\u201d to say that \u201cChelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan Lokur and Kurian Joseph sold their souls; they didn\u2019t take care of this institution; they didn\u2019t think of the interest of the nation.\u201d \u201cSo we place it before the people of this country,\u201d Chelameswar said.</p>\n<p>The judges also released a seven-page letter that Chelameswar said they had written to the CJI \u201ca couple of months back.\u201d \u00a0The letter discusses in detail the the chief justice\u2019s role and position in the framework of the Supreme Court. The judges stated in the letter that they were \u201csorry to say that\u201d the court\u2019s rules regarding the assignment of cases \u201chave not been strictly adhered to\u201d and asked the CJI to finalise the memorandum of procedure at the earliest.</p>\n<p>Chelameswar\u2019s estimation suggests that the letter was written around the time of the controversy surrounding the CJI\u2019s decision in a case pertaining to the Medical Council of India. In November, the Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reforms filed a petition in the Supreme Court asking for the constitution of a Special Investigative Team, headed by a former CJI, to investigate a first information report registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation, regarding a corruption scandal emerging out of a medical college in Lucknow.</p>\n<p>The petition stated that on the advice of the Medical Council of India, the health ministry had declined the permissions for the medical college to begin functioning on two different occasions. Both times, two different benches of the Supreme Court had instructed the MCI to reconsider the college\u2019s application. The FIR stated that the managers of the Prasad Education Trust, which was setting up the medical college, were in conversations with several individuals and a retired high court judge, who were allegedly acting as middlemen on behalf of members of the higher judiciary adjudicating the case. Both benches of the Supreme Court included the chief justice Dipak Misra.</p>\n<p>On 8 November, Chelameswar admitted the petition and listed it be to be heard within two days. Later that day, Prashant Bhushan, the counsel for the petitioners, received a call from the Supreme Court registry, informing him that the CJI had moved the matter and placed it before a different bench, of which Chelameswar was not a part\u2014it comprised AK Sikri and Ashok Bhushan.</p>\n<p>The two-judge bench transferred the matter to a constitution bench, led by CJI Misra. Following <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/corruption-allegations-courtroom-drama-the-chief-justices-court\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a disorderly and acrimonious hearing</a></span>, the five-judge bench\u2014which also included the justice Arun Mishra\u2014dismissed the petition. The judgement, pronounced by the CJI, ruled that the chief justice is the master of the court\u2019s roster.</p>\n<p>The four judges addressed the subject of the roster in their letter. \u201cThe convention of recognizing the privilege of the Chief Justice to form the roster and assign cases to difference benches of the Court is a convention devised for a disciplined and efficient transaction of business of the Court but not a recognition of any superior authority, legal or factual of the Chief Justice over his colleagues,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt is too well settled in the jurisprudence of this country that the Chief Justice is only the first amongst the equals \u2013 nothing more or nothing less.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are sorry to say that \u2026 [t]here have been instances where case having far-reaching consequences for the Nation and the institution have been assigned by the Chief Justices of this Court selectively to the benches \u2018of their preference\u2019 without any rational basis for such assignment,\u201d the judges stated.</p>\n<p>At the press conference, a journalist asked Chelameswar what the next step would be, and whether the judges wished for the chief justice to be impeached. He responded: \u201cLet the nation decide.\u201d</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"660\" height=\"371\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7YG-7SsU-wo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/loya-hearing-supreme-court-chelameswar-judges-speak-out\">\u201cUnless This Institution Is Preserved \u2026 Democracy Will Not Survive\u201d: On the Day of the Loya Hearing, Four Senior Judges of the Supreme Court Speak Out</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in\">The Caravan</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/loya-hearing-supreme-court-chelameswar-judges-speak-out/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>3</slash:comments>\n\t<image><![CDATA[<img width=\"653\" height=\"435\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/JudgePressCon_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_12-January-2018.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full wp-post-image\" alt=\"Today morning, four of the senior-most judges of the Supreme Court met with the chief justice, Dipak Misra.

After the shocking murder of the senior journalist Gauri Lankesh this past September, it was clear from the nature and extent of the ensuing protests that this had changed dramatically. During a protest at the Press Club in Delhi, people were practically fighting for the microphone, wanting to be seen to be protesting.</p>\n<p>After hearing Sitaram Yechury, D Raja, Rajdeep Sardesai and Barkha Dutt, I had had enough. When I later expressed my discomfort\u2014given that I had earlier written that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/path-arnab-goswami-cannot-lead-to-barkha-dutt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u201cthe path away from Modi cannot lead us back to the Congress</a></span>\u201d\u2014a friend asked me, \u201cWhere would this <em>neti, neti</em> lead?\u201d It is a fair question, but journalists are diagnosticians\u2014solutions must come from elsewhere. I had then stated, \u201cThe danger of the current liberal consensus is that it seeks to speak against a new establishment without looking within. The compromises and corruption that liberals participated in during the UPA\u2019s rule are what led us to Modi in the first place.\u201d This is even more evident today.</p>\n<p>Modi may no longer command the awe that he did in 2014, and we are seeing the beginnings of an opposition forming around the Congress, but in wishing an end to Modi\u2019s regime, it is necessary to begin with some understanding of why he became prime minister in the first place. Of course, he is a man who has built up a mass appeal, backed by a well-organised publicity machine that he controls and oversees. But it would have amounted to little without the work of two organisations\u2014the Congress and the RSS.</p>\n<p>By 2014, the Congress had become a mockery of what the name represented before the advent of Indira Gandhi. \u00a0Unchallenged within, the Nehru-Gandhis left in the party seemed to have neither the ability nor the appetite for electoral politics. They ran the government by proxy, weakening the already timid image of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Their sporadic and wilful interventions left the impression that no one was really in charge, and cabinet ministers from the party or its allies ran their ministries as businesses pursuing personal enrichment. From the 1980s onwards, no new prominent party leader with mass support emerged. Instead, the party was staffed by lawyers, technocrats and managers who were comfortable in Delhi and nowhere else. Their rise to prominence was not guided by a sense of ethics or principles, and it was only boosted by a starring role in the massacres of the Sikhs in 1984. The party had become a patronage network.</p>\n<p>This corrupt Congress leadership permeated the business and intellectual life of the republic. In the interaction between corporates and the Congress, it was difficult to tell where business ended and politics began. This part has been <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/india/some-telephone-conversations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">well-documented</a></span>, but much the same was true of academics, journalists and civil-society activists. The universities had become places with eminences close to the Congress or the Left (strangely no one seemed uncomfortable with this odd intellectual partnership)\u2014with their best work well in the past. These institutions were busy creating fiefdoms which employed their mediocre students. Espousing ideas that once animated the Congress, the academics were happy <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://thewire.in/27656/not-just-kanhaiya-even-jnu-historians-ruled-out-state-complicity-in-1984-violence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">conflating these ideas</a></span> with the husk that now survived; a confusion that was beneficial to them and the party. In much the same way, many journalists had moulded themselves to this patronage network. As long as they had a patron in the party, their ideological bent mattered little.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the sin least highlighted is the role of civil-society activists. It is impossible to speak of crony capitalism of that time without also addressing the question of crony civil-activism. The industrialists who worked closely with the United Progressive Alliance were good at what they did, but much of what they achieved, for better or worse, came about because of their proximity to power. Much the same can be said of civil-rights activists who worked with the UPA through mechanisms such as the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/india/why-the-nac-is-a-bad-idea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">National Advisory Council</a></span>. Whether they like it or not, such an association does not just work one way\u2014the change they brought in this fashion, sometimes commendable, has also left them tainted by \u00a0their association with a corrupt regime.</p>\n<p>Through this period the political focus was on the BJP, which, headed by ageing politicians such as LK Advani, seemed to lack the ability to take on the Congress. By 2009, it seemed India was living out a paradox\u2014a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://books.google.co.in/books?id=0arKBHOxr08C&amp;pg=PT41&amp;lpg=PT41&amp;dq=CSDS+Among+Indians,+the+level+of+religiosity+has+gone+up+considerably+during+the+last+five+years.+While+30+per+cent+said+they+had+become+more+religious&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HCWI04bMOa&amp;sig=56THKR\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">2007 CSDS survey</a></span> showed that religiosity had increased \u201cconsiderably\u201d over the preceding five years, but this \u00a0did not seem to find an echo in greater support for the political Hinduism or Hindutva of the BJP. At the time, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/india/god-has-left-politics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">it seemed to me</a></span> that the BJP\u2019s failure to harvest souls was a result of\u00a0\u201cthe free play of the God Market [babas and <em>deras</em>] and a fast expanding economy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shortly after, the global downturn in the economy began to be felt in India, but the free play of the god market <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.livemint.com/r/LiveMint/Period2/2017/05/30/Photos/Processed/chart_1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">continued to gain new adherents</a></span>. These adherents were more than happy to buy into a new narrative of grievances that were responsible for their economic woes\u2014the same Congress which they had no problem voting for in 2009, when the economy was booming, had now transformed into a corrupt anti-Hindu formation. Though the Congress had given good grounds for shaping such a narrative on corruption, it is unlikely it would have taken hold if the economic downturn had not occurred.</p>\n<p>Through the period from 2004 to 2009 the RSS continued its steady growth, working quietly on the ground where it did not have political patronage, and overtly in states such as Madhya Pradesh, where it did. The organisation was ready to repeat the template established in states where it had the patronage in the rest of the country when the opportunity became available, as is the case now. Once the global economic downturn hit and the Congress began to implode, the RSS seized its chance.</p>\n<p>Praveen Donthi highlighted this turn of events in his <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/ajit-doval-theory-practice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">profile of Ajit Doval</a></span> in <em>The Caravan</em>\u2019s September 2017 issue. While discussing a two-day seminar on \u201cblack money,\u201d which was organised in April 2011 by the Vivekananda India Foundation\u2014a think tank affiliated with the RSS\u2014Donthi writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The attendees included Doval and Gurumurthy, the god-man Baba Ramdev, the social activist Anna Hazare, the anti-corruption campaigner Arvind Kejriwal, the politician Subramanian Swamy, the retired police officer Kiran Bedi and the RSS\u00a0<em>pracharak</em>\u00a0KN Govindacharya. Soon afterwards, Hazare and Ramdev began much-publicised fasts against corruption, accusing the ruling government of having abetted it. These sparked a massive protest movement that proved disastrous for the government, and provided the BJP, the RSS\u2019s electoral offspring, with a crucial platform for its successful 2014 election campaign.</p></blockquote>\n<p>During this election campaign, while the focus was on the corrupt Congress, the RSS clearly enunciated its aims, evident to those used to the language in which the Sangh expresses itself. The changes in the curriculum, the emphasis on the \u201ccivilizational consciousness of India,\u201d the omission of Jawaharlal Nehru, BR Ambedkar, Bhagat Singh, Maulana Azad from those prominent in the freedom struggle <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/what-bjp-manifesto-doesnt-say\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">were all apparent in the 2014 BJP manifesto</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Today, those who want Modi\u2019s removal ignore the fact that he is a symptom, not a cause. His removal, without confronting the changes the RSS has wrought, means nothing. If he is to lose power at some point\u2014however unlikely it may still seem\u2014to a Congress that seems to have learnt nothing since 2014, we would only be strengthening the RSS and what it represents. The ever-expanding size of Rahul Gandhi\u2019s tilaks during the Gujarat campaign, his inability to speak of the rights of religious minorities (leave alone voice the term \u201cMuslim\u201d), and his failure to articulate an alternate economic vision or face up to its sins of the past indicate that the Congress is already battling on RSS turf. If the alternative to Modi is to be a Congress even further weakened than it was during 2009\u20132014, even less emboldened, it will only give us another round of disenchantment with Congress rule harnessed by an ever-stronger RSS. It would be followed by another BJP government, with a leader perhaps as much to the right of Modi, as Modi was to that of Vajpayee.</p>\n<p>In such an atmosphere, the self-styled liberals\u2014from columnists and academicians to civil-society activists\u2014backing the current version of the Congress or Rahul Gandhi are really not arguing for an end to the dangers Modi represents. They are largely battling for a return of the privileges they lost in 2014, and doing nothing that the RSS would not relish. It would be tragic for the rest of us if this were to happen, perhaps no less tragic than the return of Modi in 2019.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/modi-symptom-not-cause\">Those Who Want Modi\u2019s Removal on Any Terms Ignore the Fact that He Is A Symptom, Not A Cause</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in\">The Caravan</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/modi-symptom-not-cause/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>6</slash:comments>\n\t<image><![CDATA[<img width=\"249\" height=\"435\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Politics_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_07-January-2017.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Politics_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_07-January-2017.jpg 249w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Politics_Vantage_The-Caravan-magazine_07-January-2017-172x300.jpg 172w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px\" />]]></image>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The Curious Case of Republic TV\u2019s Ratings, and the Official Rating Agency\u2019s Blind Eye To It</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/curious-case-republic-tvs-ratings-official-rating-agency-blind-eye</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/curious-case-republic-tvs-ratings-official-rating-agency-blind-eye#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 06 Jan 2018 06:21:36 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Arshu John]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Vantage]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Arnab Goswami]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[BARC]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[media]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Republic TV]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Times Now]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[TV News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.caravanmagazine.in/?p=34963</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Republic TV launched in the first week of May last year, with an expos\u00e9 about the relationship between the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad Yadav and the gangster turned politician Mohammad Shahabuddin.

The channel aired an audio clip of a telephone conversation that allegedly took place between the two while Shahabuddin was in jail. Yadav apparently took instructions from Shahabuddin on how the police should act in cases of violence in Siwan, from where Shahabuddin was elected to parliament four times.</p>\n<p>The next day, Kapil Mishra, a former Aam Aadmi Party leader, claimed on the channel that he saw Satyendra Jain, a cabinet minister in the Delhi government, handing Rs 2 crore in cash to Delhi\u2019s chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal. The day after that, Republic TV broadcast recorded conversations alleging that the body of Sunanda Pushkar, the deceased wife of the Congress politician Shashi Tharoor, was moved from one room to another in the Leela Palace hotel after her mysterious death. Tharoor filed a defamation suit against the channel, and its co-founder and editor-in-chief, the television anchor Arnab Goswami. The Delhi High Court <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.livelaw.in/tharoor-vs-arnab-delhi-hc-says-arnab-republic-tv-right-stories-tharoor-directs-seek-tharoors-version-airing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">did not restrain the channel</a></span> from airing news of Pushkar\u2019s death, but directed it to send advance notice to Tharoor before airing any related story, and to respect his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p>The stories were enough to draw eyeballs\u2014the next week, the ratings-points numbers from the Broadcast Audience Research Council, or BARC\u2014the industry body responsible for television-audience measurement in India\u2014had the channel at top spot in the English-language news category. Republic TV had <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.livemint.com/Consumer/fdz4dbbL3GrE0BCt00B97J/Arnab-Goswamis-Republic-TV-topples-Times-Now-in-debut-week.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">2.11 million impressions</a></span> in its debut week\u201452 percent of the total available in the category. (Each \u201cimpression\u201d is an individual instance of viewing, even if a fleeting one.) In fact, by this metric, the channel had double the audience of its closest competitor\u2014Goswami\u2019s former employer, Times Now.</p>\n<p>But other news channels cried foul, alleging that Republic TV was employing unfair tactics to bump up its ratings. For example, the channel had dual <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://www.newslaundry.com/2017/05/17/what-prompted-nbas-complaint-against-arnab-goswamis-republic-tv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">logical numbers</a></span>, also called LCNs\u2014 it was registered under multiple genres on some cable distribution networks, making it appear more than once in the electronic programme guide, and so giving it more impressions as viewers cycled through channels. For instance, the distributor DEN Networks showed the channel among both its English-language news and Hindi news offerings in Delhi. Some distribution networks set Republic TV as their \u201clanding channel\u201d\u2014the default channel displayed whenever viewers turned on their set-top boxes\u2014which again meant giving it an additional LCN.</p>\n<p>In protest, that month, the News Broadcasters Association\u2014a body of private news and current-affairs channels\u2014wrote to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India to seek an investigation into what they saw as Republic TV\u2019s unfair practices, and asked that BARC withhold publishing any viewership data for the channel until these stopped. When BARC did not heed the request, several leading English-language news channels <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/article/barc-india-ratings-english-news-channels/61290\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">pulled out of the BARC system</a></span>. The news network TV Today also <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/delhi-hc-refuses-to-entertain-tv-today-s-petition-against-republic-tv-117052501092_1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">approached the Delhi High Court</a></span> to object against Republic TV\u2019s \u201cunlawful\u201d and \u201cunethical\u201d practices to boost their ratings. \u201cThe problem with this whole thing is that nobody is clean,\u201d a veteran television anchor told us in November, when we asked him about the channel\u2019s ratings. \u201cThe grouse now is that Arnab does it better than them.\u201d</p>\n<p>The court set the case aside after TRAI\u2019s lawyer told it that investigations were already underway into Republic TV as well as several other channels, including India Today, in response to similar allegations. In early June, the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/english-news-channel-ratings-trais-intervention-leads-to-decline-in-republic-tvs-viewership/articleshow/59100047.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><em>Economic Times </em>reported</a></span> that TRAI had directed cable distributors to prevent channels from appearing on multiple LCNs. The order reportedly led to a decline in Republic TV\u2019s viewership, but the channel continued to receive unprecedented viewership from certain categories of audiences.</p>\n<p>Republic TV\u2019s ratings were astounding not only for the numbers themselves, but also for <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/rajeev-chandrasekhar-mission-secure-power-media-and-politics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">certain unexplained trends</a></span> in its viewership. In the first month of its launch, for example, about half of the channel\u2019s entire traffic came from Chennai\u2014although the channel did no major stories on Tamil Nadu. Even if it had done that, or had carried any content especially interesting to a predominantly Tamil viewership, the resulting traffic should have been spread across the state, and not restricted to just one city.</p>\n<p>One explanation for this could be that Goswami, who anchors the channel\u2019s flagship programming, is an extremely popular anchor in Chennai. But BARC numbers show that when he was at Times Now, Goswami\u2019s average viewership in the city was five minutes per household per day; in the first month that Republic TV was broadcasting, the figure ballooned to 23 minutes. He was off the air for five months between his departure from Times Now and the launch of Republic TV. It is surprising that the long hiatus could have made him nearly five times more popular among viewers who did not watch him much in the first place.</p>\n<p>Republic TV, in keeping with a common industry practice, has partnered with certain regional media companies to facilitate distribution in their respective areas. In Tamil Nadu, Goswami\u2019s channel has <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http://www.exchange4media.com/Digital/Republic-TV-launches-Republicworld.com-with-vertical-videos-VR-and-personalisation-_69590.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">collaborated with Polimer Media</a></span>, which owns Polimer News, a Tamil-language satellite television channel based in Chennai. Polimer Media was founded by PV Kalyanasundaram.</p>\n<p>Kalyanasundaram has a history of alleged manipulation of viewership ratings. In 2015, Polimer Media filed a complaint with the Competition Commission of India against TAM Media Research, the predecessor to BARC, regarding the terms of an agreement between the media company and the former ratings agency. Though the complaint was ultimately dismissed, the commission\u2019s final order in the matter revealed that, in April 2013, TAM had issued a show-cause notice to Kalyanasundaram, then the CEO of Polimer Media. According to the order, TAM stated in the notice that it would be forced to drop Polimer News from its database because Polimer Media had \u201cbreached the security of viewership panel in an attempt to influence the ratings in its favour.\u201d</p>\n<p>The breach was a simple one. TAM\u2019s (and now BARC\u2019s) data-gathering methodology involved monitoring a select few thousand households spread across the country, divided into several demographic categories. The exact locations of these households were meant to be secret. If the location of any of these households were accessed by a network provider, they could bribe the household to tune into particular channels for certain hours during the week. Any money used could always be recovered because of the greater interest from advertisers and the higher advertising rates that accompany higher ratings. According to the commission\u2019s order, TAM \u201chad reasons to believe\u201d that Kalyanasundaram \u201cattempted to influence the viewers by offering them monetary benefits or gold coins.\u201d</p>\n<p>To put Republic TV\u2019s viewership figure in Chennai in perspective, consider that the combined impressions received by every English news channel, from Chennai, in the first 18 weeks of this year (Republic TV launched in week 19), are less than what Goswami managed in his first four weeks. Another odd occurrence in the BARC numbers for Republic TV is that during its first two weeks the channel received 58 percent of the total available impressions across the entire English-language news category between 6 pm and 8 pm\u2014a timeslot when Goswami is not even on the air. A senior anchor at another channel, who requested not to be identified, told us that Republic TV\u2019s ratings in this slot were \u201can unprecedented phenomenon in the history of English news viewership in India.\u201d</p>\n<p>The BARC ratings also indicate that a single household in Gujarat, listed in the category of \u201cMales 61+\u201d, accounts for a disproportionate share of Republic TV\u2019s weekly ratings. From at least as far back as October past year, Rahul Shivshankar, who replaced Goswami as the editor-in-chief at Times Now, has been complaining to Partho Dasgupta, the CEO of BARC, about what he has called \u201cthe Gujarat anomaly.\u201d</p>\n<p>In an email from 5 October, Shivshankar wriote to Dasgupta that the last time they met, Dasgupta \u201cmentioned how Arnab\u2019s hold over the English language market was superior to all others\u201d to explain Republic TV\u2019s towering ratings. Using BARC data for the period between week 34 and week 38 of the year, or mid August and mid September,\u00a0on weekdays between 9pm to 11pm, Shivshankar showed that the prime-time viewerships of Times Now and Republic TV are relatively close across the country, except for in two regions\u2014Bangalore, and cities in Gujarat with a population between 10 to 75 lakh. Republic TV\u2019s advantage in those regions, however, was enough to grant it a generous lead in the overall ratings.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-34974 size-full\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/RepublicRatings_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_06-January-2018_72DPI.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1846\" height=\"877\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/RepublicRatings_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_06-January-2018_72DPI.jpg 1846w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/RepublicRatings_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_06-January-2018_72DPI-300x143.jpg 300w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/RepublicRatings_Vantage_The-Caravan-Magazine_06-January-2018_72DPI-700x333.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1846px) 100vw, 1846px\" /></p>\n<p>In this period, Republic TV led the competition, with 93,000 impressions\u2014more than 40 percent of those registered across the entire English-language news market. But 50,000 of these impressions are from the Bangalore and Gujarat categories. Of the 36,000 total impressions from Gujarat in these five weeks, Republic TV registered 30,000, and of those, Shivshankar wrote to Dasgupta, 26,000 \u201ccome from just one household in the 61+ genre.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe know that in Bengaluru Republic TV employs double LCNS so we understand the jump and we also know you can\u2019t do much about it,\u201d Shivshankar notes. \u201cWe are even willing to live with that. But in Gujarat the spike is inexplicable and defies the genre.\u201d</p>\n<p>Four days later, Shivshankar got a response from Asti Misra, the vice president of business development at BARC. Misra writes, \u201cThe more you slice it down on \u2026 age goup, time band and marker, the higher the relative error.\u201d (BARC\u2019s sample size when it comes to English-language news is already small, given the genre\u2019s relatively small audience in the country, and Shivshankar was whittling it down further in zooming in just on Gujarat.) This implied that within a larger sample the household\u2019s deviation from the norm would fall within acceptable limits. \u00a0Misra suggests that taking a time frame of ten weeks instead of five would show that Republic TV\u2019s relative share of traffic from the Gujarat category had dipped.</p>\n<p>\u201cWorld over statistical analysts always jettison sample data that deviates from the normal,\u201d Shivshankar responded. \u201cThis Gujarat [household] is an atypical viewer any defence of this is to bury or miss the point. The owner of another English news channel called me two days ago pointing out the same thing. Others are beginning to wake up to this fact.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shivshankar continued, \u201cBy your own admission the contribution from Gujarat 10-75L had come down but it still stands at 43% in the latest 3 weeks \u2026 At primetime viewership from just one market and perhaps one House hold!\u201d He added, \u201cThis is making a mockery of the whole BARC system.\u201d In response, Misra objected to Shivshankar\u2019s focus on solely the Gujarat data, and repeated that \u201csuch behaviour is observed for mostly all the channels in niche genre and in English space.\u201d But she categorically refused to reject the data that Shivshankar presented.</p>\n<p>When we reached out to Dasgupta, he offered the same explanation for the \u201cGujarat anomaly\u201d as that in the emails: that when you slice up the viewership data into small segments, the chance of relative errors becomes much higher. Dasgupta refused to discuss specific aspects of the ratings and their anomalous deviations. He told us, \u201cI am not aware of what has been shared with you, by whom, and with what motivation. The emails you refer to could be part of privileged communication between BARC India and one its clients, and if they are indeed part of such communication, I see this as a grave breach of trust.\u201d He added, \u201cTherefore, I don\u2019t think it would be appropriate for me to comment on them specifically.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am aware of the BARC anomaly,\u201d Shivshankar told us when we reached out for comment, confirming the authenticity of the emails. According to Shivshankar, the explanation offered by BARC \u201cwould not fly with any responsible statistician.\u201d He continued, \u201cDeviations need to be capped.

In Jewish tradition, it is believed to hold the remains of the Second Holy Temple. Muslims, who refer to it as the al-Buraq wall, believe that it was where Muhammad tied al-Buraq, the steed on which he rode into heaven. The Western Wall is part of a large compound that houses the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Temple Mount\u2014sacred sites for Muslims and Jews\u2014and is a point of immense territorial conflict between the communities.</p>\n<p>In November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution that proposed the partition of Palestine. The Arab community rejected the plan on the grounds that it denied them self-determination, and, in the weeks that followed, this disagreement caused several clashes between Jewish and Muslim groups. On 4 January 1948, the Wailing Wall was the site of one such battle, as Arabs allegedly attacked Jewish quarters in the vicinity in retaliation after Jews threw grenades at their riflemen. The same day, an explosion at the Arab National Committee headquarters in Jaffa killed at least 15 people. There has been intermittent violence in the area for decades since.</p>\n<p>In December this year, the US President Donald Trump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel sparked international controversy for its blatant disregard of the Arab community\u2019s claim to the city as a capital. The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation dismissed the decision as \u201cnull and void,\u201d and declared East Jerusalem the capital of Palestine. Weeks after Trump\u2019s announcement, a majority vote in the United Nations General Assembly backed the international consensus that Jerusalem\u2019s status could only be determined through a peace deal between Israel and Palestine.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/editors-corner/editors-pick-46\">Editor\u2019s Pick</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in\">The Caravan</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/editors-corner/editors-pick-46/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<image><![CDATA[<img width=\"558\" height=\"435\" src=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Editors-Pick_The-Caravan-Magazine_January_2018.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Editors-Pick_The-Caravan-Magazine_January_2018.jpg 558w, http://www.caravanmagazine.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Editors-Pick_The-Caravan-Magazine_January_2018-300x234.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px\" />]]></image>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The Ranthambore Festival</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/showcase/the-ranthambore-festival</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.caravanmagazine.in/showcase/the-ranthambore-festival#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2018 14:13:13 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[webmaster]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Showcase]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.caravanmagazine.in/?p=34771</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>19 TO 21 JANUARY NAHARGARH PALACE, RANTHAMBORE A year after its debut, the Ranthambore Festival is back with a series of concerts featuring folk and international musicians as well as interactive workshops for music and nature enthusiasts.
