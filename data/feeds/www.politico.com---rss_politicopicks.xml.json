Given the widespread nature of wage theft and the dearth of resources to combat it, most cases go unreported. Thus, an estimated $15 billion in desperately needed income for workers with lowest wages  goes instead into the pockets of shady bosses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even those workers who are able to brave the system and win \u2014 to get states to order their bosses to pay them what they\u2019re owed -- confront a further barrier: Fully 41 percent of the wages that employers are ordered to pay back to their workers aren\u2019t recovered, according to a POLITICO survey of 15 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s partly because, in addition to lacking resources, states lack the tools to go after the landscaping firms, restaurants, cleaning companies and other employers that shed one corporate skin for another, changing names while essentially continuing the same businesses \u2014 often to evade orders to pay back their workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This failure to enforce both the minimum hourly wage \u2014 $7.25 under federal law \u2014 and rules requiring higher pay for overtime distorts the economy, giving advantages to employers who break the law. It allows long-term patterns of abuse to take root in certain service industries, especially restaurants, landscaping and cleaning. Advocates for lowest-wage workers  describe families facing eviction and experiencing hunger for lack of money that\u2019s owed them. And, nationally, the failure to enforce wage laws exacerbates a level of income inequality that, by many measures, is higher than it\u2019s been for the past century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cLow-income workers are already in this fragile balance,\u201d said Victor Narro of the UCLA Labor Center. \u201cOne paycheck of not being able to get the wages they\u2019re owed can cause them to lose everything.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interviews with scores of state officials, legal-services advocates and labor specialists indicate that the failure to enforce minimum wages touches every corner of the country, but is especially acute in the six states that have no investigators probing wage violations at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All six states that have no minimum-wage investigators are in the South, and in a seventh, Florida, former Gov. Jeb Bush eliminated the state Department of Labor over a period of years in the early 2000s. In theory, its responsibilities were distributed among other state agencies, but in practice Florida failed to undertake a single enforcement action for more than four years.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Georgia, Louisiana, Alabama, South Carolina, Tennessee and Mississippi all have labor agencies, but workers can\u2019t file minimum wage or overtime claims with them; they must instead appeal to the U.S. Department of Labor, which takes cases only selectively, based in part on the number of employees involved and the extent of the wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIn Louisiana, it would have a substantial impact on the lives of working families to be able to call someone and say, \u2018My employer hasn\u2019t paid me in three weeks \u2014 what do I do?\u2019 and to have someone who can go in and help you with that,\u2019\u2019 said Andrea Agee, staff attorney at the Workplace Justice Project in New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal Department of Labor, Agee said, isn\u2019t the answer for individual workers, because it only takes cases selectively, and because it, too, lacks resources and is slowed by bureaucracy. \u201cIf you\u2019re someone in need of a check, reporting a wage claim to the DOL is not going to get you your rent in time,\u201d she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal Department of Labor has 894 investigators \u2014 vastly more than any state agency. By historic measures, though, its investigative workforce isn\u2019t particularly large. In 1948, when the United States had 23 million workers, the division had 1,000 investigators. Today, the U.S. has seven times as many workers, but slightly fewer federal wage-and-hour investigators than it had 70 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Labor Department spokesman said, \u201cThe current number of wage-and-hour investigators is well within the average of the past several decades. Note that in fiscal year 2017, [the department] recovered $270 million in back wages \u2014 the second-highest amount ever recovered.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politicians who support higher-wage laws are often passionate about the need for higher pay, making the minimum wage one of the most hard-fought issues of recent years. But they give strikingly little attention to the enforcement of those laws, where they could push to add investigators and institute new laws to make it harder for employers to evade enforcement by changing their corporate identities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked to comment on POLITICO\u2019s findings, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, who helps lead a group of 22 Senate Democrats who support a plan to gradually increase the federal minimum to $15 per hour, and who has pushed his own bill to provide up to $50 million in grants to employers, nonprofits, unions and others who can assist in the enforcement of wage and hour laws,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;expressed concern but quickly pivoted to the larger issue of raising the minimum wage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWages are far too low to begin with, so when money is stolen right out of workers\u2019 paychecks, we have to have effective tools in place to get that money back,\u201d Brown said in a statement. \u201cBut wage theft is just one part of the problem that hard work simply doesn\u2019t pay off the way it should. And that\u2019s true for all workers \u2014 whether they punch a time clock, swipe a badge, make a salary or earns tips \u2014 they\u2019re working too hard for too little.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s little comfort for the workers who fight their way through government bureaucracies and hearings to get their back pay \u2014 only to discover that there\u2019s no way for the government to collect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;\u201c&lt;/b&gt;How would you feel if I robbed you of [thousands of] dollars?\u201d asked Alfonso de la Paz, a construction worker who, according to the state of Illinois, was stiffed on about $3,000 in back pay&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;by a contractor who failed to respond to two notices from the state Department of Labor. \u201cThat\u2019s what he owes me.\u201d&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Battles over the minimum wage are fought along ideological lines, with liberals insisting that higher minimums prevent exploitation and support families who otherwise might need government assistance. Conservatives argue that the labor market should dictate wages, and that states, with their widely varying costs of living, are better positioned than the federal government is to set minimums. The 2016 Republican platform proposed that minimum-wage issues should be handled at the state level, and President Donald Trump, who suggested on the campaign trail that the federal minimum \u201chas to go up,\u201d has largely avoided the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue shows every sign of going to the voters this November. Many Democrats are already stressing the importance of a $15-per-hour \u201cliving wage\u201d as a way to energize lower-income voters. Meanwhile, many states have moved to raise their own hourly minimums far above the federal level \u2014 with Washington, D.C., requiring $12.50, Washington State demanding $11.50 and California clocking in at $11. Many other states exceed the federal minimum. In addition, federal law continues to require that hourly workers receive time-and-a-half for work beyond 40 hours per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But advocates for low-income workers across the country say employers routinely violate these laws, with little fear of getting caught. And even in states with comparatively robust labor departments, enforcement is lax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;\u201c&lt;/b&gt;Wage theft is the rule, not the exception, for low-wage workers,\u201d said Michael Hollander, a staff attorney at Community Legal Services of Philadelphia, using a term that covers all forms of cheating on wages, including violating minimum-wage laws and overtime rules. Pennsylvania has 31 investigators probing wage and hours violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Blum, a staff attorney at the Legal Aid Society in New York, which has 114 wage-theft investigators,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;suggested that employers make a strategic decision to violate wage laws to gain a competitive advantage: \u201cIt is competitively smart to cheat and steal from your workers because the odds of getting caught are low and the odds of having to pay are low.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the six states with no investigators and Florida, which had no enforcement for at least four years, POLITICO\u2019s review found that other states, including Arkansas, Ohio and Hawaii have reduced the number of investigators in recent years.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Of the states that have investigators for minimum wage, 26&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;have fewer than 10, according to surveys conducted between September and February. South Dakota has one, for example, and Indiana has one fulltime and one working part time. Meanwhile, two states \u2014 Kansas and Iowa \u2014 put a monetary ceiling on wage-theft&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;cases they\u2019ll pursue: As a matter of policy, these states decline to pursue enforcement actions if the amount involved is too high. In Kansas, the ceiling is $10,000; in Iowa, $5,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThese agencies are so underfunded,\u201d said Tia Koonse, legal and policy research manager at the UCLA Labor Center, \u201cthat we rely on the honor system for employers to pay the minimum wage.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workers who are shortchanged on minimum wage or overtime pay have three options: They can hire a private attorney; they can file a complaint with the state labor agency, if it enforces wage claims; or they can file a complaint with the federal Labor Department\u2019s Wage and Hour division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal government does a better job than most states in recovering wages: Money changes hands after wage-theft judgments about 90 percent of the time. But that success rate is less impressive when one considers that the Labor Department cherry-picks the cases it takes on, with an eye for those that promise big payouts, and can\u2019t enforce payment of state hourly minimum that exceeds the federal rate of $7.25.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; The federal Labor Department also has more power than many state agencies to impose and collect penalties, reducing employers\u2019 incentives to fight back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with those advantages, the federal Labor Department ends up returning, on average, $16 million annually to the Treasury Department because it\u2019s unable to locate the workers who are owed the back pay. Typically that\u2019s because the claim has taken so long to work its way through the system that the employee has moved and is unreachable.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Low-wage workers tend to be more transient than higher-paid workers, and some are undocumented, which makes them reluctant to keep the government fully abreast of their moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That leaves state Labor Departments as the&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;prime source of on-the-ground enforcement, but as&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;watchdog agencies tasked with enforcing wage laws, their relationships with local businesses are often adversarial, and business groups often lobby state legislatures to cut their funding. The appetite to fund labor-related investigations shrank further during the past decade as the pro-business GOP acquired control of more state capitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Virginia, where Republicans have controlled both houses in recent years, the Legislature didn\u2019t fund its payment-of-wage program for an entire year&lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150913070502/http:/www.doli.virginia.gov/media_room/annual_reports/2012/2012%20DOLI%20Annual%20Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; starting in July 2012. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Government officials working in that division were reassigned, and workers in Virginia had no state office through which to recover stolen wages. One year later, when the Legislature restored funding, the division had to be re-created, and the state had to hire new people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cState labor agencies in the South that enforce wage laws are few and far between,\u201d observes Meredith Stewart, a senior staff attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arkansas is one of the few that does. As recently as 2014, it had 10 investigators dedicated to wage-theft complaints. But today, it has&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;five, one of whom has had to take on administrative work. Meanwhile, a single attorney is left to handle the agency\u2019s wage litigation; to analyze proposed legislation affecting her division; to review her division\u2019s regulations; and to provide legal advice to enforcement staff, the&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;attorney told POLITICO in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lindsay Moore is Arkansas\u2019 labor standards manager and he oversees enforcement of wage and hour laws. Cuts to his division, he said, lengthened wait times for employees who file claims to as long as one year. Sometimes, Moore will advise complainants that they\u2019d be better off hiring a private attorney or taking their cases to the federal Labor Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe simply don\u2019t have the manpower to work on this in an expedient fashion,\u201d said Moore. Often, he said, by the time the labor standards division is ready to take up a case, the worker is \u201cvery frustrated with us\u201d and tells Moore to forget about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even states outside the South often lack the personnel necessary to process and enforce claims in a timely manner, though staffing levels vary widely. Idaho (with a population of 1.7 million) has five wage and hour investigators, of whom only one is tasked with making sure that companies actually pay whatever back wages the state says they owe. Missouri&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;(6.1 million) has three.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Wisconsin (5.8 million) is more protective of workers, with nine wage-and-hour investigators, all of whom collect back pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhen workers cannot collect, it sends the message that such claims are not worth pursuing, that scofflaw employers can profit illegally with impunity, and that the deck is stacked in favor of the relatively rich and powerful,\u201d said Sally Dworkin-Fisher, attorney at the Public Justice Center in Maryland, which has 11 investigators handling wage claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;***&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labor agencies in large, worker-friendly states often boast in news releases about millions recovered in wage-theft enforcement actions. But these same agencies turn reticent when asked what percentage of those wages were successfully extracted from violators and handed over to the wronged workers. That\u2019s because a high percentage of those wages never make it to the state, let alone workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POLITICO\u2019s survey of 15 states with comparable data found that 41 percent of the money assessed against employers who violate wage laws was never recovered. POLITICO compared the total wages assessed to total wages recovered for the 15 states between 2007 and 2017. State figures included many forms of wage theft and enforcement actions depending on what the state reported, including minimum wage, overtime and unpaid wages and benefits. Not all of the states surveyed reported data for each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collection rates varied widely from state to state. Montana recovered $7.9 million of $33.3 million in back pay assessed between 2007 and 2016, just 24 percent. Texas did better, recovering 54 percent of $70.5 million between 2010 and 2016.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Indiana recovered $2.3 million of $3.1 million&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;assessed between 2010 and October 2017. Missouri recovered $1.5 million of $2 million in back pay assessed since 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies in states whose data wasn\u2019t part of POLITICO\u2019s survey suggest that they, too, had widely varying rates of recovery of wage-theft cases, though even the best rates still left more than a third of all money unrecovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York recouped about 64 percent of back pay assessed, according to data collected for a 2015 report by the Urban Justice Center, the Legal Aid Society, and the National Center for Law and Economic Justice. Massachusetts recovered in full on 56.3 percent of citations for wage violations between January 2015 and August 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In California, by contrast, only 17 percent of workers who won wage-theft judgments between 2008 and 2011 received their money, according to a 2013 study by the UCLA Labor Center and the nonprofit National Employment Law Project. Paola LaVerde, a spokesperson for the&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;California Department of Industrial Relations told POLITICO in an email that the state enacted new \u201cenforcement tools\u201d in 2016, but \u201cthere has not been sufficient time to evaluate the impact of those tools.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by its mere willingness to evaluate its success or failure, California is ahead of many states that don\u2019t bother to keep track of how much they recover compared to how much they assess. Of the states that had investigators,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;15 had comparable statistics for assessment and recovery, four compiled their data in different forms, and 24 could not say what their rate of recovery was. Florida, which did not perform any enforcement action from late 2011 through early 2016, according to records obtained by the publication In These Times and reviewed by POLITICO, did not respond to requests for updated information. And neither Jeb Bush, who as governor eliminated the state Labor Department, nor his spokesperson answered emailed requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recovery percentages from all states pale in comparison to the federal Labor Department\u2019s claim that 90 percent of its judgments against employers end with the worker collecting back pay. But some questions have been raised about whether the federal Labor Department\u2019s collection rate is really as high as it claims. In 2009, the Government Accountability Office&lt;a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/130/122107.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; said &lt;/a&gt;that the Bush administration\u2019s Wage and Hour division \u201cinstructed many offices not to record unsuccessful conciliations, making [the division seem] better at resolving conciliations than it actually is.\u201d GAO staffers posed as employees struggling to collect back pay and found some wage-and-hour inspectors recorded that they received it when they didn\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Labor Department determines that an employer owes an employee back pay, the agency can require that the employer pay the employee directly, or it can collect the money from the employer and pay the worker itself. A 2015&lt;a href=\"https://www.oig.dol.gov/public/reports/oa/2015/04-15-001-04-420.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; from the Office of the Inspector General found that when President Barack Obama\u2019s Wage and Hour Division followed this second route, it \u201cdid not make reasonable efforts to locate employees\u201d in about 71 percent of cases, according to a random sample. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Weil, who headed the Wage and Hour department under Obama, said that rebuke has to be viewed in context: Fully 76 percent of back wages are paid directly to workers by their employers, he said, and the amount returned to Treasury represents only 5 percent of the total owed. Weil conceded, however, that Wage and Hour must follow up more aggressively on its wage-and-hour judgments and that it needs to find better ways to locate employees to whom back pay is owed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2015, he said, the Labor Department created an online application in which workers can enter their names and those of their employers to find out if they\u2019re owed back pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;***&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when states and the federal government are able to collect on back pay, the total represents only a fraction of the billions lost each year to wage theft. The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, estimated that annual wage thefts top $15 billion; they extrapolated that figure from a study of the 10 most populous states, accounting for more than half the country\u2019s population. The vast majority of those dollars are never returned to workers, because employers have many tactics to avoid enforcement, including simply closing up shop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the service-industry companies that violate wage-and-hour laws have little in the way of brand identity or fixed costs. Their owners can therefore dissolve the business with comparative ease, transferring all assets to a new business entity that operates under a different name. Once the transfer is complete, there\u2019s usually little a state labor agency can do to punish the owner, because on paper the offending company no longer exists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem can be exacerbated by the long delays in processing claims. Twelve years ago, the New York state Labor Department ruled that a limousine company called Altour Service owed 25 drivers more than $250,000 in back pay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altour Service allegedly charged all its customers a 20 percent gratuity fee and then didn\u2019t share that money with its drivers. In 2005, the New York Labor Department ordered the firm to give the drivers nearly $260,000 in back pay. Altour Service appealed that decision to the state Industrial Board of Appeals, which in 2012 upheld the state Labor Department\u2019s decision. Altour then appealed again, this time to the New York state Supreme Court appellate division. In 2015, a full 10 years after the initial ruling, the court once again upheld the state Labor Department\u2019s decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after the appellate division upheld the drivers\u2019 claim, several told POLITICO that no money changed hands. That was because the company, Altour Service, no longer existed. Even as it continued filing briefs in its court cases, Altour Service dissolved as a company in April 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altour Service shared an address with a much larger firm, the 1,500-employee Altour International, but that firm has no legal responsibility for its debts, according to Altour Service\u2019s attorney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Altour Service, Altour International&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;was run by a businessman&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;named Alexandre Chemla, who remains its president. Altour Service\u2019s 2014 certificate of dissolution listed Chemla as chief executive officer and listed 1270 Avenue of the Americas, 15th floor, as the dissolved company\u2019s address. Altour International&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;resides at the same address, same floor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cAltour Service and Altour International were separate corporate entities involved in different lines of business,\u201d Justin Sher, an attorney for the now-liquidated Altour Service, told POLITICO in an email. \u201cAltour Service was not a subsidiary of Altour International. Altour International has no obligations with respect to Altour Service\u2019s debts.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about whether Altour International would speak on its own behalf, Sher responded in an email, \u201cI am in touch with the company, and it has no further comment.\u201d Altour International did not respond to a request for comment from Chemla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altour Service\u2019s former limousine drivers, though, think those who backed Altour Service, and profited from it, should still be held accountable for its debts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThey dragged it out for years,\u201d one of the drivers, Edgar Lewis, told POLITICO. \u201cThe finding was that we were right and they were wrong. But then Altour and its management \u2014 they refused.\u201d Another driver, Fredy Monzon,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;said he hadn\u2019t received any back pay, either. \u201cTo me, this is news,\u201d he said. \u201cJesus Christ \u2026 I didn\u2019t realize how much I was awarded.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third driver, lead plaintiff Raymond Hulen, declined to speak to POLITICO directly. But through a friend, Kenneth Brown, he&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;confirmed that he not received any money, either, as of last December. \u201cAll the money you spent [to go to court] is way more than it would cost you to reimburse your employees and give them their money back,\u201d Brown said, referring to Altour Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When POLITICO asked Sher, the Altour Service attorney, whether any of the 25 drivers received their back pay, Sher emailed that Altour Service was \u201cparty to an agreement that contains confidentiality restrictions and will not comment further about the details of any payments.\u201d&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, larger companies avoid the risk of violating wage-and-hour laws by keeping low-wage workers off the payroll. Unlike small businesses, big ones can\u2019t easily be dissolved, and they\u2019re much more sensitive to bad publicity. They also make fatter targets for wage-theft investigations because they have deeper pockets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big companies typically steer clear of low-wage workers through what Weil, who administered the Labor Department\u2019s Wage and Hour division under Obama, called \u201cthe fissured workplace\u201d in an influential 2014 book of that name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weil cited three ways in which a large company typically avoids responsibility for low-wage workers. It can contract hourly work out to another, smaller company \u2014 for example, by hiring a janitorial service rather than employing janitors directly. Or the big company can consign hourly work to franchisees; more than 80 percent of McDonald's restaurants are owned not by McDonald's but by McDonald's franchises, who do the hiring and firing. Or the big company can classify certain workers as independent contractors (i.e., \u201cgig\u201d workers), as Federal Express\u2019 ground service has done with its drivers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever \u201cthere's attenuated supply chains and so much subcontracting, it's much harder to track down the contractor,\u201d Janice Fine, a professor at Rutgers University, explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cFissuring\u201d the workplace has allowed big companies to focus on their core competencies, enhancing productivity. But it\u2019s also increased the likelihood that wage-and-hour laws will be violated. Low-wage employers win contracts by bidding low; franchisees, by signing franchise contracts that, especially with big brands, can be financially burdensome; and independent contractors, by working for whatever the buyer is willing to pay. (Independent contractors, who theoretically work on their own, are not covered by&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;minimum-wage laws.) All three downstream arrangements squeeze profit margins, creating, for contractors and franchisees, a potential incentive to cut corners on labor laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large company needn\u2019t worry it will be held liable for any wage theft committed by a contractor or franchisee unless it can be demonstrated that the large company\u2019s arms-length relationship with the contractor or franchisee\u2019s low-wage workers is a fiction. That\u2019s difficult to prove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration made it somewhat easier by broadening the legal criteria for classifying a company a so-called joint employer.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;But the Trump administration reversed that policy in December in a ruling from its majority-Republican National Labor Relations Board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, Trump nominated Cheryl Stanton to lead the Labor Department\u2019s Wage and Hour division.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Since 2013, Stanton has been executive director of the Department of Employment and Workforce in South Carolina, one of the&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;states that dedicates not a single government employee to investigate minimum wage and overtime violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stanton was herself sued in March 2016 for failing to pay a housekeeper named Laurie Titus, the nonprofit Center for Investigative Reporting&lt;a href=\"https://www.revealnews.org/blog/trumps-expected-pick-for-wage-chief-sued-for-stiffing-house-cleaners/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; in July. \u201cI have emailed, mailed and certified mailed trying to get payment,\u201d Titus&lt;a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3880158-Sunflower-Cleaning-v-Cheryl-Stanton.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; said&lt;/a&gt; in her complaint, which requested $360 for four cleanings in September and October 2015, plus $80 to cover court costs and $125 in late fees. Last year, Stanton resolved her dispute with Titus, who told the court that Stanton had \u201cpaid in full.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Labor Department declined to comment on Stanton\u2019s dispute with Titus, and declined a request for comment by Stanton, who is awaiting confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with Stanton\u2019s dispute with Titus told POLITICO that \u201cthis was a contractual dispute with a company, not a wage dispute with an individual \u2026 it involved what days services had been performed and what had been paid.\u201d&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;***&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simplest way to prevent employers from simply closing up shop and avoiding wage-theft judgments would be for both the federal government and state governments to give their labor departments and individuals the authority to file liens, or property claims, even before a state agency or court determines whether the claim has merit, according to workers\u2019 advocates. That way, a company\u2019s assets would be secured even if the owner tries to close up shop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liens are not a new concept. They date back to 1791, when Thomas Jefferson and James Madison requested that the Maryland state Legislature create a so-called mechanics\u2019 lien to speed up construction of Washington, D.C. Today, every state has a mechanics\u2019 lien allowing a construction worker to, in effect, seize some portion of the property he\u2019s helped build if his contractor fails to pay him. In addition, there are about 600 state lien laws that apply to other professions, from jewelers to veterinarians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many state governments&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;have given their labor departments the authority to place a lien on an employer\u2019s property only after they determine that a worker is owed money. Because a final judgment can take many months, worker advocates say such laws give employers too much time to fold their companies, transfer their assets, or reincorporate under a different name. Prejudgment liens, they argue, would discourage employers from using these tactics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get us to 100 percent, but a generalized wage lien is going to get us a lot closer,\u201d said Hollander, of Community Legal Services of Philadelphia.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;\u201cIt gives you the ability to put a hold on the employer\u2019s property from the beginning of the case so there\u2019s not the opportunity for the employer to divest.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wisconsin and Maryland&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;have broad prejudgment liens.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Similar bills have been introduced in New York,&lt;a href=\"https://openstates.org/ct/bills/2015/SB1037/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; Connecticut,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bill%2520Reports/House/1486%2520HBR%2520LAWS%252017.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; Washington State,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://gov.oregonlive.com/bill/2017/HB2180/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; Oregon&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140AB1164\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; California.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wisconsin\u2019s law that allows for prejudgment liens was enacted 1976. Under the law, the state\u2019s Department of Workforce Development or a worker claiming wage theft may file a notice of lien in county court before a judgment is reached on the merits of the case. As a result, fully 95 percent of claims filed with the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development were \u201csettled, dismissed or paid in full\u201d between 2007 and 2012,\u201d according to an analysis by UCLA and the National Employment Law Project, a left-leaning nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Maryland\u2019s prejudgment lien law, passed in 2013, has yet to make much&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;difference because its Department of Labor has never used it. One problem, worker advocates in Maryland say, is that&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;many&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;scofflaw employers don\u2019t have any assets to seize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses have fiercely opposed prejudgment lien laws. When California considered prejudgment liens in 2013, a broad coalition of business groups led by the California Chamber of Commerce &lt;a href=\"http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/13-14/bill/asm/ab_1151-1200/ab_1164_cfa_20130422_120357_asm_comm.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;wrote state legislators &lt;/a&gt;that such liens would &amp;quot;cripple California businesses\u201d by allowing liens \u201con an employer's real property or any property where an employee 'bestowed labor' for an alleged, yet unproven, wage claim.&amp;quot;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;They further argued that the bill would hurt commercial and real estate investments by prioritizing wage theft liens over other liens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some alternatives to prejudgment lien laws have been considered. In Texas, Rep. Mary Gonz&amp;aacute;lez, a Democrat representing El Paso, introduced&lt;a href=\"http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/pdf/HB00202I.pdf#navpanes=0\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; a bill&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 that would create a database of employers who have failed to pay their workers the wages that they are owed legally. In New York, after The New York Times ran a series on wage theft in New York City nail salons, Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued an executive action that required nail-salon owners to purchase&lt;a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-wage-bond-requirements-nail-salon-owners-and-availability-new-nail\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; wage bonds&lt;/a&gt; to guarantee that workers awarded stolen wages actually receive their money. Under the executive action, if a nail salon owner decided to fold, the surety bond company would pay the workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tools like prejudgment liens and wage bonds might help workers recover their wages, but, advocates insist, they won\u2019t be effective without a stronger commitment from states. For states to do a better job enforcing wage and overtime laws, they must first demonstrate that they care enough to devote the manpower necessary.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Until they do that, advocates say, the nation\u2019s wage-and-hour laws will be followed only when employers feel like doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Said Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), ranking member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee: \u201cIf there is not strong enforcement of wage theft, then any efforts to raise the minimum wage, strengthen overtime, or protect workers\u2019 tips are ineffectual.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 11:51:33 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>mlevine@politico.com (Marianne LeVine)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/18/minimum-wage-not-enforced-investigation-409644</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Ex-Clinton aide makes mystery bid for California governor</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/18/amanda-renteria-california-governor-bid-hillary-clinton-aide-416847</link>\n      <description>Democrats are scratching their heads over Amanda Renteria's silent run. Some suggest there are ulterior motives.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES \u2014 Amanda Renteria, the former top Hillary Clinton campaign aide who baffled Democrats when she filed paperwork recently to run for California governor, still isn\u2019t talking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the days since filing, Renteria made no campaign announcement and is not returning reporters\u2019 calls. She\u2019s raised no money and has no apparent political apparatus \u2014 a bizarre campaign opening more characteristic of a fringe candidate than a political professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up and down California, Democrats spent the week scratching their heads \u2014 or suggesting ulterior motives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d said Garry South, a longtime Democratic strategist who advised former Gov. Gray Davis. \u201cYou don\u2019t run for governor of California in four months. The state is too big, the race for governor is far too expensive, and you particularly don\u2019t do it when you are a complete unknown, you have no money, you have no campaign kitty, and you don\u2019t even have a website or a Facebook page.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Renteria\u2019s case, South added, \u201cYou have no staff, you have no consultants, you have no endorsements and you don\u2019t even put out a press release.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renteria, a former aide to Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Debbie Stabenow, gained prominence in political circles as national political director of Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign. But Renteria is not widely known in California, and her last bid for elected office, in a House contest in 2014, ended in bruising defeat. Rep. David Valadao that year trounced Renteria by more than 15 percentage points in her effort to dislodge the Republican from his Central Valley seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renteria\u2019s filing for the gubernatorial race comes less than four months before the June primary, and she will start far behind a large field of more prominent Democrats who have been courting activists, securing endorsements and raising millions of dollars for more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it wasn\u2019t for her political pedigree, it\u2019s likely no one would have even paid attention to her bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats familiar with Renteria said she could be seeking to build name recognition for a future, more credible, run for statewide office, while supporters of former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, one of two leading Democratic candidates for governor, feared her candidacy could undercut his support among Latinos and voters in the Central Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dean Florez, a former Democratic state senator, called Renteria a \u201cspoiler,\u201d writing on Twitter, \u201cCompletely saddened by this development. If you are running for Governor, announce 6 months ago, attend the debates, hold a press conference with your supporters &amp;amp; speak directly to the press.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Madrid, a Republican consultant working with Villaraigosa, said on KQED\u2019s \u201cPolitical Breakdown\u201d podcast Thursday that \u201csomething just doesn\u2019t smell right with what happened. ... We know something else is afoot. ... You don\u2019t run for office and file 30 days out [before the filing deadline] with no endorsement, no infrastructure and no campaign website.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if Renteria is a stalking horse for Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor who\u2019s leading in the polls, Madrid said, \u201cI think the dots are there \u2026 I think it was sloppy all the way around.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newsom spokesman Dan Newman dismissed the accusation of collusion as the political equivalent of a \u201ctinfoil-covered grassy knoll.\u201d In an email, he added, \u201cNot to mention it\u2019s severely sexist for team Antonio [Villaraigosa] to paint an accomplished woman as the naive rube manipulated by a bunch of dudes.\u201d&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Renteria said in a message to POLITICO on Twitter, \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch next week.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;News of Renteria\u2019s candidacy first emerged as if by accident, when the California Target Book\u2019s Rob Pyers noticed her filing with the secretary of state\u2019s office, &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/rpyers/status/963828383749521409\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;tweeting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, \u201cWell this is interesting...Hillary Clinton's 2016 National Political Director has apparently filed to run for California Governor.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A top aide to state Attorney General Xavier Becerra, Renteria immediately became unreachable. She said &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmandaRenteria/status/963836589842432000\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;on Twitter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, \u201cFor questions coming in right now: I am still serving as the Chief of Operations at the California Department of Justice.\u201d But just hours later, Becerra\u2019s office confirmed she was stepping down from her post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a note to colleagues later posted on Medium, Renteria thanked employees of Becerra\u2019s office for \u201ccaring so deeply about the people of California and the sanctity of our justice system.\u201d She did not mention her campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI know nothing,\u201d said Eric Bauman, chairman of the California Democratic Party. \u201cAmanda certainly has my phone number, and she didn\u2019t call me and didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renteria\u2019s candidacy comes too late for her to compete for the state party\u2019s endorsement, and she will not be offered a speaking spot at the party\u2019s upcoming convention in San Diego, Bauman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe program is done and there\u2019s not a free minute in it,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bauman added, \u201cI have no intel on what she\u2019s thinking, what her plan is, who\u2019s running her race. I\u2018ve known her for a long time, and we talked at least once a week during the many, many months of the Clinton campaign \u2026 I don\u2019t know what her mission is here.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renteria drew support from prominent Democrats in her 2014 House run, including EMILY\u2019s List and the Latino Victory Project. Then-Vice President Joe Biden campaigned alongside her. Following Clinton\u2019s defeat, she has spoken publicly about the importance of electing women to public office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the large field of candidates running to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown, only one candidate other than Renteria, Delaine Eastin, is a woman. Eastin, a former state schools chief, has struggled to raise money and is languishing in public opinion polls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eastin shrugged off Renteria\u2019s entry into the race, saying, \u201cThe more the merrier.\u201d But she added, \u201cThe best public policy comes from people who have worked in public policy. ... It puts you at a disadvantage if you have never run for public office in California.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Renteria\u2019s voicemail was full. Bob Mulholland, a longtime Democratic strategist in California, said Renteria\u2019s candidacy is \u201cstrange, unless she has won the Publishers Clearing House [sweepstakes] this month.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he said, \u201cIt may be that she sees \u2026 2018 will be the year of the woman, and it may be that she\u2019s looking at getting more coverage and running for something else down the road. And I admire that.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a text message exchange with Renteria a few weeks ago, Mulholland said, Renteria asked him if he was supporting anyone for governor. It didn\u2019t occur to him that she was running. But he said, \u201cShe must have been thinking about it for a while and decided to do it.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 12:10:57 GMT</pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>Carla Marinucci</dc:creator>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/18/amanda-renteria-california-governor-bid-hillary-clinton-aide-416847</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Is Conor Lamb the Next Big Democratic Upset?</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/18/conor-lamb-pennsylvania-special-election-profile-217018</link>\n      <description>This 33-year-old Marine has a chance at winning one of the GOP\u2019s most reliable districts.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, Pa. \u2014 \u201cJesus always started out by going and being with a certain group of people,\u201d says Conor Lamb as we\u2019re winding down hilly back roads to the Washington County Gun Show. It snowed a few inches in Southwestern Pennsylvania last night and, other than the highways we\u2019re avoiding, nothing\u2019s been plowed. While I\u2019m silently saying Hail Marys as the campaign staffer driving whips around farms and fields, Lamb calmly continues explaining how his faith informs his politics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus, Lamb tells me, tried to get to know people as people before he tried to win them over with arguments. He \u201cwasn\u2019t asking people where they stood on abortion before they came and sat down with them.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lamb, the Democratic candidate in a neck-and-neck special election on March 13, has to hope the people of Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District will likewise listen to what he has to say before judging him by his party affiliation. In this part of the state, where highway billboards sport Bible verses and the start of deer hunting season is a holiday, Democratic politicians tend to flunk doctrinal tests.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Even though&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;registered Democrats technically outnumber Republicans here by 70,000, Trump won the district by nearly 20 percentage points. Mitt Romney and John McCain posted similar margins. Former Rep. Tim Murphy, the outspoken anti-abortion Republican whose seat Lamb is running to fill\u2014Murphy resigned after reports that he encouraged his married mistress to get an abortion after a pregnancy scare\u2014won eight straight elections, the first six by double-digit margins and the last two uncontested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lamb, a square-jawed&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;33-year-old Marine Corps officer who resigned from his job as a federal prosecutor in Pittsburgh to run, has a chance to upend the district\u2019s politics\u2014as long as he can avoid being labeled a liberal without discouraging the district\u2019s not inconsiderable Democrat base from turning out. A devout Catholic, Lamb is pro-union and pro-gun, backs bipartisan deals for fixing Obamacare and the nation\u2019s infrastructure, wants more job training and less college debt, and says he\u2019s pro-fracking but pro-environment, too. And he\u2019s betting that this mix of economic populism and moderate social politics can win the predominantly blue collar district. (Full disclosure: Lamb and I both played rugby at the University of Pennsylvania. We overlapped his senior year, 2005-06.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lamb\u2019s opponent, state Rep. Rick Saccone\u2014best known for sponsoring a bill that would have required posting \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d on every school in the Commonwealth\u2014has a simpler message: He was \u201c&lt;a href=\"http://wesa.fm/post/gop-nominates-state-rep-rick-saccone-replace-former-congressman-tim-murphy#stream/0\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Trump before Trump was Trump&lt;/a&gt;,\u201d and is an enthusiastic supporter of the president\u2019s agenda. But there are signs the president\u2019s popularity is waning here. A Monmouth University poll showed 42 percent of voters in the 18th strongly disapprove of his performance, compared with just 37 percent who strongly approve. When asked if they support the president\u2019s efforts in office, 48 percent said yes, 47 percent said no. Trump\u2019s endorsement of Saccone made 5 percent of respondents say they were more likely to back Saccone; it made 8 percent say they were more likely to support Lamb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given these shifting politics, political observers say Lamb has a tight, but plausible, path to victory in March. He needs suburban women with college educations and moderate social views\u2014both Democrats and Republicans wavering in their party allegiances post Trump\u2014to back him big (which is probably why he praises nurses and teachers in the same breath as veterans and cops). He also needs the district\u2019s 86,000 union households to vote their economic interests, and for enough of the rural, working-class Republican base to find him sufferable to stay home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Republican Party sees this path too\u2014and is pouring resources, both money and manpower, into this Pennsylvania district ahead of March 13. So far, Republican super PACs have thrown millions into the race, opening canvassing offices and flooding Pittsburgh\u2019s airwaves with ads calling Lamb a liberal. Trump himself made a visit to support Saccone\u2014as have Ivanka Trump and Vice President Mike Pence\u2014and says he will return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, the stakes are enormous. As the polls narrow\u2014the &lt;a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/MonmouthPoll_PA_021518/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;latest&lt;/a&gt; has Lamb just 3 points behind Saccone\u2014this race is being closely watched by political seismologists for early tremors of an oncoming blue tsunami in the November midterms. If Lamb, a virtual unknown five months ago, can win this once seemingly impregnable Republican stronghold\u2014one that so overwhelmingly supported Trump just 16 months ago, then other Democratic candidates across the country can do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;On this frigid Saturday in early January, &lt;/b&gt;Lamb has just wrapped up a rally at an American Legion in tiny Houston, Pennsylvania, where around 70 supporters braved snow-covered roads to hear him speak. But the labor leaders and left-leaning vets that filled the hall are already members of Lamb\u2019s growing flock of disciples. There\u2019s more missionary work to be done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cMy faith tells me where to go and get started and what kind of sympathy to have for people once you get there,\u201d Lamb says. Today, his faith is leading him to the gun show in Washington County. Lamb has plotted a path to victory that runs through places like this, where he can evangelize to voters like Ken Gedeon, who is idling beside a display case full of World War II-era sidearms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gedeon is a registered Democrat and an avid hunter. The retiree from Jefferson Hills, Pennsylvania, is upset at Saccone for supporting a bill to allow the use of automatic rifles during deer season. \u201cWhen I grew up, I was taught: You shoot one shot,\u201d Gedeon says. \u201cYou don\u2019t come get a second or third shot.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gedeon voted for Trump. \u201cI felt good voting for who I voted for,\u201d he adds, unprompted. And he still feels good about his vote. \u201cYes, 100 percent,\u201d he says. \u201cNo qualms about him at all.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Gedeon votes for the man, not the party. After Lamb introduces himself, Gedeon wastes no time sharing his displeasure with Saccone, practically a neighbor, for never asking him about the hunting bill. Lamb asserts he\u2019s pro-hunter and pro-gun, says he would\u2019ve given Gedeon a call, and asks for his support. (Years ago, at an alumni gathering when Lamb was still a Marine Corps JAG and I was in law school, he and I got into it over gun control, where he questioned why the vast majority of responsible gun owners should have their freedoms burdened by the sins of a few criminals, and the practical improbability of any law managing to significantly reduce the number of guns.) Gedeon ends the short conversation with a handshake, says he hasn\u2019t made up his mind yet, but he\u2019s open to voting Democrat in the special election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe can get him,\u201d Lamb says confidently a few minutes later as we walk toward a Marines-themed display case full of combat knives. If he can meet voters, and talk to them\u2014&lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; talk to them honestly and rationally, and not get bogged down by partisan labels and national politics\u2014Lamb\u2019s sure he can win this thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, immigration.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;In a district dotted with shuttered steel mills, Lamb believes voters will come around to his position if he can hold an honest, earnest discussion. \u201cI think too often the whole issue gets talked about as if we were writing from a blank slate, or we can pick whatever we want, or the government is all powerful,\u201d Lamb says. \u201cNone of which is true.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are only four real options on immigration, Lamb explains. One, try to kick every undocumented immigrant out. Two, legalize the Dreamers\u2014undocumented immigrants brought here as children\u2014but try to kick out all the other migrants here illegally. Three, \u201cthe Dreamers obviously should stay,\u201d and \u201cthe other  11&amp;frac12; million people, who knows how they got here, but they\u2019re here, they\u2019re in the shadows, that\u2019s not really helping anybody, [so] let\u2019s find a way to pull them out [of the shadows.]\u201d And then there\u2019s four: no change, continue the current policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI really believe that if you present those four options to people, 90 percent choose option three,\u201d he says, adding that he also supports increased border security, but at ports of entry, not a wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lamb also believes voters can distinguish between a politician who is pro-coal worker\u2014like he is, backing a &lt;a href=\"http://www.post-gazette.com/powersource/policy-powersource/2016/09/08/Politicians-turn-up-heat-to-solve-coal-miner-pension-crisis/stories/201609080011\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;federal guaranty miners\u2019 pensions&lt;/a&gt;\u2014rather than just pro-coal. The lost mining jobs aren\u2019t coming back, Lamb says. \u201cWe have to get real about what the options are, and make sure the economy is diverse,\u201d which means he\u2019s not ready to trash the Clean Air Act just yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Lamb trusts voters can accept that he\u2019s anti-abortion, personally, but respects that choice is the law of the land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without naming Trump, Lamb is taking him head-on, stylistically if not substantively (the candidate is quick to say he\u2019s eager to work on issues like infrastructure and opioids with the president). While Trump and his detractors trade competing narrative volleys, armed with alternative sets of facts to back their differing opinions, Lamb is betting his campaign on his ability to marshal objective truth to cut through the noise and sway voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Lamb knows no one will listen to his well-argued points if the district\u2019s 93-percent white, predominantly working-class residents dismiss him as just another liberal elitist before he can even open his mouth. \u201cFDR said one time that the true test of government was that people wanted to know that their government walked on the same side of the street that they did,\u201d Lamb says. \u201cSo, that\u2019s the impression I want people to be left with: Not necessarily what my policy papers say, just that I\u2019m accessible and that I\u2019m one of them\u2014that they can always find me, and trust me to at least tell them the truth.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a campaign strategy that hinges on how Lamb interacts with voters\u2014something he does pretty well for a novice. He tends to speak with deep resolve in his voice\u2014even his questions seem to end in periods. Like a lot of politicians, Lamb is tall\u20146-foot-3\u2014but he has a habit of leaning in and jutting his head forward a bit when he talks to voters, as if he\u2019s been drawn in by whatever you have to say. He\u2019ll repeat your name before the conversation\u2019s end, and make a lame joke at his own expense about getting lost once in your home town. The body language, the call backs, the self-deprecation all instill the sense that he\u2019s really listening\u2014a useful trick here, where voters have long felt forgotten. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If Lamb does retail politics like a natural,&lt;/b&gt; it might be because he comes from a political family. Lamb was born and raised in the suburbs of Pittsburgh to a family of Irish Catholic Democrats. His grandfather, Tom, was the Democratic majority leader in the state Senate and his uncle, Michael, is Pittsburgh\u2019s controller. After high school at all-boys Central Catholic, Lamb moved across the state to go to the University of Pennsylvania, where he stayed for law school. After Penn, Lamb eschewed big law for the Marine Corps, which commissioned him as a Judge Advocate in Okinawa, Japan, despite Lamb\u2019s request to go into infantry.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;(\u201cYou went to Penn Law,\u201d Lamb remembers being told, \u201cI can make anybody an infantry officer, I need you to be a lawyer.\u201d)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He counts a Lasallian Christian Brother among his closest friends. The two like to critique Sunday liturgy the way movie buffs discuss an actor\u2019s performance, picking apart not just what was said in the homily, but how it was delivered. Such careful focus on how a priest can enliven and update material that\u2019s  2,000 years old has paid off on the trail, where Lamb tends to deliver short, lively speeches heavy on patriotism and optimism and light on legislative proposals, leaving the longer policy discussions for one-on-one chats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He\u2019s not afraid to throw some punches, though.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;As a federal prosecutor, Lamb directed a righteous fury at \u201cmorally bankrupt\u201d drug dealers and gun runners. On the campaign trail, it\u2019s mostly Saccone and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan who draw his opprobrium. After the American Legion campaign rally, Lamb grants a series of interviews, fielding questions about abortion, Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Trump. For Lamb, nothing good can come from those lines of inquiry, and so he deflects. \u201cI\u2019m not running against the president, I\u2019m running against Rick Saccone,\u201d Lamb likes to say, pivoting to a litany of his opponent\u2019s shortcomings. \u201cHe votes against education funding, he voted against Narcan, the thing that saves people\u2019s lives, and he\u2019s gonna have some explaining about his support for Paul Ryan, who now wants to come after Medicare and Social Security.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lamb has also run heavily on the Republican tax cuts, calling them a \u201c&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/conorlambpa/status/936700916509696000?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;complete betrayal of the middle class&lt;/a&gt;.\u201d So too have the super PACs backing Saccone. Their attack on Lamb can be summed up as, \u201cHe\u2019s a liberal who opposes the tax cuts and would support Nancy Pelosi.\u201d The truth is more complicated\u2014Lamb has actually called on Pelosi to step down from Democratic leadership\u2014but it\u2019s difficult to say whether voters will even get to hear those protestations over the massive amounts of super PAC attack ads asserting otherwise. Republican PACs have already spent &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/gop-allied-groups-heavily-outspend-democrats-in-special-pennsylvania-election/2018/02/05/4ed46e94-0a8b-11e8-8890-372e2047c935_story.html?utm_term=.2d6958236b60\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;$4.7 million &lt;/a&gt; in support of Saccone since Murphy&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;resigned in October. That\u2019s double what Murphy &lt;a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/elections?cid=N00024992&amp;amp;cycle=2018\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;had to fundraise&lt;/a&gt; in any of his races in the 18th. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Republicans are trying to make all politics national, Lamb\u2019s trying to keep things local.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;He has foresworn super PAC support and is keeping the fired-up national Democratic groups at arms-length. According to &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/gop-allied-groups-heavily-outspend-democrats-in-special-pennsylvania-election/2018/02/05/4ed46e94-0a8b-11e8-8890-372e2047c935_story.html?utm_term=.248c1673db45\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;the &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Republican-linked groups have outspent their Democratic rivals here 17-to-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His campaign says it\u2019s a deliberate move\u2014that he\u2019s worried that outside PAC support would boomerang and bolster the accusations that he\u2019s just another liberal Democrat. His campaign maintains it doesn\u2019t want to fall into the same trap Jon Ossoff did in Georgia, where national groups flooded in and turned the first special election after 2016 into a referendum on the two national parties instead of two individuals running for Congress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lamb, who managed to raise $560,000 in just two months last year and has spent nearly a million so far in campaign ads, feels he can personally raise enough money to keep the race close, especially given his opponent\u2019s reputation as a weak fundraiser. Saccone raised just $214,000 last year, including $42,000 transferred from a Senate campaign he abandoned to seek the 18th&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;seat, and his campaign has spent less than $100,000 on ads. (Saccone\u2019s campaign did not respond to repeated interview requests.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lamb has recently accepted outside help from some prominent Democrats, but only those who fit the mold: white, Catholic, pro-union. Rep. Joe Kennedy III made a campaign stop, and Rep. Tim Ryan, who challenged Pelosi for leadership, has sent fundraising appeals on Lamb\u2019s behalf. So, too, did Randy Bryce, the Democratic ironworker challenging Paul Ryan in Wisconsin. Joe Biden will &lt;a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/joe-biden-will-campaign-for-conor-lamb-in-tight-pennsylvania-race\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;make a visit&lt;/a&gt; and his American Possibilities PAC sent out a fundraising letter on Lamb\u2019s behalf. &lt;br /&gt;Some of Lamb\u2019s supporters worry that his overabundance of caution is allowing Republicans to define him\u2014a serious disadvantage for a candidate with little name recognition. The &lt;a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/MonmouthPoll_PA_021518/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;same poll&lt;/a&gt; taken in mid-February that showed Lamb within striking distance of Saccone also showed that 20 percent of district voters still had no opinion of him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t think the campaign is taking advantage of the moment right now,\u201d says a Democratic consultant familiar with the area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThere isn\u2019t any doubt that [Lamb\u2019s] being significantly outspent on television by the Saccone people and their interests,\u201d says G. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin and Marshall College poll and the dean of Pennsylvania political observers. \u201cThe Democrats at a national level and their interest groups don\u2019t seem to be nearly as engaged. \u2026 The Republicans realize how significant this is and they don\u2019t want to risk losing this seat and creating a literal meltdown.\u201d&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The special election won\u2019t directly affect&lt;/b&gt; the outcome of the November midterms. Lamb and Saccone are running to fill the remainder of Murphy\u2019s term, meaning that whoever wins will be up for reelection just seven months later in November. Win or lose, Lamb says he\u2019ll be running again then. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By then, the district may look radically different than it does today. In January, the state Supreme Court found Pennsylvania\u2019s congressional districts unconstitutional and ordered the General Assembly to draw up new maps in time for the May primary. Republicans in Harrisburg have &lt;a href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/graphic-pa-republican-leaders-propose-new-congressional-map-eve-deadline/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;submitted a new map&lt;/a&gt; that would make the 18th  District even&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;more rural and place Lamb\u2019s Mount Lebanon home outside of the district. Pennsylvania Democrats immediately decried the new plans, and Gov. Tom Wolf submitted his own in response. The state Supreme Court said it will decide on a map by Monday and may draw its own\u2014a decision that is likely set off another set of legal challenges before any redistricting is finalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, Lamb\u2019s focused on the race ahead of him. After a full day on the trail, I meet up with him at a&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;dimly lit corner table at a Hilton Garden Inn just outside Pittsburgh. It\u2019s 7:30 p.m. on a Saturday and I\u2019m nursing a beer. Lamb, who started his day at 5:30 a.m., orders a coffee, black. He has more meetings after this interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re joined at the table by Lamb\u2019s younger brother, Coleman, who\u2019s working full time on the campaign for free, lest anyone accuse Conor of nepotism, and Mike Madeo, the candidate\u2019s body man. Madeo, who met Lamb in the Marines, is now playing &lt;i&gt;aide-de-campaign&lt;/i&gt; for a guy four years his junior. I ask him why. He leans in and looks me directly in the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI think he\u2019s the antidote to what is wrong with modern day politics,\u201d Madeo says. \u201cI think he\u2019s actually going to work with people to try to get shit done.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minus the swearing, it\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d expect from a campaign staffer. But it\u2019s also a testament of faith I hear again and again from Lamb\u2019s choir of die-hard supporters: He can transcend this world of partisan hackery, fake news narratives and outrage-driven politics. Just how much of that is actually about Lamb, and how much of that is simply anti-Trump fervor, is hard to tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For his part, the candidate does little to dampen the hopes others place in him to restore politics to some bygone era when morally outstanding men brokered bipartisan deals and used long-winded, in-person arguments to sway voters instead of outrage-inducing tribal appeals on Twitter and TV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, he sees it as a kind of legacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cMy grandfather \u2026 always used to say\u2014I remember it really well\u2014that he was proud to be a politician,\u201d says Lamb, who bought and moved into his grandfather\u2019s Mount Lebanon house last year. \u201cHe wanted to redeem that word.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019ve never been ashamed to tell anyone that I was interested in this life [running for office], because I saw it [growing up], and I knew it could be good. And, honestly, I probably get more motivated the more maligned and degraded the whole thing has become.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 12:20:39 GMT</pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>Jim Saksa</dc:creator>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/18/conor-lamb-pennsylvania-special-election-profile-217018</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Trump attacks everyone but Russia</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/18/trump-twitter-mueller-fbi-russia-scandal-416858</link>\n      <description>The president continues his barrage of tweets after the Mueller indictments.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump railed against the investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election Saturday night into Sunday, sending off a stream of tweets attacking the FBI, CNN, the Democratic Party, his own national security adviser, former President Barack Obama and the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not criticize Russia, or voice concern over Vladimir Putin's attempts to undermine U.S. elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord, disruption and chaos within the U.S. then, with all of the Committee Hearings, Investigations and Party hatred, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. They are laughing their asses off in Moscow. Get smart America!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter Sunday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tweets came after special counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russians on Friday for their efforts to interfere in the 2016 election and aid Trump\u2019s campaign. The Twitter broadsides attracted bipartisan pushback as Republicans and Democrats expressed frustration that Trump is not taking the Russian threat seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House has sought to frame the indictments as vindication, since they do not allege collusion with the Trump campaign, but senior aides have voiced concern that Trump would lash out at the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump confirmed those fears on Saturday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cVery sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign \u2014 there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;That statement stirred bipartisan ire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI think it\u2019s an absurd statement. Absurd,\u201d said Gov. John Kasich (R-Ohio) on CNN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others reacted to that tweet, and the rest, with something of an eye-roll.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\u201cMaybe it was a bad idea for him to stay off the golf course,\u201d quipped one senior GOP Hill aide in response to a query from POLITICO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trump  also went after his national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, who said the evidence of Russian meddling was \u201cincontrovertible.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cGeneral McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company!\u201d Trump wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Sunday morning, he was on to attacking Obama for the nuclear deal with Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cNever gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send $1.7 Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress, the FBI or Justice called for an investigation!\u201d Trump wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then, he moved on to the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cFinally, Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff, the leakin\u2019 monster of no control, is now blaming the Obama administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election. He is finally right about something. Obama was President, knew of the threat, and did nothing. Thank you Adam!\u201d Trump wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He later added: \u201cNow that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election, he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats, lead by their fearless leader, Crooked Hillary Clinton, lost the 2016 election. But wasn\u2019t I a great candidate?\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trump also took a moment to defend his past statements that seemed to shed doubt on Russia\u2019s role in election-meddling, writing: \u201cI never said Russia did not meddle in the election, I said \u2018it may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.\u2019 The Russian \u2018hoax\u2019 was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trump has repeatedly sought to downplay the evidence of Russian interference, and said in November that he believed Putin\u2019s denials of meddling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cEvery time he sees me he says, \u2018I didn\u2019t do that,\u2019 and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it,\u201d Trump said at the time. \u201cI think he is very insulted by it, which is not a good thing for our country.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Twitter tirade was notably absent of any calls to action in addressing Russian interference. That absence drew swift criticism, as well as Trump\u2019s seeming inability to focus on the meaning of the allegations beyond himself and his own campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cAbove all this rhetoric here, we begin losing sight of what is it we\u2019re going to do about the threat of the Russians,\u201d said former director of national intelligence James Clapper in an interview on CNN. \u201cHe never talks about that. It\u2019s all about himself.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis is a president who claims vindication anytime someone sneezes,\u201d Schiff told CNN, and he went on to question why the White House has refused to implement sanctions that Congress passed by huge majorities to punish Russia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt is inexplicable that the president of the United States continues to sit on sanctions that Congress passed, that Congress wants enforced against Russia over this interference,\u201d Schiff said on &amp;quot;State of the Union.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under the law, sanctions were to be imposed by Jan. 30, but the White House demurred at that time, saying the threat of  sanctions was &amp;quot;serving as a deterrent.\u201d &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, also expressed frustration in Trump\u2019s unwillingness to confront Russia over the meddling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cRussia's clearly tried to advance their agenda into the United States,\u201d Lankford told NBC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called Trump\u2019s unwillingness to address Russian interference going forward \u201cone of the weirdest things in modern American history.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cHow do we have the president of the United States not saying what everybody knows to be true?\u201d the 2016 Democdratic presidential candidate continued in an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cRussia interfered in \u201816 and they\u2019re going to interfere in 2018. \u2026 This is a huge deal and that we don\u2019t have a president speaking out on this issue is a horror show.\u201d &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 13:56:56 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>mnussbaum@politico.com (Matthew Nussbaum)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/18/trump-twitter-mueller-fbi-russia-scandal-416858</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Trump lashes out after Mueller indictment, downplays Russian plot</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/17/russia-election-democrats-media-white-house-spokesman-416849</link>\n      <description>The president blasted the 'fake news' media and quoted a Facebook executive as he insisted the Kremlin did not collude with his campaign or influence the 2016 vote.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump lashed out Saturday at suggestions that Russia helped him win the presidency, reiterating that a new federal indictment showed no evidence of collusion between his campaign and the Kremlin and even invoking the words of a Facebook executive in his defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a series of afternoon tweets, Trump responded to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Friday indictment of 13 Russians for a criminal plot that featured social media manipulation and political organizing in support of Trump and against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tweets show Trump\u2019s continued extreme sensitivity to charges that Russian meddling might have helped him win the election, and his ongoing fury at the \u201cfake news\u201d media\u2019s coverage of the saga \u2014 though Trump did not criticize Mueller or other Justice Department and FBI officials, as he has in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amplifying the White House\u2019s initial response to Mueller\u2019s indictment, Trump &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/964944088696049666\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;cited&lt;/a&gt; a conservative columnist who called it a \u201cbig win\u201d for the president, and &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/964946611502747649\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;quoted&lt;/a&gt; Mueller\u2019s Justice Department supervisor saying that the indictment did not allege collusion or say that the Russians altered the outcome of the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!\u201d Trump wrote in one of the &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/964949269374529538\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is true that Mueller\u2019s latest indictment found no evidence of collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russians. But the charges filed Friday cover only one portion of a broad Russian effort to meddle in the 2016 election and do not rule out the possibility of collusion overall. The indictment, which did not touch on issues like the hacking of Democratic emails and meetings between Trump associates and Russians, drew no conclusions about whether the Russian effort might have swayed any votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump also &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/964955496137535488\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;retweeted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/964956781670694912\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; Friday tweets by Facebook\u2019s vice president for advertising, who complained after the Mueller indictment that the media has mischaracterized the motives of Russian advertising on social media. \u201cI have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal,\u201d wrote the executive, Rob Goldman \u2014 a phrase Trump repeated himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also insisted that most online ad spending traced to Russian buyers occurred after the 2016 election, complaining that \u201cvery few outlets have covered it because it doesn\u2019t align with the main media narrative of Trump and the election.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe Fake News Media never fails. Hard to ignore this fact,\u201d Trump wrote in response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intelligence officials and experts have long said that Russia\u2019s primary goal is to destabilize the U.S. political system. But the U.S. intelligence community has also unanimously concluded that, at the same time, the Kremlin favored Trump over Clinton in the 2016 election and clearly worked on Trump\u2019s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman followed up in a Saturday tweet that he was \u201conly speaking here about the Russian behavior on Facebook. That is the only aspect that I observed directly.\u201d A Facebook spokesman said Goldman was tweeting in a personal capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump also tweeted quotes from a Friday press conference by Mueller\u2019s supervisor, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein stated at the News Conference: \u201cThere is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election,\u201d Trump wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And citing a column by New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin titled \u201cCharges Deal Don A Big Win,\u201d Trump wrote that Goodwin \u201csuccinctly states that 'the Russians had no impact on the election results.' There was no Collusion with the Trump Campaign. '[Clinton] lost the old-fashioned way, by being a terrible candidate. Case closed.'&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of Trump\u2019s tweets expressed anger or alarm about the Russian intervention, which Mueller\u2019s charges said involved entry into the U.S. by Russians collecting intelligence for the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;A White House spokesperson went even further Saturday, suggesting that Democrats and the mainstream media deserve more blame than Russia for political division in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThere are two groups that have created chaos more than the Russians,\u201d White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said on Fox News. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the Democrats and the mainstream media who continued to push this lie on the American people for more than a year, and quite frankly Americans should be outraged by that.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even as Trump and Gidley claimed vindication in Friday\u2019s indictments and downplayed the impact of the Russian effort, other top administration officials are acknowledging the attack and calling for consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThere's no question that Russia sought to interfere, perhaps with other countries, in our electoral process and it's absolutely essential that we take action against individuals who attempted to interfere with our democracy,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence told Fox News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;National security adviser H.R. McMaster echoed the point, telling the Munich Security Conference that the evidence of Moscow\u2019s interference is \u201cincontrovertible.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhereas in the past it was difficult to attribute \u2026 now this is in the arena of law enforcement investigation, it\u2019s going to be very apparent to everyone,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump himself has repeatedly suggested that it\u2019s impossible to know who might have hacked the emails of Clinton and the Democratic National Committee, even though the U.S. intelligence community has unanimously concluded it was the work of the Russian government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Trump\u2019s Saturday tweets also noted that Mueller\u2019s indictment says the Russians who are facing charges \u2014 all of them affiliated with the St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency \u2014 began their plot in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cFunny how the Fake News Media doesn\u2019t want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014, long before my run for President. Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn\u2019t know!\u201d Trump wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts have noted that the Russian plot, which Mueller traces to April of 2014, began just after U.S.-Russia relations reached a breaking point following Moscow\u2019s seizure of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula. But Trump had also sent clear signals more than &lt;a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2013/05/27/trump-researching-2016-run/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;a year before&lt;/a&gt; that he was considering a 2016 presidential run. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday\u2019s indictment detailed the extent of Russia\u2019s information warfare and noted that the operatives \u201ccommunicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump Campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress passed sanctions in 2017 to punish Russia for its interference, which Trump signed into law. His administration has so far declined to enact the sanctions, however, saying that they are serving as a \u201cdeterrent.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 19:47:43 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>mnussbaum@politico.com (Matthew Nussbaum)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/17/russia-election-democrats-media-white-house-spokesman-416849</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Republicans race to reverse midterm recruitment failures</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/18/republicans-midterm-recruitment-failures-2018-415671</link>\n      <description>Kevin Cramer's entry into the North Dakota Senate race Friday ended a streak of GOP misses on sought-after candidates.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For months, Republican leaders watched in horror as hordes of their most sought-after midterm recruits passed on running, spooked by what increasingly looked like an electoral beatdown in the making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But leading GOP officials in recent weeks have seen their fortunes brighten \u2014 if only slightly \u2014 and the party is now scrambling to take advantage by luring otherwise reluctant candidates back into targeted races across the country. On Friday, they notched their most significant success yet when Rep. Kevin Cramer reversed his earlier decision, and months of waffling, by announcing his challenge to North Dakota's Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp. And in Florida, Gov. Rick Scott now appears almost certain to take on Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, in another recruiting coup \u2014 and sigh of relief \u2014 for Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their task could not be more urgent. In at least seven of the ten races where Democratic senators are defending states won by Donald Trump in 2016, and roughly half a dozen gubernatorial contests, the long-expected GOP front-runners decided not to run in recent months. There\u2019s still time to turn things around, but with the filing deadline in many states creeping up, Republicans' window to field top-flight candidates is closing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Party officials have feared that pattern \u2014 matched with the historic number of GOP retirements in the House \u2014 was attributable to a growing Democratic backlash against Trump. So the recent good news, they believe, provides a rare opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cRepublicans are in a little bit of a better situation than they have been in other potential wave years. But did we know that six or eight months ago, when a lot of these candidates had to really make these decisions about whether they had to run?,\u201d asked former Ohio GOP chairman Matt Borges, skeptically. \u201cI can\u2019t honestly tell you that people are not concerned about this political environment. I think we\u2019re all appropriately concerned about it.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from North Dakota and Florida, Republicans are closely monitoring machinations in the Missouri Senate race, and pushing to find the right candidate in potentially winnable gubernatorial races from Connecticut to Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, it\u2019s been one bad news story after another for Republicans on the recruitment front. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every top-tier choice who declined was formally recruited by party leaders in Washington, but each was widely expected to consider or mount a serious run before they stepped away from the fray, and those switches forced Republicans to re-tool their game plans in state after state. Furthermore, the absence of a strong front-runner candidate in many of these contests set up a series of uncomfortable GOP primaries the party would have rather avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Indiana, which Trump won by 19 points, long-favored Rep. Susan Brooks surprised many in January 2017 by passing on a chance to oust first-term Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly. That triggered a nasty three-way primary between longtime rivals Rep. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita, as well as self-funding state representative Mike Braun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A month after Brooks\u2019 surprise decision, Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy did the same, leaving state senator Leah Vukmir and Delafield veteran Kevin Nicholson to duke it out in their own escalating primary contest for the right to take on Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The landscape looks similar in two other Midwestern states that unexpectedly voted for Trump in 2016: in Pennsylvania, Rep. Lou Barletta became the front-runner \u2014 and the White House\u2019s top hope to replicate Trump\u2019s success in the state \u2014 only after the favored Rep. Pat Meehan decided against challenging Sen. Bob Casey. (That was probably a blessing for Republicans, since Meehan later announced he wouldn\u2019t seek reelection amid a sexual harassment scandal.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Michigan, Rep. Fred Upton passed on a bid against Sen. Debbie Stabenow after serious consideration, and GOP leaders \u2014 including super PAC chief Steven Law, a top ally of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2014 even encouraged musician Robert Ritchie (a.k.a. Kid Rock) to jump in before he, too, declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list goes on. In Montana, where Trump won by 21 points, Ryan Zinke disappointed some local Republicans by signing up as Trump\u2019s Interior Secretary rather than running to unseat Sen. Jon Tester. State attorney general Tim Fox then passed on a long-expected campaign of his own once it became clear he might have an easier shot at the governor\u2019s mansion in 2020. Now, at least four Republicans are competing for the slot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Virginia and Minnesota \u2014 battlegrounds where Trump fell short in 2016 \u2014 top GOP lawmakers ducked away from the chance to challenge Sen. Tim Kaine and new Sen. Tina Smith, as well as Sen. Amy Klobuchar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in Missouri, Rep. Ann Wagner in July opted against a challenge to Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill despite raising significant campaign cash in early 2017. Her exit then opened the door for state attorney general Josh Hawley to step in, but some local Republicans who are dissatisfied with his campaign\u2019s early days have now encouraged Wagner to reconsider, frustrating national GOP leaders who had hoped for an easy path to victory in the state that Trump carried by 18 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans have avoided the pattern in other key states. Many are confident Scott will soon announce a Senate bid, they were happy to see both Rep. Evan Jenkins and state attorney general Patrick Morrisey run against West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. In Arizona, Rep. Martha McSally is seen as a strong contender to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Jeff Flake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those developments have bolstered party leaders\u2019 confidence that they\u2019ll be able to keep the chamber, especially since they still must defend far fewer seats than Democrats, and many of their targets are in reliably conservative territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo one bats 1.000,\u201d said Rob Jesmer, a former executive director of Senate Republicans\u2019 campaign arm. \u201cBut generally speaking, we have a decent slate of candidates.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, Republican concern over far-right primary challengers to incumbents sponsored by former White House strategist Steve Bannon has faded in recent weeks, freeing them to focus on a handful of targeted races where they can go on offense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cDemocrats want their donors to believe they have a real chance at taking back the Senate, [but] for all the chatter about recruiting, if I look at the landscape, what we\u2019re trying to do is hold the majority, and [we] have the pieces on the board,\u201d said Republican strategist Scott Jennings, who is close to McConnell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In gubernatorial races, Democrats have had troubles finding top candidates of their own in a handful of high-profile contests, including in Michigan and Wisconsin, while Republicans were relieved to land their first picks in swing states like Ohio and Nevada. But, forced to defend 26 of the 36 governors\u2019 mansions up for grabs in 2018, the GOP\u2019s recruiting shortfalls still outnumber their successes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Republicans are now banking on former Gov. Tim Pawlenty \u2014 most recently a bank lobbyist \u2014 to run for his old seat, after Hennepin County sheriff Rich Stanek said in May he would not, leaving a wide-open field. Their chances to keep Maine in Republican hands were decimated after Sen. Susan Collins decided in October to stay in the Senate rather than try to replace Gov. Paul LePage. And a complicated primary has emerged in Pennsylvania \u2014 the one Trump-voting state held by a Democratic governor up for reelection this year \u2014 after one-time front-runner Rep. Mike Kelly opted in May against a run of his own against Gov. Tom Wolf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In New York, even though Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s approval rating has fallen, a parade of Republicans has chosen not to challenge him \u2014 disappointing Republican leaders eager to make Cuomo sweat before he considers a presidential bid. At the same time, California\u2019s GOP now appears likely to fall short of having any Republicans on the general election ballot for governor or senator \u2014 potentially dooming down-ballot GOP candidates there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOP leaders are still hoping to field a prominent challenger to Democratic Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo. And they\u2019re similarly trying to ensure Connecticut\u2019s messy primary to replace unpopular outgoing Gov. Dannel Malloy irons itself out after the state senate\u2019s Republican leader announced he wouldn\u2019t run in August and his state house counterpart did the same last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, nowhere was the search for a candidate more tortured than in North Dakota, a state Trump won by 36 points. Cramer had entered 2017 as Heitkamp\u2019s top likely challengers, but local Republicans began looking elsewhere late last year as he waffled on a run amid a series of gaffes. Then, when a pair of local leaders passed, they again turned to Cramer, who even met with Trump about a run before declining to jump in last month. The back-and-forth infuriated party leaders who saw Heitkamp\u2019s seat as a no-brainer pickup opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cNorth Dakota is a problem, and they feel like he kind of jerked people around a little bit,\u201d said Jennings this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the saga was not over yet. On Tuesday, the Washington Examiner published opposition research on state senator Tom Campbell \u2014 the post-Cramer front-runner \u2014 forwarded to the publication by a \u201cparty operative.\u201d Shortly after, former state party chairman Gary Emineth dropped out of the race, saying Cramer would run, after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was news to both local and national Republicans. The last they had heard, Cramer was \u2014 again \u2014 listening to entreaties from officials begging him to run. Last Friday, Last Friday, he told local reporters he was \u201cmildly reconsidering.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One week later, he was in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 12:03:28 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>gdebenedetti@politico.com (Gabriel Debenedetti)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/18/republicans-midterm-recruitment-failures-2018-415671</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>'Something was weird': Inside the Russian effort to bamboozle Florida</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/mueller-indictment-russia-florida-interference-416255</link>\n      <description>The operation in the nation\u2019s largest swing state was in a class by itself.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The scathing indictment unsealed Friday by special counsel Robert Mueller outlines a multi-state scheme to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. But the document makes clear that the operation in Florida, the nation\u2019s largest swing state, was in a class by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indictment is packed with details of how Russian nationals duped Donald Trump campaign volunteers and grass-roots organizations in Florida into holding rallies they organized and helped fund with foreign cash. And Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio himself was a target of an effort to \u201cdenigrate\u201d him and several other presidential candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, Mueller indicted 13 Russian nationals and a trio of Russian entities for meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign, an operation that focused on hyping Trump, but also on sowing discord and undermining Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz and Rubio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the heat of the 2016 race, Trump campaign officials in Florida said they were surprised by all the grass-roots support for the president \u2014 which seemed entirely organic at the time. In keeping with those comments in 2016, those same campaign officials say they were never made aware of any Russian involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susie Wiles, one of Trump\u2019s top Florida advisers, said staff and volunteers did their due diligence when planning events and coordinating with grass-roots supporters \u2014 but detecting Russian impostors wasn't on anyone's radar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We looked out for things when people came to rallies,&amp;quot; Wiles said in a phone interview. &amp;quot;We weren't looking for fake Americans that were really Russians. The world seems different now.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wiles said she does not remember encountering any groups planning rallies or working in coordination with the campaign that seemed outside the norm of traditional political organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone had any idea,\u201d Wiles said. \u201cThere are always ways someone can manipulate the system, but this was not something we saw.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sue Snowden, head of the Trump campaign\u2019s Palm Beach County operation, said she was \u201cnot qualified to answer\u201d questions about the indictment before hanging up on a POLITICO reporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI was never approached by the FBI,\u201d said Karen Giorno, Trump\u2019s campaign manager in Florida, when asked about whether the campaign had any warning of the Russian activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the charging documents, Mueller noted specific instances when Russian nationals interacted directly with Trump campaign staff, who were oblivious to the fact they were being hoodwinked by Russian agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIn or around August 2016, defendants and their co-conspirators used false U.S. personas to communicate with Trump campaign staff involved in local community outreach,\u201d read the indictment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interactions were part of planning events that were collectively called \u201cFlorida Goes Trump\u201d rallies, and held throughout the state. Russians also helped organize some of the most recognizable anti-Hillary Clinton displays of the election cycle in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cFor example, defendants and their co-conspirators asked one U.S. person to build a cage on on a flatbed truck \u2026 and another U.S. person to wear a costume portraying Clinton in a prison uniform,\u201d the indictment read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cDefendants and their co-conspirators paid these individuals to complete the requests,\u201d it continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The caged Clinton stunt was a hit among Trump supporters. On Sept. 23, for instance,&lt;a href=\"http://www.nbc-2.com/story/33179442/hillary-clinton-featured-in-cape-coral-cage-display\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; &lt;u&gt;NBC2&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that a Cape Coral man erected a caged Clinton display in his front yard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I feel like I'm doing my little part at least in my little neck of the woods,&amp;quot; homeowner Gary Howd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many GOP operatives who were working in Florida in 2016 don\u2019t recall running across organizations that raised real red flags, some still saw warning signs. Republican consultant and commentator Rick Wilson, for instance, spent months warning about Russian intrusion. And his Tallahassee neighbor, former Republican Party of Florida Executive Director David Johnson, detected something amiss as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt was all the social media stuff, that\u2019s where you could see something was weird,\u201d said Johnson, who consulted for Jeb Bush\u2019s super PAC in 2016. \u201cIt was syntax errors and odd ways of saying things that were apparent.\u201d&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Florida Goes Trump rallies were held in more than 20 cities across the state on Aug. 20, 2016. News releases touting the event were rife with grammatical errors and used language ripped from a traditional Trump stump speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe want to support our candidate and show the whole country that we must unite and make America great again!\u201d read a posting about the rallies. \u201cOn August 20, we want to gather patriots on the start of Floridian towns and cities and march to unite America and support Donald Trump!\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian-linked Facebook group \u201cBeing Patriotic\u201d sent messages to its followers as it was planning the rallies, stressing the importance of winning Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cFlorida is still a purple state and we need to appoint it red,\u201d read the message, according to the indictment. \u201cIf we lose Florida, we lose America.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the rallies, the Russian scheme also used its social media reach to falsely tie Clinton to voter fraud in South Florida, a region with a long history of voting abnormalities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian-linked Twitter accounts on Nov. 2, well into the state\u2019s early-voting period, blasted out a tweet saying voter fraud was occurring because \u201ctens of thousands of ineligible mail in Hillary voters are being reported in Broward County, Florida.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broward County is home to the biggest concentration of registered Democrats in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mueller also said that Russia-linked social media accounts targeted other presidential candidates, including an effort to smear Rubio, though it did not provide specific examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, Rubio indicated that Russians had gone after his campaign staffers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIn July of 2016, shortly after I announced that I would seek reelection to the United States Senate, former members of my presidential campaign team who had access to the internal information of my presidential campaign were targeted by IP addresses with an unknown location within Russia. That effort was unsuccessful,\u201d Rubio said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign manager, Terry Sullivan, said he wasn\u2019t surprised with Russian interference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI feel relatively confident that we were not hacked and nobody had access to our emails and anybody who knows me knows I can say salty things at the time and those would have gotten out,\u201d Sullivan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alberto Martinez, who was Rubio\u2019s chief of staff at the time, also said revelations his boss was targeted are not surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhen you work for someone who is outspoken in condemning the regimes in Moscow, Havana and Beijing, you assume you will be the subject of foreign espionage and influence campaigns,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kyle Cheney contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 00:40:19 GMT</pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>(Marc Caputo)</dc:creator>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/mueller-indictment-russia-florida-interference-416255</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Schiff: Trump \u2018claims vindication anytime someone sneezes\u2019</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/18/schiff-trump-vindication-sneezes-416860</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rep. Adam Schiff jabbed President Donald Trump on Sunday for citing the indictment by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team in its probe of Russian election meddling as proof his campaign had not colluded with foreign operatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d the California Democrat  was asked whether he felt the indictment by Mueller proved that Trump campaign officials had not colluded with Russia, as the president has suggested on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d Schiff replied. \u201cBut this is a president who claims vindication anytime someone sneezes.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president seized on the recent indictment of 13 Russian nationals and three foreign entities to undermine the 2016 presidential election as evidence that his team had not committed any wrongdoing.

The results of the election were not impacted,\u201d Trump tweeted Friday after the indictment was unveiled. \u201cThe Trump campaign did nothing wrong \u2014 no collusion!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schiff criticized Trump for continuing to downplay Russian efforts to meddle in the 2016 campaign, citing the Mueller indictment as conclusive proof of an \u201celaborate\u201d campaign to interfere in the U.S. electoral process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt ought to put to rest for anyone, including the president, who continues to call this a witch hunt, that the evidence is now overwhelming and unequivocal and we need to move to protect ourselves from Russian interference in elections that are coming up,\u201d Schiff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schiff also called on Trump to impose sanctions on Russia passed by Congress in response to Russians' 2016 election meddling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt is inexplicable that the president of the United States continues to sit on sanctions that Congress passed, that Congress wants enforced against Russia over this interference,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThey can\u2019t point the finger back when they\u2019re sitting on sanctions that the Congress, on a very bipartisan basis, said need to be imposed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 15:02:40 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>clima@politico.com (Cristiano Lima)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/18/schiff-trump-vindication-sneezes-416860</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>A caged Clinton and fake \u2018woke blacks\u2019: 9 striking findings from the Mueller indictment</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/mueller-indictment-hillary-clinton-key-findings-415692</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s office on Friday unveiled an indictment against 13 Russian nationals and three foreign entities on charges relating to the 2016 election meddling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indictment, which includes conspiracy to defraud the United States and aggravated identity theft, depicts an elaborate web of initiatives aimed at influencing the presidential race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a look at some of the most startling findings from the Department of Justice announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Russians paid Trump rally-goers to simulate Clinton jailing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the document, the Russian nationals and their associates paid people attending pro-Donald Trump rallies in Florida to carry out numerous \u201ctasks,\u201d including asking one to construct a cage at an event and another to dress up as Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cDefendants and their co-conspirators asked one U.S. person to build a cage on a flatbed truck and another U.S. person to wear a costume portraying Clinton in a prison uniform,\u201d the indictment read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calls for Clinton to be jailed were persistent at Trump rallies throughout 2016, with crowds often breaking out into chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d In&lt;a href=\"http://www.nbc-2.com/story/33179442/hillary-clinton-featured-in-cape-coral-cage-display\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;

One post alluded to Clinton\u2019s foreign policy positions and encouraged people to skip the presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cAmerican Muslims [are] boycotting elections today, most of the American Muslim voters refuse to vote for Hillary Clinton because she wants to continue the war on Muslims in the middle east and voted yes for invading Iraq,\u201d the post states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Instagram post urged voters to \u2018choose peace\u2019 and back Stein&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defendants actively sought to push for third-party candidates like Jill Stein, who ran as the Green Party nominee. They bought an Instagram ad under the user name \u201cBlacktivist,\u201d which supported Stein in early November, according to the indictment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cChoose peace and vote for Jill Stein,\u201d the ad states. \u201cTrust me, it\u2019s not a wasted vote.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stein, who failed to muster substantial support on the campaign trail, faced criticism in 2016 for meeting with President Vladimir Putin of Russia the year prior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate Intelligence Committee began&lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/senate-intel-committee-investigating-jill-stein-campaign-for-collusion-with-the-russians/2017/12/18/ea7f3f1a-e44b-11e7-833f-155031558ff4_story.html?utm_term=.90860618eae3\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; &lt;u&gt;looking into&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the Stein campaign for potential \u201ccollusion with the Russians\u201d in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Russians were actively targeting \u2018purple states\u2019&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defendants aimed their 2016 influence campaign not only along demographic grounds but also geographically, seeking to sway voters in key battleground states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an exchange with a grass-roots organizer in Texas, the indictment alleges, \u201cDefendants and their co-conspirators learned \u2026 that they should focus their activities on \u2018purple states like Colorado, Virginia Florida.\u2019\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their communications, the individuals frequently discussed their efforts to affect \u201cpurple states.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Internet agency behind interference campaign carried upwards of 80 staffers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The election interference efforts outlined in Friday\u2019s indictment were carried out by the Internet Research Agency, an organization with headquarters in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The agency\u2019s U.S. interference operations were referred to as a \u201ctranslator project\u201d with a stated goal of \u201cspread[ing] distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general,\u201d the indictment alleges. By July 2016, the Internet Research Agency had more than 80 people working on its translator project in departments including graphics, search engine optimization, data analysis, finance and information technology, according to Mueller\u2019s team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding for the Internet Research Agency came from the two other entities charged in Friday\u2019s indictment, both of which Mueller\u2019s team said have contracts with the Russian government. In addition to providing funding, a company called Concord Catering and another entity named Concord Management and Consulting LLC \u2014 together referred to by Muller as \u201cConcord\u201d \u2014 also recommended personnel and oversaw the Internet Research Agency\u2019s activities. Funding for the agency was part of a larger Concord program referred to as \u201cProject Lakhta,\u201d which the indictment alleges targeted both foreign and domestic audiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Defendants fretted after FBI \u2018busted\u2019 their efforts, and sought to destroy evidence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Messages exchanged between the defendants and their associates showed that, as federal prosecutors closed in on their efforts to meddle in the election, the Russian nationals sought to cover their tracks by getting rid of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe had a slight crisis here at work: the FBI busted our activity (not a joke),\u201d one defendant wrote to a family member in 2017. \u201cSo, I got preoccupied with covering tracks together with the colleagues.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the exchange, the indictment reads, the defendants \u201cdestroyed evidence for the purpose of impeding the investigation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Louis Nelson contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 21:08:18 GMT</pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>Elizabeth Castillo</dc:creator>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/mueller-indictment-hillary-clinton-key-findings-415692</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Worries about Trump's legitimacy resurface with Russia indictment</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/muller-indictment-trump-election-legitimacy-416163</link>\n      <description>The charges came to no conclusion about voter influence, but described extensive efforts to tip the election in his favor.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;New charges on Friday in the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation put attention squarely on a notion President Donald Trump has aggressively sought to avoid: the legitimacy of his 2016 election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump and the White House were quick to argue that the indictment of 13 Russian nationals further indicated there was no collusion between Russian operatives and the campaign \u2014 and that the vast Russian operation, dubbed \u201cinformation warfare\u201d by the Justice Department, had no impact on the election result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the indictment, like intelligence reports before it, came to no conclusion about the impact of the Russian campaign. And, for the first time, Americans were shown in granular detail how Russian spies worked to sway the election in Trump\u2019s favor, with everything from social media campaigns and ad buys to the organization of rallies and payments to demonstrators dressing up as Hillary Clinton in a cage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indictment, brought by special counsel Robert Mueller, only compounds fears in the White House that Trump will attack the FBI in the wake of a school shooting in Florida that left 17 dead, and revelations that the bureau mishandled a tip about the alleged shooter it received in January. Senior staffers are actively urging Trump to avoid attacking the FBI, one administration official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for Trump, famously furious about the notion that a foreign adversary aided his political rise, the detailed revelation that Russia poured resources toward securing his win could prove an instigation too far. He has frequently railed against the Russia investigation, dismissing it as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and \u201cfake news.\u201d And he has bristled at the notion that Russian interference assisted his upset win over Hillary Clinton, calling the notion a \u201cphony Democrat excuse for losing.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cHe has always been concerned about the legitimacy of his election,\u201d said Rick Tyler, a former communications director for Ted Cruz\u2019s 2016 presidential bid. \u201cThis is criminal activity that these indictments point to that helped Donald Trump get elected. \u2026 My guess is he will try to delegitimize it and dismiss it.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alberto Martinez, Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s chief of staff from 2013 to 2017, said: \u201cThe good news for the Trump campaign in today\u2019s indictment is that there is still no smoking gun on collusion, and that at least in how it pertained to these indictments they were unwitting beneficiaries of Russia\u2019s actions. The bad news is that, at some point, the effort which began as an operation to sow chaos in the entire process turned into an effort to help the Trump campaign. The challenge and opportunity for the Trump administration is to erase any doubt that Putin made a grave mistake in thinking a Trump presidency would somehow benefit Putin\u2019s ambitions.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the White House, there is hope that Trump can be steered away from inflammatory attacks on the special counsel\u2019s findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat needs to happen is someone senior around Trump needs to explain the distinction between Russian meddling and Russian collusion,\u201d said one White House official, voicing fear that Trump will leverage his frequent denials of collusion into a broader effort to dismiss Mueller\u2019s findings that Russia actively interfered in the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cadre of Trump\u2019s senior aides, including White House chief of staff John Kelly, joined the president on Friday as he traveled to Florida for the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Trump has demonstrated a difficulty in the past with accepting any information that raises doubt about his election victory, which he frequently brags about. He still, for example, stands by a claim that Clinton\u2019s popular-vote victory was the result of widespread voter fraud, despite no evidence to support the assertion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump\u2019s retreat into a defensive crouch was quick, as he posted on Twitter Friday afternoon: \u201cRussia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President. The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong \u2014 no collusion!\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House also released a statement from press secretary Sarah Sanders that said there was \u201cNO COLLUSION between the Trump campaign and Russia and that the outcome of the election was not changed or affected.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House statement also included a line from Trump calling for an end to \u201cthe outlandish partisan attacks, wild and false allegations, and far-fetched theories, which only serve to further the agendas of bad actors, like Russia, and do nothing to protect the principles of our institutions.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump\u2019s personal attorney, John Dowd, went so far as to say he was \u201cvery happy,\u201d when asked by POLITICO for his reaction to the Mueller indictment. He did not elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Republicans were eager to note that Russia\u2019s efforts extended beyond Trump cheering and Clinton bashing, noting that the Russians also sought to hurt the campaigns of Sens. Cruz and Rubio and help Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who was vying for the Democratic nomination against Clinton. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf anything, it just showed that they were trying to sow the seeds of discontent,\u201d said Marc Lotter, Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s former press secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But other Republicans were less sanguine about the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe have known that Russians meddled in the election, but these indictments detail the extent of the subterfuge,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement. \u201cThese Russians engaged in a sinister and systematic attack on our political system. It was a conspiracy to subvert the process, and take aim at democracy itself. Today\u2019s announcement underscores why we need to follow the facts and work to protect the integrity of future elections.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nancy Cook and Darren Samuelsohn contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 23:47:53 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>mnussbaum@politico.com (Matthew Nussbaum)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/muller-indictment-trump-election-legitimacy-416163</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>How Russia turned the internet against America</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/how-russia-turned-the-internet-against-america-353707</link>\n      <description>Some who value the online world's freedoms are 'at a loss' after Friday's indictment offered new details about how trolls exploited its weaknesses.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The indictment released Friday by special counsel Robert Mueller makes plain how prosecutors believe Russia pursued its multiyear scheme to undermine the 2016 presidential election \u2014 by wielding the social media-driven internet that the United States itself did so much to create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They had help, digital experts say, from decades of accepted U.S. policy about how to help the internet thrive: The U.S. government has taken a largely hands-off approach, while the anonymity that protects people's privacy and liberty online also allowed Russian trolls to deceive overly trusting Americans. And the same freedom to innovate that has made Silicon Valley wealthy and powerful meant that there were few eyes on the ball as Russian actors began figuring out how to manipulate the internet's few dominant platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter and the Google-owned YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So many of us thought for so long that the internet was an unbridled force for good, but man, over the last year, the shine has really come off,&amp;quot; said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy &amp;amp; Technology, a D.C.-based tech advocacy group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I\u2019m sort of at a loss right now,&amp;quot; Hall added. &amp;quot;I value anonymity, but it\u2019s really hard to see how this doesn\u2019t lead to some sort of driver\u2019s license for the internet, which makes me feel horrible. There needs to be some sort of accountability, though I really don\u2019t know what that is. We have a lot of work to do.\u201d&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jonathan Albright, an expert on bots and online propaganda, also found the conclusions of Mueller's investigators stunning and sobering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe indictment is unbelievable,\u201d said Albright, who's also a research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism. He pointed in particular to a section detailing how the major social media companies did not share evidence of Russian spending on political or social ads until September 2017, some 10 months after the presidential election. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;He blames, in part, Silicon Valley\u2019s insularity. \u201cIf there was more transparency and accountability into these systems, researchers might have been able to pre-empt some of what happened. But these companies don\u2019t answer to anyone except shareholders,\u201d Albright said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there\u2019s plenty more responsibility to go around, argues Albright. Government officials, for example, have failed to pass the sort of campaign finance disclosure or data privacy laws or rules that could make it more difficult to target Americans online. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was not supposed to happen this way. For years, American tech evangelists and U.S. government leaders alike saw the free-flowing internet as a threat to global strongmen, including Russia's Vladimir Putin, who favor tight controls. U.S. policymakers have often espoused the idea that dictators would be so tempted by digital commerce's economic bounty that they would eventually relent and allow the internet to operate without censorship. It was an article of faith in the Obama administration that, as then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton &lt;a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/a/clinton-warns-efforts-to-curb-internet-will-backfire-116246729/174544.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in 2011, \u201cgovernments who have erected barriers to Internet freedom ... will eventually find themselves boxed in.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Russian authorities, Mueller\u2019s indictment suggests, had other ideas \u2014 even as they adopted many of Silicon Valley's best practices and turned them against U.S. democracy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The notorious Russian troll farm known as the Internet Research Agency, the document details, has been organized like a well-tuned digital marketing shop. It had a division dedicated to search-engine optimization, the art and&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;science of persuading the algorithms that power Google and other websites to prominently feature certain content. The indictment says the Russian outfit also used data analytics to track which of their posts were proving most successful, sent private social media messages to stir up genuinely American grass-roots activists and registered accounts \u2014 with names like &amp;quot;staceyredneck@gmail.com&amp;quot; \u2014 on PayPal to pay for ads. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The organization even double-checked the content generated by its posting \u201cspecialists\u201d to make sure it had the kind of authenticity to make it believable to Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tech companies have been reluctant to embrace the idea that their actions, or inactions, might have made life easier for the Russian actors. Just last month, Facebook\u2019s product manager for civic engagement, Samidh Chakrabarti, made news &lt;a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/01/effect-social-media-democracy/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;by saying of Russian social media meddling&lt;/a&gt;, \u201cThis was a new kind of threat that was hard to predict, but we should have.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ren&amp;eacute;e DiResta, an advisor for the newly launched Center for Humane Technology \u2014 a group of tech industry veterans critical of what social media has done to society \u2014 tweeted, \u201cWhile you read the Mueller #Indictment remember the tech CEO mantra: 'We don\u2019t want to be the arbiters of truth.' These platforms were used &lt;i&gt;exactly as they were designed to be used&lt;/i&gt;. Here we are a year later, and still no accountability or governance.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, though, some in tech grumble that they haven\u2019t gotten the kind of government help that the industry might have needed to combat the foreign interference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Mueller indictment came out Friday, Joel Kaplan, the vice president of global policy at Facebook, said in a statement that the company was \u201cgrateful\u201d that government authorities were taking \u201caggressive action against those who abused our service and exploited the openness of our democratic process.\u201d  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan, too, emphasized that Facebook now believes it needs to do more to combat whatever attacks might come. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to staying ahead of this kind of deceptive and malevolent activity going forward,\u201d he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter said in a statement Friday night that it will continue to cooperate with Congress' and Mueller's investigations into the election meddling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Russian efforts to disrupt the 2016 U.S. election, in part by abusing social media platforms, go against everything we at Twitter believe,&amp;quot; a Twitter spokesperson said. &amp;quot;Any activity of this kind is intolerable, and we all must do more to prevent it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in light of the details laid out in the Mueller materials, the American people are not finding themselves off the hook either. If anonymity has merits on the internet, experts say, users still have the job of making smart decisions about whom to listen to or not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indictment describes how the Russian outfit used a made-up persona of \u201cMatt Skiber\u201d to correspond with a Texas grass-roots political group about the organization's offline rallies. It also cites one Internet Research Agency staffer who in an email to a relative described how she \u201ccreated all these pictures and posts, and the Americans believed it was written by their people.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein tsk-tsked during his Friday news conference, \u201cthis indictment serves as a reminder that people are not always who they appear to be on the internet.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even perhaps Silicon Valley\u2019s harshest critic of late in Washington, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), responded to the Mueller indictment in part by pointing the finger at the American population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhile platforms like Facebook and Twitter are allowing Americans to communicate and share ideas in ways unimaginable just a decade ago,&amp;quot; said the Senate Intelligence Committee vice chairman, &amp;quot;we\u2019re also learning that we each bear some responsibility for exercising good judgment and a healthy amount of skepticism when it comes to the things we read and share on social media.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Darren Samuelsohn and Ashley Gold contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 01:28:02 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>nscola@politico.com (Nancy Scola)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/how-russia-turned-the-internet-against-america-353707</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>How the Watergate Scandal Almost Had a Different Name</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/18/how-the-watergate-scandal-almost-had-a-different-name-217016</link>\n      <description>The Democratic National Committee was broke and almost evicted from its office space. But someone stepped in at the last minute.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the third and final edition of his landmark dictionary of American politics, the longtime political pundit William Safire listed more than a dozen scandals with the \u201c-gate\u201d construction, including &lt;i&gt;Winegate&lt;/i&gt; (dealing with the adulteration of Bordeaux wines), &lt;i&gt;Koreagate&lt;/i&gt; (corruption of members of Congress by South Korean lobbyist Tongsun Park and the South Korean CIA), &lt;i&gt;Irangate &lt;/i&gt;(the Iran-Contra affair), &lt;i&gt;travelgate &lt;/i&gt;(the White House travel staff dismissed in the early days of the Clinton administration), &lt;i&gt;rubbergate &lt;/i&gt;(bounced checks at a bank in the U.S. House of Representatives) and &lt;i&gt;scalpgate &lt;/i&gt;(the delay of Air Force One at Los Angeles International Airport while President Clinton received a $200 haircut).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the -gate suffix is still used to describe many a political scandal. But at the time of the break-in, the Democratic National Committee was barely hanging on to its tony Foggy Bottom digs. Deeply indebted and falling behind on rent, the DNC was almost evicted from the Watergate building just as the 1972 election was taking off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the story of how the Watergate scandal almost took place somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;As the 1968 election approached, &lt;/b&gt;John Bailey, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, learned from his landlord that the rent on the committee\u2019s K Street offices was going to be hiked significantly. \u201cWe need to find another space,\u201d Bailey told his administrative assistant, R. Spencer Oliver, who began reaching out to real estate agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, Oliver\u2019s phone rang. It was Giuseppe Cecchi, an executive who had been placed in charge of his Italian real estate company\u2019s \u201cFoggy Bottom project,\u201d a dramatic complex of buildings that would eventually be named the Watergate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cecchi\u2019s employer, &lt;i&gt;Societa\u0300 generale immobiliare di lavori di utilita\u0300 pubblica ed agricola&lt;/i&gt; (in English, \u201cGeneral Building Society of Works of Public and Agricultural Utility\u201d), was the largest real estate development and construction firm in Italy. In the media, the firm was usually identified as either Societ&amp;agrave; Generale Immobiliare or by its initials, SGI. The largest single shareholder in the firm was the Vatican; four of the twelve directors had close ties to the Vatican, including a nephew of the late Pope Pius XII.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cecchi went to work at SGI\u2019s Milan office and soon landed in the project-planning department of SGI\u2019s headquarters in Rome after university, where he learned about the company\u2019s aggressive plans to expand into the rest of Europe and into North America. He applied for a transfer to the U.S., got it and immediately set about closing deals to prove himself in his new role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI understand you\u2019re looking for office space,\u201d Cecchi told Oliver. \u201cCome to the Watergate.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oliver was reluctant. At the time, taxi rates in Washington were determined by the number of zones crossed per ride. The Watergate was two taxi zones away from the DNC\u2019s current office, which meant more expensive cab rides to and from the Capitol. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty far from the center of town,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cecchi pressed Oliver to come over and take a tour. They stood in the center of the sixth floor of the office building. There were no walls, just support columns and a sweeping view of the Potomac River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe\u2019ll design it for you however you want it to be,\u201d Cecchi promised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oliver sensed Cecchi desperately needed tenants for the new office building. \u201cI\u2019m in negotiations already with a couple other places,\u201d Oliver said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe can beat any offer you have,\u201d Cecchi insisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Oliver got back to the office, he popped in to see Bailey. \u201cI think they\u2019re gonna make us a deal,\u201d Oliver said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cecchi sent over a proposal. He offered the DNC the entire sixth floor of the Watergate Office Building, with the potential to expand into another floor during presidential campaigns, plus another suite&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;on the ground floor for the new DNC computers. Next door, in the Watergate Hotel, Cecchi included a three-bedroom hospitality suite upstairs, overlooking the Potomac, for only $300 a month. (Separately he leased a dining room, kitchen and office on the B-2 level for the National Democratic Club.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe\u2019ll never raise the rent,\u201d Cecchi promised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bailey took the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 1, 1967, the Watergate Hotel opened to the public. Hotel rooms\u2014called \u201capartments\u201d in the press release\u2014could be rented by the month or by the day. Two-bedroom \u201cpresidential suites\u201d were available for $900 per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Watergate Office Building\u2014\u201cplanned and constructed to meet the special needs of Washington\u2019s many trade associations, professional firms, and non-profit and charitable organizations\u201d\u2014opened the same day. According to a press release, the office building was \u201cmore restrained in its design\u201d than the hotel and apartments and was the only building \u201cwithout sweeping balconies.\u201d The Watergate Office Building\u2019s only outdoor space was the terrace on the sixth floor\u2014the new home of the Democratic National Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 20, 1967, President and Mrs. Johnson attended the open house at the DNC\u2019s new Watergate offices. Bailey showed the president the basement computer room. Upstairs, Lady Bird Johnson admired the view, but expressed concerns about the 220-foot-high smokestacks that marred the otherwise picture-postcard view of Georgetown from DNC vice chairman Margaret Price\u2019s office. The first lady was in the midst of a national beautification initiative and was happy to learn the unsightly structures were about to come down. Nobody told her a freeway would replace them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the party faithful were \u201cuneasy, even sheepish,\u201d as they tried to reconcile the new offices\u2014with their wall-to-wall carpeting, art-and-tapestry-lined walls, pastel push-button telephones and a \u201cVIP Room\u201d with a built-in sink and refrigerator\u2014with the \u201cCommon Man image of the New Deal, the Fair Deal and the Great Society,\u201d the &lt;i&gt;Washington Star &lt;/i&gt;reported. \u201cIt looks like Republican headquarters,\u201d observed Johnson\u2019s labor secretary Willard Wirtz, only half in jest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cNothing\u2019s too good for the party of the people,\u201d said Associate Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One unnamed official said the DNC was able to get the \u201cplush\u201d suite at a good rate because building management had failed to anticipate the robust demand for office space in the new building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Committee staff members had numbers at the ready to defend the move: The new offices contained 20 percent more floor space (5,000 to 6,000 feet) and cost $7,000 a month\u2014$100 less than the monthly rent on K St. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;i&gt;Miami Herald&lt;/i&gt;, \u201cThe music is soft and piped. The girls looked like they escaped from a James Bond movie. There\u2019s a great view of the Potomac, too. Real or contrived, happiness pervades the sixth-floor ultra-modern suite.\u201d&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The DNC\u2019s new offices&lt;/b&gt; might not have been more expensive than its previous home, but the committee had trouble&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;making their rent anyway.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Behind the curtain, the Democratic Party was broke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 1970, 18 months after Richard Nixon narrowly defeated Hubert Humphrey to become the 37th president of the United States, Robert S. Strauss was elected treasurer of the DNC and began dealing with a flood of creditors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DNC\u2019s total debt in 1970 was $9.5 million, including $7 million from the Humphrey primary and general campaigns, and $1 million of the late senator Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s primary campaign debt. \u201cI would be less than candid,\u201d Strauss wrote one creditor, \u201cif I did not say to you that the Committee has absolutely no funds on hand for debt payment right now.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 14-page list of DNC creditors, now stored at the National Archives, shows the committee owed General Dynamics Corporation $33,211.14 for office space leased to the Humphrey Committee at 1025 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.; $19,755.15 to the Shoreham Hotel; $33,329.10 to the Waldorf Astoria; $48,246.03 to Emery Air Freight and $38,477.70 to the Hertz rental car corporation. The National Archives file also shows a balance of $10,452.48 owed to \u201cWatergate Improvement Assoc.,\u201d managers of the Watergate Office Building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giuseppe Cecchi was Italian by birth, but he considered himself \u201cfully Americanized.\u201d He wanted to send the DNC an eviction notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d a colleague asked him. \u201cMcGovern may be the next president of the United States. You don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But hindsight is 20/20, and Cecchi was overruled. The DNC could stay, he was informed by his superiors, and any past-due rent could be collected after the election. No eviction proceedings were begun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the morning of Saturday, June 17, 1972, Cecchi received a call from a Watergate manager, who informed him there had been a break-in at the DNC\u2019s offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Democrats eventually settled with their creditors. Strauss and DNC chairman Larry O\u2019Brien established the Democratic National Committee Telethon Trust in 1972 to retire all outstanding debts of the DNC and distribute any excess funds to the committee and to state party committees. The telethon, which took place on July 8 and 9, 1972, netted $2 million. Strauss was able to pay some bills in full. He asked other creditors to accept 25 cents on the dollar. A check for $2,500 was sent to the Watergate on July 18, 1973\u2014by coincidence, the day president Nixon ordered aides to disconnect the White House taping system.&lt;br /&gt;Had the Democrats been evicted from the sixth floor of the Watergate Office Building, as Giuseppe Cecchi requested, they presumably would have remained a target of Gordon Liddy, Howard Hunt and the other Watergate burglars\u2014but in some other location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the Watergate might be known today as a mid-century masterpiece of Italian design\u2014synonymous with luxury and privacy\u2014not scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 12:27:51 GMT</pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>Joseph Rodota</dc:creator>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/18/how-the-watergate-scandal-almost-had-a-different-name-217016</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Florida shooting survivors announce national march against gun violence</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/18/florida-shooting-march-gun-violence-416863</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Five survivors of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida announced plans on Sunday for a nationwide march, as well as a demonstration in Washington to call for legislative action to prevent gun violence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a spate of TV appearances Sunday morning, students Jaclyn Corin, Emma Gonzalez, David Hogg, Cameron Kasky and Alex Wind unveiled plans to mobilize students to urge lawmakers to act in response to Wednesday's fatal shooting in Parkland, Florida, that claimed the lives of 17 of their fellow classmates and school staffers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We're marching because it's not just schools. It's movie theaters, it's concerts, it's nightclubs,&amp;quot; Wind told NBC's &amp;quot;Meet the Press.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;This kind of stuff can't just happen. You know, we are marching for our lives, we're marching for the 17 lives we lost. And we're marching for our children's lives and our children's children and their children.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The national demonstration, set to take place March 24, will feature calls for lawmakers to take up legislative remedies to improve mental health and expand regulations on guns, the students said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I will not feel safe going back to school myself until reasonable mental health care legislation and gun control legislation is passed,&amp;quot; Hogg told NBC. &amp;quot;Because, at this point, it's unacceptable.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The students also issued a warning to lawmakers that continue to receive funding from the National Rifle Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;These people who are being funded by the NRA are not going to be allowed to remain in office when midterm elections roll around,&amp;quot; Gonzalez said. &amp;quot;They're going to be voted out of office. Incumbency rates are going to drop.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a fiery rebuke of President Donald Trump, one student also took exception to the president questioning &amp;quot;why didn\u2019t the Democrats pass gun control legislation&amp;quot; when they controlled both houses of Congress on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You are in that exact position right now, and you want to look back on our history and blame the Democrats? That's disgusting,&amp;quot; Hogg said. &amp;quot;You're the President. You're supposed to bring this nation together, not divide us. How dare you. Children are dying, and their blood is on your hands because of that. Please take action. Stop going on vacation in Mar-a-Lago. Take action.

Bush and Barack Obama, predicted that Mueller's team had yet to fully reveal their findings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I do think there are other shoes to drop here besides this indictment,&amp;quot; Clapper told Dana Bash on CNN's &amp;quot;State of the Union.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Pressed on what additional findings Mueller's team of federal prosecutors might unearth, Clapper suggested that we'd yet to see the full extent of the involvement of the Russian government in efforts to undermine the U.S. electoral process.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For example, not addressed here is potential involvement of the Russian government, which we certainly saw through intelligence channels that the Russians were \u2014 government was \u2014 was masterminding this,&amp;quot; Clapper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clapper cited the financial dealings of the Trump Organization as another potential avenue for federal investigators. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I think another thing that we haven't seen much of is financial entanglements between the Trump Organization before the election and then during it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clapper, who led U.S. intelligence efforts from 2010 to 2017, cast the Russian campaign to interfere with the 2016 elections as &amp;quot;unprecedented.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Never before have we seen an effort like this mounted by the Russians with the multidimensional nature of it and its aggressiveness and directness,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 16:29:44 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>clima@politico.com (Cristiano Lima)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/18/clapper-mueller-russia-probe-white-house-416865</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Limbaugh: \u2018We need concealed carry\u2019 in schools</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/18/limbaugh-guns-schools-concealed-carry-416864</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh called for concealed carry in U.S. schools on Sunday in response to the deadly shooting at a Florida high school that killed 17 and injured several others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe solution is we need concealed carry in these schools,\u201d Limbaugh said during an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cIf we\u2019re not going to take action, we better have mechanisms in these schools to stop it when it breaks out.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratic officials and some Republicans responded to the fatal shooting in Parkland, Florida, on Wednesday by calling for tighter regulations on guns. But many Republican leaders have downplayed the need for additional laws, with President Donald Trump and other officials instead emphasizing the need for mental health reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Limbaugh suggested Sunday that to prevent more mass casualties, open concealed carry laws should be extended on school campuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf we don\u2019t do that, then all the rest of this is nothing more than political posturing for the 2018 midterms and the 2020 election,\u201d Limbaugh said of the measure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limbaugh and other right-wing commentators in the past have suggested that if school officials or students were armed that casualties during mass shootings could be reduced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suspected shooter Nikolas Cruz confessed to opening fire on students and staffers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, according to a police report released Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suspected shooter, authorities said, used an AR-15 assault-style rifle during his deadly spree. &lt;br /&gt;He has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The onslaught marked the 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; mass shooting in 2018 so far, according to the Gun Violence Archive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measures to expand gun regulations have repeatedly stalled in Congress, facing strong opposition in the GOP-controlled House and Senate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 16:32:04 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>clima@politico.com (Cristiano Lima)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/18/limbaugh-guns-schools-concealed-carry-416864</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>TRUMP SUNDAY TWEETSTORM -- MORE FROM FLORIDA: Students plan Washington rally -- RYAN, TRUMP to talk 2018 legislative agenda -- MCCONNELL on MITT ROMNEY -- B\u2019DAY: Marc Lampkin</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2018/02/18/trump-sunday-tweetstorm-more-from-florida-students-plan-washington-rally-ryan-trump-to-talk-2018-legislative-agenda-mcconnell-on-mitt-romney-bday-marc-lampkin-249435</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE PRESIDENT\u2019S WEEK AHEAD -- TUESDAY: &lt;/b&gt;Trump will have lunch with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.

Thank you Adam!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;-- AND FROM LAST NIGHT -- @realDonaldTrump&lt;/b&gt; at 11:22 p.m.: \u201cGeneral McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NYT\u2019S PETER BAKER: &lt;/b&gt;\u201cIn 13 months in office, Mr. Trump has made little if any public effort to rally the nation to confront Moscow for its intrusion or to defend democratic institutions against continued disruption. His administration has at times called out Russia or taken action, and even Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, speaking in Germany on Saturday, called evidence of Russian meddling \u2018incontrovertible.\u2019 But the administration has been left to respond without the president\u2019s leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;\u201c\u2018It is astonishing to me that a president &lt;/b&gt;of the United States would take this so lightly or see it purely through the prism of domestic partisanship,\u2019 said Daniel Fried, a career diplomat under presidents of both parties who is now at the Atlantic Council. He said it invariably raised questions about whether Mr. Trump had something to hide. \u2018I have no evidence that he\u2019s deliberately pulling his punches because he has to, but I can\u2019t dismiss it. No president has raised those kinds of questions.\u2019\u201d &lt;a href=\"http://nyti.ms/2EQXclh\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;http://nyti.ms/2EQXclh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;REP.

GOP sources tell us that there\u2019s little proactive strategizing happening in the West Wing and at the agencies to drive any legislative push before the midterm elections. While Trump has been publicly pushing his infrastructure plan, GOP and Democratic insiders don\u2019t expect that to go anywhere. And talk of some kind of overhaul to the country\u2019s welfare system is privately met with nervous laughter and unease. GOP political operatives would like their congressional counterparts to focus on one thing -- selling tax reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE SENATE\u2019S FAILURE &lt;/b&gt;to pass immigration legislation last week should not go unnoticed. It\u2019s the one issue that both Republicans and Democrats say they want to fix -- and something both parties expect will be a major issue at the ballot box this fall. But the road to finding a solution to so-called Dreamers just got more complicated as it\u2019s now up to the House to try and resolve it in a highly partisan environment. &lt;b&gt;IN THE HOUSE, &lt;/b&gt;It\u2019s hard to see Democrats agree to anything House Republicans put on the floor -- especially given where the debate has been focused in recent days. &lt;b&gt;THE TRUMP EFFECT &lt;/b&gt;is real here. Congressional Republicans want to pass something that could actually get signed into law. It\u2019s still unclear exactly what deal Trump would take. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;BREAKING -- \u201cCommercial plane crashes in southern Iran, killing 66 people,\u201d &lt;/b&gt;by AP\u2019s Nasser Karimi in Tehran and Jon Gambrell: \u201cAn Iranian commercial plane crashed on Sunday in a foggy, mountainous region of southern Iran, killing all 66 people on board, state media reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;\u201cAn Aseman Airlines ATR-72,&lt;/b&gt; a twin-engine turboprop used for short-distance regional flying, went down near its destination of the southern Iranian city of Yasuj, some 780 kilometers (485 miles) south of the Iranian capital, Tehran.

The problem is not owning an AR-15, is the person that owns it. Again, you not go back to the how of what particular weapon is chosen, it's the why. I have individuals in my neighborhood that own an AR-15. That doesn't make it a dangerous neighborhood or them dangerous individuals. It's the individual themself becomes the issue, not the weapon that they're holding.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TODD: &lt;/b&gt;\u201cWell, I understand. But it seems as if the gap here is that it is still too easy to purchase one. Should it be much harder to purchase an AR-15?\u201d &lt;b&gt;LANKFORD: &lt;/b&gt;\u201cI actually don't think it should be. I think what should be is difficult for any person with any kind of criminal background history, domestic violence, mental instability, all of those things, regardless. I don't care whether they're buying a 22 pistol or an AR-15.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;-- A BREAK ON THE NRA\u2019S HOLD ON CONGRESS? -- FLORIDA REPUBLICAN REP.

Given the widespread nature of wage theft and the dearth of resources to combat it, most cases go unreported. Thus, an estimated $15 billion in desperately needed income for workers with lowest wages goes instead into the pockets of shady bosses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; \u201cBut even those workers who are able to brave the system and win &lt;/b&gt;\u2014 to get states to order their bosses to pay them what they\u2019re owed -- confront a further barrier: Fully 41 percent of the wages that employers are ordered to pay back to their workers aren\u2019t recovered, according to a POLITICO survey of 15 states.\u201d &lt;a href=\"http://politi.co/2CtLtDZ\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;http://politi.co/2CtLtDZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE RUSSIA REPORT -- \u201cThe 21st-century Russian sleeper agent is a troll with an American accent,\u201d &lt;/b&gt;by WaPo\u2019s Anton Troianovski, Ros Helderman, Ellen Nakashima and Craig Timberg: \u201cNot long after Marat Mindiyarov started working at the Internet Research Agency, the Russian troll factory indicted by the U.S. Justice Department on Friday, he began hearing about the coveted \u2018Facebook Department.\u2019 There, workers could earn more money and work alongside a younger, hipper crowd. But to gain entry, job candidates had to prove they could seamlessly insinuate themselves into the American political conversation.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The English-language test, which Mindiyarov said he took in December 2014, included a question about vegetarianism and another about Hillary Clinton and the prospect that the Democratic front-runner would win the U.S. presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;\u201cMindiyarov, 43 and a teacher by training, wrote that Clinton&lt;/b&gt; had a good chance of winning, and that it would be a remarkable feat, making her the country\u2019s first female president. \u2018You didn\u2019t pass the test,\u2019 the woman who administered the exam told him later that day, he said, although it wasn\u2019t clear if his shortcoming was imperfect English or failing to bash Clinton. Either way, Mindiyarov remained stuck with the less-glamorous job of commenting on articles posted to Russian websites and quit three months later from a job he compared to something from \u20181984,\u2019 the dystopian novel by George Orwell. \u2018Your first feeling, when you ended up there, was that you were in some kind of factory that turned lying, telling untruths, into an industrial assembly line,\u2019 Mindiyarov said.\u201d &lt;a href=\"http://wapo.st/2o5ndUr\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;http://wapo.st/2o5ndUr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OLD SCHOOL -- \u201cFacebook plans to use U.S. mail to verify IDs of election ad buyers,\u201d &lt;/b&gt;by Reuters\u2019 Dustin Volz: \u201cFacebook Inc will start using postcards sent by U.S. mail later this year to verify the identities and location of people who want to purchase U.S. election-related advertising on its site, a senior company executive said on Saturday. ...

Over the next four years, he employed an unconventional, anachronistic management style that upended the newspaper\u2019s culture and made many female workers uncomfortable, according to more than a dozen current and former employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;\u201cDuring the taping of a promotional video,&lt;/b&gt; Manchester once pulled a reporter in for a hug so intimate that it startled onlookers in the newsroom, multiple people said. He complimented young female employees on their looks, and he and other senior managers required some of them hired for a new in-house television operation to wear short black dresses and serve as hostesses for advertisers and other guests at Union-Tribune events, current and former employees said. And he once asked an on-air program host to dye her hair platinum blond, complaining that her roots were showing.\u201d &lt;a href=\"http://wapo.st/2GqMjDJ\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;http://wapo.st/2GqMjDJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;BEYOND THE BELTWAY -- \u201cEx-Clinton aide makes mystery bid for California governor,\u201d &lt;/b&gt;by California Playbookers David Siders and Carla Marinucci in Los Angeles: \u201cAmanda Renteria, the former top Hillary Clinton campaign aide who baffled Democrats when she filed paperwork recently to run for California governor, still isn\u2019t talking.

Get smart America!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump also sought to push back on reports that he has never explicitly agreed with the U.S. intelligence community and others who have said for months now that Russia meddled in the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I never said Russia did not meddle in the election, I said \u201cit may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer,&amp;quot; the president wrote on Twitter two days after special counsel Robert Mueller and his team announced the&lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/trump-russia-indictments-mueller-investigation-415667\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; indictment of Russia nationals&lt;/a&gt; for meddling in the 2016 election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added:  &amp;quot;The Russian 'hoax' was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia \u2014 it never did!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump's tweet pointed to an exchange &lt;a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/12/12/505261053/13-times-russian-hacking-came-up-in-the-presidential-campaign\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;during the first presidential debate&lt;/a&gt; in which he questioned the U.S. intelligence committee's&lt;a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; early finding &lt;/a&gt; that Russia was behind a hack of the Democratic National Committee and the private emails of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC,&amp;quot; he said at the time. &amp;quot;She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't \u2014 maybe it was.

It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK? You don't know who broke in to DNC.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As president, Trump continued his trend of begrudgingly avoiding an explicit public backing of the idea that Russian interfered in the election, including  emphasizing that he pressed Russian Vladimir Putin about the subject and that the former KGB agent &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/09/trump-putin-russia-cyber-security-240327\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&amp;quot;vehemently denied it.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In later tweets, Trump returned to another one of his favorite foils in Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who is the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, one of the Capitol Hill panels tasked with digging into the scope of Russia's actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Finally, Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff, the leakin\u2019 monster of no control, is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election,&amp;quot; the president wrote on Twitter. &amp;quot;He is finally right about something.

The FBI announced after Wednesday's shooting at Marjory Douglas Stoneman High School in Parkland that it failed to follow up on a tip it received in January about the accused gunman, Nikolas Cruz, which included information about Cruz's &amp;quot;gun ownership, desire to kill people and erratic behavior.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturday's tweet is far from the first time that Trump has suggested curtailing, or even ending the Russia investigation, which he has repeatedly called a &amp;quot;witch hunt.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Mueller's team announced that a federal grand jury had indicted 13 Russian nationals for illegal election activity. The indictment goes into particular detail about how the Russians visited the U.S. and sought to gain insight into America's domestic politics before orchestrating a disinformation campaign aimed at sowing discord and boosting Trump's chances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the president, Trump's national security adviser H.R. McMaster was emphatic   Saturday that the most recent indictment leaves no doubt that Russia meddled in the election, saying &amp;quot;the evidence is incontrovertible and available in the public domain.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a later tweet, Trump said that McMaster forgot to mention that the Russian interference has no influence on the outcome of the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems,&amp;quot; Trump wrote on Twitter. &amp;quot;Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday's indictment did not reach a conclusion on whether or not Russian actions might have changed the outcome of the election in any way, nor did it guarantee that further legal action against the president or members of his campaign might not occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 11:46:31 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>bgriffiths@politico.com (Brent D.

Trump himself &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/964594780088033282\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;celebrated&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, saying that Mueller\u2019s showed that his campaign \u201cdid nothing wrong - no collusion!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But veterans of criminal investigations said the president\u2019s celebration may be premature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the indictment says three Trump campaign officials may have played \u201cunwitting\u201d roles in the specific Russian election interference it describes, the document draws no broader conclusions about any potential Trump campaign ties to the Kremlin \u2014 which has been alleged to take many different forms beyond the focus of Friday\u2019s charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And they noted that Mueller\u2019s latest move appears to establish the critical basis to charge American co-conspirators in the Russian election effort. Before Friday, it was unclear what crimes any U.S. persons might have been aiding or abetting. Now, a legal framework exists for criminal charges against Americans \u2014 including ones who do not show up in Friday\u2019s court document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indictment mentions conspirators both known and &amp;quot;unknown&amp;quot; to the grand jury, legal experts noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis language is purposeful,\u201d said Elizabeth de la Vega, a former assistant U.S. attorney from the Northern District of California. \u201cIt unmistakably indicates there is much more to the story.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThink of a conspiracy indicting parties &lt;b&gt;\u2018&lt;/b&gt;known and unknown\u2019 as a Matroyshka doll,\u201d she added. \u201cThere are many more layers to be successively revealed over time.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joyce Vance, a former U.S. Attorney from Northern Alabama, said Mueller\u2019s indictment now sends the signal that he believes it\u2019s a federal crime for a foreign national to try and interfere in a U.S. election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat means any American who met with Russians in an effort to receive election assistance, also committed a crime,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd any efforts to cover that conduct up would be a very serious obstruction of justice.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mueller\u2019s indictment also puts an exclamation point on findings from the U.S. intelligence community that Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 election, both to disrupt the U.S. political system and out of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/clinton-putin-226153\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;longstanding animus&lt;/a&gt; for Clinton. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on those findings \u2014 Trump said during one October 2016 presidential debate that the hackers stealing Democratic emails \u201ccould be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds\u201d \u2014 the indictment presented evidence specific enough to form the basis of federal criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cFrankly, Trump is the only one who says there\u2019s no meddling. This lays it out chapter and verse,\u201d said Peter Zeidenberg, a former federal prosecutor who served as a deputy to the mid-2000s federal investigation into the leak of former CIA operative Valerie Plame\u2019s identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several Democrats said Friday that Mueller\u2019s latest indictment should put to rest claims that the notion of Russian election interference is some kind of hoax, and freshly underscores the need for Mueller to complete his investigation with full political independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump himself is under investigation for his attempts to tamp down the original probe, including the May 2017 firing of FBI Director James Comey \u2014 a move which prompted Rosensetein to appoint Mueller. More than 20 current and former White House aides have already met with Mueller as part of his wider inquiry \u2013 former Trump strategist Steven Bannon &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/15/steve-bannon-scripted-questions-russia-probe-414755\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;had&lt;/a&gt; multiple interviews earlier this week with the special counsel \u2014&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;and Mueller is seeking to ask Trump himself about the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates are facing multiple charges \u2014 including money laundering and failing to register as foreign agents for lobbying work unrelated to the 2016 election. The federal judge overseeing the case has suggested a trial could start in the fall, though it\u2019s unclear if that will happen. CNN reported on Thursday that Gates is talking with Mueller\u2019s office about a plea deal in exchange for his cooperation. POLITICO has not been able to independently confirm that report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday\u2019s shift to the Russians\u2019 social media campaign to influence voter behavior is unlikely to play out in the same way as the Manafort-Gates case given the defendants are all foreign nationals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cHow are you actually going to do anything against these guys if they all stay hidden in Russia?\u201d said Clint Watts, a former FBI agent and expert on Russian disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mueller\u2019s rollout Friday also came with an added wrinkle: a rare press conference to announce the charges from Rosenstein, the No. 2 official at DOJ who has supervising authority over Mueller and the whole Russia case. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the investigation after charges that he provided inaccurate accounts of his contacts with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. while serving as a key surrogate and adviser for the 2016 Trump campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has fumed over Rosenstein\u2019s handing of the Russia investigation. But the optics of Friday\u2019s press conference showed the deputy attorney general squarely in charge of the investigation. They also aligned with Rosenstein\u2019s previous claims that he was aware of and closely monitoring the special counsel investigation, which some Republican critics have portrayed as unmanaged and out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe window for Trump to fire Mueller or Rosenstein is now closed,\u201d de la Vega said. \u201cIt is painted shut.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Randall Samborn, a former assistant U.S. attorney and spokesman on the Plame investigation, said he is not convinced that the deputy attorney general\u2019s job is safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; \u201cIt could cut either way,\u201d Samborn said. \u201cIt gives them protection from naysayers on Capitol Hill but it may even put him in more jeopardy in the eyes of the president and his allies, who now see him in concert with Mueller. You can see this as both helping and hurting the longevity at the same time.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they digested Friday\u2019s findings, Democrats and legal experts said it had piqued their interest in what other Americans might turn up in what are presumed to be more indictments on the way from the special counsel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe next step obviously is for the grand jury to decide whether there were any U.S. persons who are part of the conspiracy,\u201d said Jeffress, who represented I. Lewis \u201cScooter\u201d Libby, a senior George W. Bush White House aide ultimately charged in the Plame case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI suspect their names will be known to us soon,\u201d New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Josh Gerstein contributed reporting.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 01:51:04 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>dsamuelsohn@politico.com (Darren Samuelsohn)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/mueller-indictment-russia-information-warfare-416378</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Key takeaways from the Russia indictment</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/mueller-indictment-russia-takeaways-353667</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Russian scheme to sway the 2016 U.S. presidential election was a plot years in the making \u2014 an expensive effort that cost millions of dollars and employed as many as hundreds of people, the&lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/trump-russia-indictments-mueller-investigation-415667\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; federal indictment&lt;/a&gt; unsealed Friday alleges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; lays out a breathtaking influence operation that sent Russian operatives to the U.S., sought American activists\u2019 advice about targeting swing states, staged rallies on U.S. soil and wielded the United States\u2019 homegrown social media platforms to worsen the country\u2019s racial, religious and political divides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while the indictment doesn\u2019t explicitly name Vladimir Putin as one of the conspirators, it meshes with U.S. intelligence agencies\u2019 January 2017 conclusion that the Russian leader had \u201cordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election,\u201d an effort that eventually \u201cdeveloped a clear preference\u201d for the election of Donald Trump.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The operators even made contact with \u201cunwitting individuals in Trump\u2019s campaign,\u201d the indictment says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are several takeaways from the indictment secured by special counsel Robert Mueller:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1) The operation started as far back as 2014.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors say the conspirators had been planning their efforts for years, started as early as 2014 to track and study social media pages focused on political and social issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spring of that year, the indictment says, an infamous Russian \u201ctroll farm\u201d known as the Internet Research Agency launched a strategy seeking to disrupt the 2016 presidential election, intending to \u201cspread distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IRA also started an operation called the \u201ctranslator project\u201d that used Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube to influence the U.S. population. Its research later informed the alleged Russian trolls\u2019 behavior during the campaign. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2) The plot had strong links to Putin.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indictment says the IRA\u2019s disinformation campaign got funding from two Russian organizations, Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord Catering \u2014 entities that have \u201cvarious Russian government contracts\u201d and are controlled by Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin. Prigozhin, a billionaire, is reported to be a close Putin ally and is sometimes known in Russian media as his \u201cchef,\u201d according to The Associated Press. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://fbk.info/investigations/post/256/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;According to&lt;/a&gt; the Anti-Corruption Foundation, a Russia-based nonprofit that investigates corruption among high-ranking Moscow officials, Prigozhin has became one of the largest state contractors in Russia because of Putin\u2019s love for his cooking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3)&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The trolls supported Trump and trashed Clinton.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IRA trolls\u2019 primary directive was to \u201ccommunicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton\u201d and \u201cto denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump,\u201d the indictment says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One instruction from the IRA&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;told the trolls to \u201cuse any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump \u2014 we support them),\u201d according to the indictment. One IRA-controlled Facebook page, called \u201cSecured Borders,\u201d even drew flak during an internal IRA review for having \u201ca low number of posts dedicated to criticizing Hillary Clinton.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frequently, the IRA trolls produced materials intended to promote pro-Trump and anti-Clinton hashtags on Twitter, including #TrumpTrain, #MAGA and #Hillary4Prison. Starting in the second half of 2016, the alleged trolls also encouraged minority groups either to not vote or to vote for a third-party candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the IRA told its trolls to create \u201cpolitical intensity through supporting radical groups, users dissatisfied with [the] social and economic situation and oppositional social movements.\u201d &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/01/social-media-ads-russia-wanted-americans-to-see-244423\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;IRA-controlled pages&lt;/a&gt; on social media platforms had names like \u201cBlacktivist,\u201d \u201cUnited Muslims of America,\u201d \u201cArmy of Jesus\u201d and \u201cSouth United,\u201d names that pointed up existing U.S. social on issues like the Black Lives Matter movement or anti-Muslim bias. These pages commanded hundreds of thousands of online followers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4) It wasn\u2019t just an online scheme.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least two of the defendants traveled for several weeks through the U.S. in June 2014, making stops in Nevada, California, New Mexico, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, Texas and New York, prosecutors said. Another co-conspirator working with the IRA traveled in November 2014 to Atlanta, later debriefing colleagues about the visit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;And on May 29, 2016, the indictment says, the IRA arranged for an American to stand in front of the White House with a sign that read, \u201cHappy 55th Birthday Dear Boss.\u201d The document speculates that the sign was meant as a birthday greeting for Prigozhin, who turned 55 two days later. The defendants explained to the American that the sign was for someone who \u201cis a leader here and our boss \u2026 our funder,\u201d&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the indictment says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later that year, the defendants started to organize political rallies across the U.S., including one where they paid someone to dress as Clinton wearing a prison uniform, the indictment says. The trolls \u201cpromoted these rallies while pretending to be U.S. grassroots activists who were located in the United States but unable to meet or participate in person.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such rally was held on July 9, 2016, in Washington, where a &amp;quot;U.S. person&amp;quot; was recruited to hold a sign depicting Clinton and a bogus quote attributed to her: \u201cI think Sharia Law will be a powerful new direction of freedom.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IRA also allegedly organized two political rallies in New York in June and July of that year. The June rally was dubbed \u201cMarch for Trump,\u201d while the July follow-up was \u201cDown with Hillary.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5) The trolls had 'unwitting' insider help.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest bombshells in the indictment is the detail that the IRA trolls allegedly communicated with the people tied to the Trump campaign. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cSome defendants, posing as U.S. persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump Campaign,\u201d the document says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the indictment adds that these people also communicated \u201cwith other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, IRA employees apparently tricked a Texas-based grass-roots organization into giving them tips on the American political landscape. According to court documents, the organization advised the cloaked Russians to focus their activities on \u201cpurple states like Colorado, Virginia &amp;amp; Florida.\u201d The defendants later picked up the term \u201cpurple states,\u201d using it frequently in their communications, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, Russians using fake online personas contacted \u201cover 100 real U.S. persons\u201d as part of their scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mueller\u2019s team also unsealed a guilty plea Friday of Richard Pinedo, a California man who is accused of selling the Russians the bank account numbers that were later used for identity fraud \u2014 without knowing they were Russians or what was being done with the information. \u201cAlthough Pinedo was not directly involved in the registration of these accounts using stolen identities, he willfully and intentionally avoided learning about the use of stolen identities,\u201d the document says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6) Hundreds of people might have been involved.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although prosecutors indicted only 13 individuals, court documents indicate that the scheme involved dozens and perhaps hundreds of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the indictment, the IRA\u2019s \u201ctranslator project\u201d focused exclusively on social media disinformation campaigns in the United States. More than 80 individuals were allegedly assigned to the team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More broadly, court documents say the IRA \u201cemployed hundreds of individuals for its online operations, ranging from creators of fictitious personas to technical and administrative support.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And throughout the document, there are references to \u201cco-conspirators\u201d without specifying how many there might have been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7) The Russians spent millions of dollars.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Court documents indicate that the IRA\u2019s annual budget reached \u201cthe equivalent of millions of U.S. dollars.\u201d The money paid for an organization that had all the departments of a Silicon Valley tech firm \u2014 graphics, data analysis, IT and finance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IRA even apparently had a department dedicated to \u201csearch-engine optimization,\u201d the practice of injecting  buzzwords into posts and headlines to make sure the content shows up higher in search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the IRA, Concord had a broader interference operation it called \u201cProject Lakhta,\u201d which was funded to the tune of more than $1.25 million each month. Project Lakhta was not entirely focused on the U.S., though. According to prosecutors, it also targeted Russian audiences and other foreign countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indictment also says that beginning in at least 2015, the IRA started spending thousands of dollars every month on advertisements on social media sites to promote its fabricated groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8) The IRA used U.S. technology to cover their tracks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alleged Russian trolls took extensive steps to hide their activities, often purchasing and operating American tools to help them remain anonymous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defendants \u201cprocured and used computer infrastructure, based partly in the United States, to hide the Russian origin of their activities and to avoid detection by U.S. regulators and law enforcement,\u201d the indictment says. They  purchased space on these American computer servers was used to set up so-called virtual private networks, a tool used to establish an encrypted, secure network, commonly used in countries like China that heavily monitor and restrict the internet. Essentially, a VPN allows people to privately transmit data across a public network. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, the IRA team \u201cdeleted and destroyed data, including emails, social media accounts, and other evidence of their activity,\u201d the indictment says, indicating that the defendants did so to impede U.S. investigators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9) The indictment doesn\u2019t mention the election hacks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indictment contains no references to the suspected Russian hacks that roiled the 2016 election, including the digital break-in of the Democratic National Committee and the infiltration of emails to and from Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intrusions later led to internal documents and emails being posted across the internet on activist sites like WikiLeaks, as well as blogs started by mysterious online personas. Some of them worsened an already ugly split between the party\u2019s Clinton and Sanders camps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. intelligence agencies have placed blame for these hacks and subsequent leaks squarely on the Kremlin, alleging that senior officials both orchestrated the digital assaults and coordinated the dissemination of the information.

The Russians allegedly paid one American in Florida to dress up as Hillary Clinton in a prison uniform and hired another to build a cage to &amp;quot;imprison&amp;quot; the Clinton impersonator at a Florida rally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effort was&amp;nbsp;led by the St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency, a notorious online misinformation operation with suspected Kremlin ties, according to the indictment, and involved what the court filing called &amp;quot;unwitting&amp;quot; U.S. citizens and Trump campaign officials&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indictment concludes that the Internet Research Agency &amp;quot;had a strategic goal to sow discord in the U.S. political system.&amp;quot; While noting that the operation undermined multiple presidential candidates, including Trump GOP rivals Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, the document says that the shadowy Russian agency's operations &amp;quot;included supporting the presidential campaign of then-candidate Donald J. Trump... and disparaging Hillary Clinton.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Trump campaign officials or associates are named in the indictment, which does not address the Russian hacking and theft of Democratic emails during the 2016 campaign or the other known contacts between Trump associates and Russians. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor does the indictment say whether the defendants were acting on orders from the Kremlin. But U.S. intelligence officials have previously stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally approved a wider election interference operation. Russia experts said the Kremlin was likely behind the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s hard to read the indictment and not see the 'troll factory' as conducting a Kremlin-sponsored covert action aimed at the U.S. political system,&amp;quot; said Andrew Weiss, a former Clinton White House National Security Council aide who handled Russia issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weiss and others noted that one of the indicted Russians, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, who controls two companies that finance the Internet Research Agency, is a close Putin ally. The State Department sanctioned Prigozhin last year, citing his ties to senior Russian government officials and Russia's defense ministry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats said the new charges underscored the gravity of Mueller's investigation and the need for his political independence amid calls from conservatives for an end to his work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump himself claimed vindication in a Friday afternoon &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/964594780088033282\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President. The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!&amp;quot; Trump wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mueller's indictment does not say one way or another whether the Russian efforts might have influenced voter behavior, however, although U.S. intelligence officials have previously said that Russian hacking efforts did not manipulate voting machines to alter the official election vote count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The document does allege that some of the defendants were in communication with Trump\u2019s campaign, but not that Trump officials knowingly colluded with Russia. Its specific charges include conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud and aggravated identity theft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cSome defendants, posing as U.S. persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump Campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities,\u201d the indictment said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Mueller's indictment, the defendants allegedly posed as Americans in online interactions with political and social activists. In once instance, the Russians &amp;quot;communicated with a real U.S. person affiliated with a Texas-based grassroots organization&amp;quot; who recommended they focus on so-called \u201cpurple&amp;quot; states such as Colorado, Virginia and Florida. The indictment alleges that the Russians then began using the term \u201cpurple states\u201d in subsequent planning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein emphasized at a Friday news conference that the indictment does not accuse any Americans of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThere is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity,\u201d Rosenstein told reporters. \u201cThere is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cVery happy,\u201d Trump personal attorney John Dowd wrote in an email to POLITICO when asked for his reaction on the Mueller indictments. He did not elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Democrats argued that the indictment underscores the gravity of Russia's election interference, and the importance of Mueller's work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe Special Counsel\u2019s indictments make absolutely clear that the Russians perpetrated a strategic effort to undermine and influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election to support the campaign of Donald Trump, and are continuing to interfere with our elections,&amp;quot; Democratic House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As desperately as President Trump insists that the Special Counsel investigation is a \u2018hoax\u2019, these latest indictments build on multiple guilty pleas and indictments of several Trump campaign officials, demonstrating the gravity of the Trump-Russia scandal,&amp;quot; Pelosi added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Trump's tweet, the White House released a statement quoting Trump as saying, &amp;quot;[w]e cannot allow those seeking to sow confusion, discord, and rancor to be successful. It\u2019s time we stop the outlandish partisan attacks, wild and false allegations, and far-fetched theories, which only serve to further the agendas of bad actors, like Russia, and do nothing to protect the principles of our institutions. We must unite as Americans to protect the integrity of our democracy and our elections.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement made no mention of any possible Trump administration response to the Russian interference. Trump has repeatedly said would like to forge warmer relations with Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, &lt;a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/419049-us-indictment-elections-russian-reaction/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; the indictment's allegations &amp;quot;absurd,&amp;quot; according to the Russian news outlet RT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mueller's 37-page charging document alleges that the Russian operatives created online accounts under names like &amp;quot;Woke Blacks,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Blacktivist&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;United Muslims of America&amp;quot; to encourage minority groups not to vote for Clinton. They also promoted Twitter hashtags like #Hillary4Prison, alleged on Facebook that Clinton's campaign had committed voter fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is illegal for foreign nationals to purchase advertising, including on social media platforms like Facebook, meant to influence a U.S. election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the indicted Russians allegedly traveled to the U.S. in 2014, visiting Nevada, California, New Mexico, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, Louisiana, Texas and New York \u201cto gather intelligence\u201d and that the duo had discussed \u201cevacuation scenarios.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indictment also alleges that the Russian effort continued after election day, in the form of at least two rallies organized against the newly-elected Trump \u2014 presumably with the goal of sowing further division within the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Republican Party spokeswoman &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/kayleighmcenany/status/964569075975446528\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; those findings, presumably to suggest that the Russians did not actually favor Trump. But the indictment overwhelmingly shows the Russians favored Trump and opposed Clinton. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indictment also alleges that the Russian-created &amp;quot;Blacktivist&amp;quot; Instagram account promoted the candidacy of Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein. Hillary Clinton herself has asserted that Stein may drawn a decisive number of votes from her in key swing states &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Choose peace and vote for Jill Stein,&amp;quot; the account said. &amp;quot;Trust me, it's not a wasted vote.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mueller's court filing also details Russian efforts to organize pro-Trump rallies in Florida and says the Russians contacted three unnamed Trump campaign officials seeking assistance. The Russians also organized rallies in New York City, and also in Pennsylvania under the Facebook rubric of &amp;quot;Miners for Trump.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Russian co-conspirators allegedly relied on traditional tools of spycraft to conceal their efforts. They purchased cameras, SIM cards and &amp;quot;drop phones&amp;quot; to communicate secretly and discussed &amp;quot;evacuation scenarios&amp;quot; for colleagues who entered the U.S. under false pretenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weiss, now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, called those telltale signs of &amp;quot;intelligence-style tradecraft&amp;quot; suggesting a sophisticated Kremlin-backed operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indictment also accuses the defendants of deleting emails, social media accounts and other evidence amid media reports about Russian election meddling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe had a slight crisis here at work: the FBI busted our activity (not a joke),&amp;quot; one defendant wrote in an email to a family member. \u201cSo, I got preoccupied with covering tracks together with the colleagues. I created all these pictures and posts, and the Americans believed that it was written by their people.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts called it highly unlikely that the named Russians would ever face justice within the U.S. That would require their extradition by a Russian government which calls the charges false, or for one of the defendants to visit the U.S. at risk of almost certain arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cHow are you actually going to do anything against these guys if they all stay hidden in Russia?\u201d asked Clint Watts, a former FBI national security official and expert on Russian disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Internet Research Agency has already played a starring role in Congressional inquiries into how Silicon Valley tech giants have handled Russian disinformation schemes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ads and posts said to be placed by the IRA were displayed in Congressional hearings last fall that featured testimony from Google, Facebook, and Twitter executives. Twitter revealed last month that it had identified some 3,100 accounts linked to the so-called &amp;quot;troll farm.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indictment offers the most comprehensive road map of the IRA's methods to date, including its organizational chart, which features divisions dedicated to graphics and mastering search-engine optimization, commonly known as \u201cSEO.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indictment concludes that the IRA used digitally savvy techniques, from assessing the reach of the social-media groups they might infiltrate to having supervisor\u2019s check workers\u2019 posts for authenticity. The agency also used so-called virtual private networks (VPNs) to make it appear as if they were users logging into the targeted internet sites from within the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watts said a big question going forward centers around what Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites do if the Internet Research Agency keeps trying to use their platforms. \u201cThey can create real personas and still continue to do influence if they wanted to,\u201d Watts said. \u201cThe Internet Research Agency hasn\u2019t gone away.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This indictment serves as a reminder that people are not always who they appear to be on the Internet,&amp;quot; Rosenstein told reporters Friday. &amp;quot;The indictment alleges that the Russian conspirators want to promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indictment is likely to rekindle interest in steps the U.S. can take to combat online Russian influence operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Mark Warner (D-Va.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) introduced a bill last year that would create federal disclosure requirements for political advertisements sold online, including who paid for them, much like those governing television and radio ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill now 16 co-sponsors, but McCain is the only Republican among them, and Klobuchar said recently it probably won\u2019t pass this year.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Klobuchar and the lead sponsor of a House companion bill, Rep. Derek Kilmer (D-Wash.), called for Congress to act right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mueller's office also revealed Friday that a California man pleaded guilty earlier this month to taking part in identity thefts the Russians carried out in order to fund rallies as well as Facebook ads promoting their election-related social media accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Pinedo, 28, of Santa Paula, Calif, entered a guilty plea in a closed federal courtroom in Washington Monday to a single felony charge of identity fraud. Pinedo admitted that his company, Auction Essistance, sold bank account numbers that other users used to set up accounts with \u201ca large digital payments company.\u201d The court filings in his case provide little detail, but the indictment against the Russians says they used PayPal accounts to purchase online ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A statement of facts Pinedo accepted that were unsealed Friday say that he knew many of his customers were abroad and that he \u201cwillfully and intentionally avoided learning\u201d about the stolen identities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pinedo\u2019s plea is the third known guilty plea in the Mueller probe, following the guilty pleas by former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos and by former national security adviser Michael Flynn to making false statements to investigators. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to court records, the case against the Russians is assigned to three prosecutors from Mueller\u2019s office: Jeannie Rhee, Lawrence Atkinson and Ryan Dickey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kyle Cheney, Josh Gerstein, Ashley Gold, Nancy Scola and Darren Samuelsohn contributed reporting.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 18:05:52 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>lnelson@politico.com (Louis Nelson)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/trump-russia-indictments-mueller-investigation-415667</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>McMaster: 'incontrovertible' evidence of Russian interference in election</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/www.politico.eu/article/h-r-mcmaster-incontrovertible-evidence-of-russian-interference-in-election/</link>\n      <description/>\n      <dc:creator>Fiona Maxwell</dc:creator>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/www.politico.eu/article/h-r-mcmaster-incontrovertible-evidence-of-russian-interference-in-election/</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>The Thriller That Predicted the Russia Scandal</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/17/political-thriller-russia-scandal-trump-david-pepper-217020</link>\n      <description>David Pepper\u2019s 2016 novel is eerily similar to recent real-world political events. But wait until you read the sequel.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;David Pepper recently had to block someone on Twitter for the first time in his life, because he was tired of being accused, repeatedly, of hiding his real identity as a Russian spy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf I were a Russian spy, would I really release my plot in novel form in advance?\u201d the 46-year-old Cincinnatian asks me, mock-bewildered, on a recent Friday morning. \u201cThen I wouldn\u2019t be a very good spy.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The online tormentor isn\u2019t just throwing out random espionage allegations for no reason. He\u2019s decided to go after Pepper because his first book\u2014&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Peoples-House-David-Pepper/dp/1619845121/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=&amp;amp;sr=\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;The People\u2019s House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, a quick, lively thriller full of labyrinthine scandal and homey Rust Belt touches\u2014reads like a user\u2019s guide to the last two years in U.S. politics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Pepper wrote the book before any of it actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The People\u2019s House&lt;/i&gt; centers around a Russian scheme to flip an election and put Republicans in power by depressing votes in the Midwest. Pipeline politics play an unexpectedly outsize role. Sexual harassment and systematic coverups in Congress abound. But it\u2019s no unimaginative rehash. Pepper released the book in the summer of 2016, just as the presidential contest between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton was heating up\u2014and before Russia\u2019s real-life campaign to influence the election had been revealed. In fact, the heart of the story had been written for three years when Russian government sent hackers to infiltrate the Democratic National Committee and sent their trolls to influence the election on social media. The Putin-like oligarch Pepper portrays as pulling the strings of U.S. politics had been fleshed out for two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a self-publishing service, Pepper didn\u2019t expect much of a reception, and he didn\u2019t get one at first, beyond his amused friends and colleagues. But when a &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/i&gt;reviewer that November surprised him by calling &lt;i&gt;The People\u2019s House&lt;/i&gt; \u201ca sleeper candidate for political thriller of the year,\u201d that started to change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Pepper\u2019s Twitter stalker\u2014and the stream of readers who downloaded the volume on Amazon after the &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; review\u2014didn\u2019t yet know was that he was about to do it all over again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he waited for edits on the first book, early in 2016, Pepper got started on a sequel, &lt;i&gt;The Wingman&lt;/i&gt;. He finished the bulk of the manuscript by January 2017, as Trump was getting sworn in. Now, one year into Trump\u2019s tenure, his second offering in the otherwise dull world of political thrillers\u2014which comes out on Monday\u2014is an equally complex tale of kompromat influencing a presidential election, even more sexual misconduct, and an Erik Prince-like military contractor with close ties to the administration, this time told through the lens of a rollicking Democratic presidential primary. He wrote it before the now-infamous Steele dossier became public knowledge (and before, Pepper says, he learned about it)&lt;b&gt;\u2014&lt;/b&gt;and months before revelations about the Blackwater founder\u2019s close ties to the Trump team and its Russian entanglements. If the first parallels were eerie, these ones were, Pepper admits, maybe even spooky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this time, it\u2019s not only the citizens of Twitter, but also Pepper\u2019s friends who are looking at him with a raised eyebrow an an unbelieving grin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pepper, after all, just happens to be the chairman of the Democratic Party in perhaps the most important battleground state in the country. And he also just happened to spend three years in Russia after college on a think tank project where his point of contact in the St. Petersburg\u2019s mayor\u2019s office was none other than a young Vladimir Putin himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm, for one, counts herself a fan of the books, and calls Pepper a \u201cpolitical Nostradamus.\u201d She gave away copies of his first book for Christmas last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as his friend, former Cincinnati Mayor Jerry Springer (yes, that one), tells me, laughing, \u201cIt kind of scared me. What does he know?\u201d&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The key to writing a successful political thriller&lt;/b&gt; is to come up with a scenario that\u2019s far-fetched enough to stretch the reader\u2019s imagination, but not so insane as to be wholly unbelievable. Two years ago, a successful Russian plot to throw an American election by manipulating the Midwest would almost certainly fall into the latter category. So might the idea of systematic blackmail of a presidential candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pepper allows that some of the Russian subplots are inspired by his time in St. Petersburg. At one point in &lt;i&gt;The People\u2019s House&lt;/i&gt;, Oleg Kazarov, the imposing Putin-like character behind most of the election-throwing intrigue reveals he can speak English only after sitting silently next to a translator through a long, contentious meeting. That, Pepper says, was based directly on his experience with the now-president of Russia, who was at the time a local municipal&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;administrator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But most of the volumes come straight from Pepper\u2019s expertise as a Democratic official back home in Ohio. After returning from Russia, and then graduating from Yale Law School, Pepper returned to Cincinnati, where before long he was elected to the city council. Following an unsuccessful mayoral run in 2005, he joined the Hamilton County Board of Commissioners, and, after four years, tried running for state auditor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around that time, Pepper noticed that one of his friends from his undergrad days at the &lt;i&gt;Yale Daily News &lt;/i&gt;had starting writing books, and when his statewide campaign fell short, he decided to give it a shot. He figured he could pull together something more realistic than the eye-roll-inducing political drivel he saw on TV. His manuscript, meant to be a nonpartisan three-alarm warning about the dangers of gerrymandering, was a side project that kept him occupied starting in 2011, which intensified as he got more and more feedback insisting that he actually make the book interesting, and not just a sermon about political dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added a Russian scheme in 2012, he says, and kept adding dimensions to the plot on free Saturdays, or instead of exercising, or dictating into his iPhone as he drove across the state\u2014even eventually during nap time when his first child was born. That task proved increasingly difficult as he again ran for statewide office in 2014 (again unsuccessfully, this time for attorney general), and then after he became the state party chairman in 2015, a job that forces him to commute at least an hour-and-a-half between Cincinnati and Columbus daily. Still, by late 2015, as the 2016 campaign was revving up, he had made enough progress that it was time to press print, which he did using a service that would help him self-publish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both books are surprisingly energetic tales that are only occasionally interrupted by drier blocks of text explaining nitty-gritty details of elections that are likely not obvious to casual readers. (In the first book, this means going deep on electoral administration procedures and congressional fundraising, in the second, it\u2019s campaign finance law.) Each is told from the perspective of Jack Sharpe, an aging political reporter and ex-football star who finds himself mired in significant international intrigue after his local Democratic&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;congressman unexpectedly loses his seat in a midterm election Sharpe is covering for his hometown &lt;i&gt;Youngstown&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Vindicator&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The People\u2019s House&lt;/i&gt; begins at that Election Night party-turned-wake. As one shock GOP win becomes an unexpected wave in swing seats across the country, Sharpe recognizes that he has a bigger story than expected on his hands. Before long, the ousted local congressman is found dead\u2014just hours, Sharpe discovers, after he had tried getting in touch with the reporter. The story unspools from there, packed with both the expected classics of a political thriller\u2014Bourbon swilling and cigar chomping lobbyists! Single-car accidents! Kidnappings! Mysterious deaths! Goon squads! A conniving congressman who wants to be president!\u2014and colorful characters whose descriptions highlight Pepper\u2019s depth of experience in the field, from a folksy county party chairman to&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;encouraging but cash-strapped&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;local newspaper editors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of a tampered-with midterm doesn\u2019t match up directly with what happened in 2016, of course, but the parallels are obvious. Sharpe discovers voting anomalies in districts where the voting machines were run by a new mysterious company, which leads to an ugly partisan divide between parties arguing over the legitimacy of the election. Sharpe eventually determines the voting machine company is owned by a Russian determined to throw the races\u2014Kazarov. Sound familiar? He digs deeper. The reason Kazarov wants the GOP in power is so that his controversial pipeline plan will be approved. A congressman who discovers the plot early on decides not to expose it, instead using it to his own advantage while carrying out inappropriate sexual relationships with aides on the side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the first book started as a rant against gerrymandering, the second was originally intended as an anti-dark money screed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just after sending in the &lt;i&gt;People\u2019s House&lt;/i&gt; manuscript for its edit in early 2016, Pepper was on the treadmill in his Cincinnati basement watching the Republican presidential contenders debate in Goffstown, New Hampshire. He grew increasingly animated as Chris Christie repeatedly went after Marco Rubio, a surprising tactic that seemed like it was obviously designed to benefit Trump. By the end of the night, &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Wingman&lt;/i&gt; had clicked for Pepper, the first scene already written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second novel opens with a Democratic primary debate in New Hampshire, moderated by Sharpe, who\u2019s still settling into his job at the TV network that snapped him up after his bombshell stories about the last election cycle. There, young upstart congressman Anthony Bravo, a veteran, surprisingly goes after a front-running senator, Wendell Stevens. The tense exchange kicks off Stevens\u2019 long fall from the front of the pack while vaulting Bravo ahead, and also helping a third candidate, Governor Peter Nicholas. Digging into the surging candidates soon after, Sharpe\u2019s team finds a trail of bodies, kidnappings and unaccountable dark money nonprofits. Following the cash trail, and using some unorthodox techniques that wouldn\u2019t pass real-world journalistic muster, they eventually find that a military contractor closely tied to the current Republican administration has been orchestrating the primary from afar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then\u2014and here come the spooky parallels\u2014Sharpe figures out the shadowy group\u2019s tactics for controlling the politicians: blackmail, a storyline written well before the Steele dossier raised the possibility that Russia has compromising information on Trump.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;And their sinister leader is obviously written as a Prince-like character. After Pepper wrote it, it was reported that Prince, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u2019 brother, had both secretly met with the head of a Russian investment fund in the Seychelles, and then proposed building a private spy program to administration higher-ups. At one point in the book, the Putin-inspired Russians try hacking into a defense contractors\u2019 internal systems (again, just like reality).&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of which is to say that when &lt;i&gt;The Wingman&lt;/i&gt; is published on Monday, Pepper is preparing for another round of bewilderment from his friends, colleagues and randos on the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pepper\u2019s day job\u2014trying to guide his party to victory in dozens of up- and down-ballot races every other November\u2014kept him from doing a proper publicity tour for &lt;i&gt;The People\u2019s House&lt;/i&gt;, and the book didn\u2019t get much press beyond the &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; article. (Despite the brief resulting Amazon bump,&lt;i&gt; The People\u2019s House&lt;/i&gt; was no best-seller.) The story for &lt;i&gt;The Wingman&lt;/i&gt; may be similar: Pepper\u2019s tasked with winning a Senate and gubernatorial race this fall, along with a whole slate of down-ballot contests, making a publicity push difficult. But he\u2019s well aware that the continued trickle of real-life news mirroring the books is likely to draw further eyeballs his way. Friday\u2019s indictments were yet another echo of the text he put to bed months earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pepper is still frequently inundated with links to news stories that seem reminiscent of his fiction. He\u2019s often directed to articles describing 2016 voting patterns in some Michigan districts that look remarkably like the anomalies he describes in the book. On occasion, someone will ask him if he meant to write such obvious parallels to reality, and he\u2019ll realize there\u2019s a whole new dimension he hadn\u2019t even considered. A library group in Ohio recently pointed out to him that the sexual abuse cover-up described in &lt;i&gt;The People\u2019s House&lt;/i&gt; looks a lot like some of the offices currently being exposed as the #MeToo movement intensifies. He says a few weeks ago readers were even asking him for his Super Bowl pick. (And yes, he chose the Eagles.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And though he doesn\u2019t shy from his fiction\u2019s unexpected relationship with reality, Pepper is still trying to ring the alarm about gerrymandering and dark money, and he\u2019s equally concerned that yet another piece of &lt;i&gt;The Wingman&lt;/i&gt; will come true: conservative organizations meddling in Democratic primaries. Plus, he says, we can\u2019t write off the CIA director\u2019s warning late last month of more Russian attempts to sway the upcoming midterms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf there\u2019s interference in \u201918, it will look like my book,\u201d he warns, pointing to the &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/15/russia-hacking-election-security-217008\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;relative ease&lt;/a&gt; of hacking voting machines versus releasing emails and hoping they\u2019ll make a difference a la 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, others are starting to echo that concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if David knew something was going to happen historically before he wrote the first book,\u201d says Ted Strickland, the former Ohio governor who himself lost a swing-state Senate race in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cGiven what\u2019s happening, I\u2019m not sure the thesis of that first book was all that far-fetched.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 11:57:57 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>gdebenedetti@politico.com (Gabriel Debenedetti)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/17/political-thriller-russia-scandal-trump-david-pepper-217020</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Congress: All the latest news</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/www.politico.com/congress</link>\n      <description/>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/www.politico.com/congress</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Trump visits hospital in Florida, praises first responders</title>\n      <description/>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"false\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Inside the Trump Administration\u2019s Internal War Over the VA</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/16/trump-veterans-affairs-va-david-shulkin-217013</link>\n      <description>The president likes him, but the VA secretary is at odds with his own staff over policy. And the fight is spilling out into the open.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This article is being co-published by &lt;a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/the-trump-administration-goes-to-war-over-the-va\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;ProPublica&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Shulkin, the secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, showed up to what he thought would be a routine Senate oversight &lt;a href=\"https://www.veterans.senate.gov/hearings/the-state-of-the-va-01172018\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;hearing&lt;/a&gt; in January, only to discover it was an ambush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senator Jerry Moran, Republican from Kansas, was the sole holdout among members of the veterans affairs committee on a bill that would shape the future of the agency. The bipartisan bill had the support of 26 service groups representing millions of veterans. But Moran was pushing a rival piece of legislation, and it had the support of a White House aide who wields significant clout on veterans policy. Neither proposal could advance as long as there was any doubt about which President Donald Trump wanted to sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moran blamed Shulkin for the impasse. \u201cIn every instance, you led me to believe that you and I were on the same page,\u201d Moran said at the hearing. \u201cOur inability to reach an agreement is in significant part related to your ability to speak out of both sides of your mouth: double talk.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were gasps in the hearing room. It was an astounding rebuke for a Trump appointee to receive from a Republican senator, especially for Shulkin, who was confirmed by the Senate unanimously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly ruffled, Shulkin hesitated before answering. \u201cI think it is grossly unfair to make the characterizations you have made of me, and I\u2019m disappointed that you would do that,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I am trying to do is give you my best advice about how this works.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moran dug in. \u201cI chose my words intentionally,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you tell me one thing and you tell others something else. And that\u2019s incompatible with our ability to reach an agreement and to work together.\u201d Moran then left the hearing for another appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exchange exposed tensions that had been brewing for months behind closed doors. A battle for the future of the VA has been raging between the White House and veterans groups, with Shulkin caught in the middle. The conflict erupted into national headlines this week as a result of a seemingly unrelated development: the release of a lacerating inspector general report on Shulkin that found \u201cserious derelictions\u201d in a taxpayer-funded European business trip in which he and his wife enjoyed free tickets to Wimbledon and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The underlying disagreement at the VA has a different flavor from the overhauls at a number of federal agencies. Unlike some Trump appointees, who took the reins of agencies with track records of opposing the very mission of the organization, Shulkin is a technocratic Barack Obama holdover. He not only participated in the past administration, but defends the VA\u2019s much-maligned health care system. He seeks to keep the organization at the center of veterans\u2019 health care. (An adviser to Shulkin said the White House isn\u2019t permitting him to do interviews.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But others in the administration want a much more drastic change: They seek to privatize vets\u2019 health care. From perches in Congress, the White House and the VA itself, they have battled Shulkin. In some instances, his own subordinates have openly defied him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple publications have explored the &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/va-chief-fights-for-his-political-future-amid-internal-strife-and-allegations-of-subterfuge/2018/02/15/e0c5ca2e-1278-11e8-9570-29c9830535e5_story.html?utm_term=.35fcf269e73c\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;turmoil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/us/veterans-affairs-david-shulkin.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;conflict&lt;/a&gt; at the VA in the wake of the IG report. Yet a closer examination shows the roots of the fight stretch back to the presidential campaign, and reveals how far the entropy of the Trump administration has spread. Much has been written on the \u201cchaos presidency.\u201d Every day seems to bring expos&amp;eacute;s of White House backstabbing and blood feuds. The fight over the VA shows not only that this problem afflicts federal agencies, too, but that friction and contradiction were inevitable: Trump appointed a VA secretary who wants to preserve the fundamental structure of government-provided health care; the president also installed a handful of senior aides who are committed to a dramatically different philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blistering report may yet cost Shulkin his job. But the attention on his travel-related misbehavior is distracting from a much more significant issue: The administration\u2019s infighting is imperiling a major legislative deal that could shape the future of the VA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Taking better care of veterans&lt;/b&gt; was a constant refrain at Trump\u2019s presidential campaign rallies. In the speech announcing his candidacy, he &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV-nyOM4_gc&amp;amp;t=780\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, \u201cWe need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets. Our vets have been abandoned.\u201d Ex-military people overwhelmingly supported him &lt;a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/2016/results/exit-polls\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;on Election Day&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/26/u-s-veterans-are-generally-supportive-of-trump/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;in office&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump\u2019s original policy proposals on veterans health, &lt;a href=\"https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/veterans-administration-reforms.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;unveiled&lt;/a&gt; in October 2015, largely consisted of tweaks to the current system. They called for increasing funding for mental health and helping vets find jobs; providing more women\u2019s health services; modernizing infrastructure and setting up satellite clinics in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ideas drew derisive responses from the Koch brothers-backed group Concerned Veterans for America (CVA). Pete Hegseth, its then-CEO, &lt;a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/defense/258790-veterans-group-pans-trumps-unserious-va-plan\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; the proposal \u201cpainfully thin\u201d and \u201cunserious.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump then took a sharp turn toward CVA\u2019s positions after clinching the Republican nomination. In a July 2016 speech in Virginia Beach, he embraced a very different vision for the VA, emphasizing private-sector alternatives. \u201cVeterans should be guaranteed the right to choose their doctor and clinics,\u201d Trump said, \u201cwhether at a VA facility or at a private medical center.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump\u2019s new 10-point plan for veterans policy resembled the CVA\u2019s priorities. In fact, six of the proposals drew directly on CVA ideas. Three of them aimed to make it easier to fire employees; a fourth advocated the creation of a reform commission; and two involved privatizing VA medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump\u2019s new direction, according to a campaign aide, was influenced by Jeff Miller, then the chairman of the House veterans committee. Miller, who retired from Congress in January 2017, was a close ally of CVA and a scathing critic of Obama\u2019s VA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller became one of the first congressmen to endorse Trump, in April 2016. He did so a few weeks after attending a meeting of the campaign\u2019s national security advisers. (That meeting, and the photo Trump&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/715725628465680386/photo/1\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; of it, would become famous because of the presence of George Papadopoulos, who is cooperating with investigators after pleading guilty to lying about Russian contacts. Miller is wearing the light gray jacket in the front right. Now a lobbyist with the law firm McDermott Will &amp;amp; Emery, he didn\u2019t reply to requests for comment.) Miller became Trump\u2019s point man on veterans policy, the campaign aide said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller and CVA &lt;a href=\"http://nation.time.com/2013/04/16/the-va-less-post-office-more-federal-express/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;portrayed&lt;/a&gt; the VA as the embodiment of \u201cbureaucratic ineptitude and appalling dysfunction.\u201d They were able to cite an ample supply of embarrassing scandals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scandals may come as less of a surprise than the fact that the VA actually enjoys widespread support among veterans. Most who use its healthcare report a positive experience. For example, &lt;a href=\"https://vfw-cdn.azureedge.net/-/media/VFWSite/Files/Advocacy/VFW-Our-Care-2017--Executive-Summary.pdf?la=en\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;92 percent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;of veterans in a poll&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;conducted by the Veterans of Foreign Wars reported that they would rather improve the VA system than dismantle it. &lt;a href=\"https://www.rand.org/news/press/2016/02/08/index1.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Independent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11606-016-3775-2\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; assessments&lt;/a&gt; have found that VA health care outperforms comparable private facilities. \u201cThe politicization of health care in the VA is frankly really unfair,\u201d said Nancy Schlichting, the retired CEO of the Henry Ford Health System, who chaired an independent commission to study the VA under the Obama administration. \u201cNoise gets out there based on very specific instances, but this is a very large system. If any health system in this country had the scrutiny the VA has, they\u2019d have stories too.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One piece of extreme noise was a scandal in 2014, which strengthened Miller and CVA\u2019s hand and created crucial momentum toward privatization. In an April 2014 hearing, Miller &lt;a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-113hhrg87677/pdf/CHRG-113hhrg87677.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; that officials at the VA hospital in Phoenix were effectively fudging records to cover up long delays in providing medical care to patients. He alleged that 40 veterans died while waiting to be seen. A week later, CVA&lt;a href=\"https://cv4a.org/project/timeline/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; organized a protest&lt;/a&gt; in Phoenix of 150 veterans demanding answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller\u2019s dramatic claims did not hold up. A comprehensive inspector general&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.va.gov/oig/pubs/VAOIG-14-02603-267.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; would eventually find 28 delays that were clinically significant; and though six of those patients died, the IG did not conclude that the delays caused those deaths. Later still, an&lt;a href=\"https://www.rand.org/news/press/2016/02/08/index1.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; independent assessment&lt;/a&gt; found that long waits were not widespread: More than 90 percent of existing patients got appointments within two weeks of their initial request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But such statistics were lost in the furor. \u201cNobody stood up and said, \u2018Wait a minute, time out, are we destroying this national resource because a small group of people made a mistake?\u2019\u201d a former senior congressional staffer said. \u201cEven those who considered themselves to be friends of the VA were silent. It was a surreal period. The way it grew tentacles has had consequences nobody would have predicted.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the heat of the scandal, Miller and CVA pushed for a new program called Choice. It would allow veterans who have to wait more than 30 days for a doctor\u2019s appointment or live more than 40 miles from a VA facility to get private-sector care. The VA has bought some private medical care for decades. But Choice represented a significant expansion, and Democrats were wary that it would open the door to privatizing VA health care on a much broader scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the Phoenix scandal had made it hard for the Democrats to resist. The Choice bill passed with bipartisan support, and President Obama signed it into law in August 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2016, then-candidate Trump was demanding further changes. \u201cThe VA scandals that have occurred on this administration\u2019s watch are widespread and inexcusable,\u201d he said in the Virginia Beach speech. \u201cVeterans should be guaranteed the right to choose their doctor and clinics, whether at a VA facility or at a private medical center. We must extend this right to all veterans.\u201d&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trump\u2019s contacts with CVA and its allies&lt;/b&gt; deepened during the transition. He met Hegseth, who left CVA to become a Fox News commentator, in Trump Tower. Trump picked Darin Selnick for the \u201clanding team\u201d that would supervise the transition at the VA. Selnick had directed CVA\u2019s policy task force, which in 2015 recommended splitting the VA\u2019s payer and provider functions and spinning off the latter into a government nonprofit corporation. Such an operation, organized along the lines of Amtrak, would be able to receive federal funding but also raise other revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump\u2019s consideration of Hegseth and Miller to lead the VA ran into &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/veterans-affairs-trump-232088\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;fierce resistance&lt;/a&gt; from veterans groups, powerful institutions whose clout is boosted by the emotional power that comes with members\u2019 having risked their lives for their country. At a meeting with the Trump transition in December 2016, officials from the major veterans groups held a firm line against privatizing the VA and any secretary intent on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump finally settled on Shulkin, 58, who ran the VA health system under Obama. Shulkin is a former chief of private hospital systems and a doctor\u2014an internist, he still occasionally treats patients at the VA\u2014who comes across more as a medical geek than the chief of a massive organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump heaps praise on Shulkin in public appearances and meets with him regularly in private. He was one of the first Cabinet secretaries Trump consulted about the impact of the government shutdown on January 21. They met at Camp David in December and lunched at the White House on February 8. \u201cYou\u2019re doing a great job,\u201d Trump told Shulkin at a January 9 signing ceremony for an executive order on veterans mental health services, handing Shulkin the executive pen. \u201cWe appreciate you.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump may like Shulkin. But that didn\u2019t stop his administration from appointing officials who opposed his philosophy. One of them, Jake Leinenkugel, a Marine Corps veteran and retired Wisconsin brewery owner, became the White House\u2019s &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trumps-shadow-cabinet-234088\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;eyes and ears&lt;/a&gt; inside the agency. He works in an office next to Shulkin\u2019s, but his title is senior White House adviser. Leinenkugel, 65, said he came out of retirement to take the position because he was \u201cexcited about taking POTUS\u2019 agenda and advancing it.\u201d As he put it, \u201cI\u2019m here to help veterans.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and Shulkin got along fine for a few months. But then, in May 2017, the two men clashed, as Shulkin accused Leinenkugel of undermining him. Shulkin wanted to nominate the VA\u2019s acting undersecretary for health, Poonam Alaigh, to take the position permanently, according to two people familiar with his thinking. But, the VA secretary charged, Leinenkugel told the White House to drop Alaigh. Shulkin confronted Leinenkugel, who denied any sabotage, according to an email Leinenkugel subsequently wrote. Alaigh stepped down in October and the position remains unfilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shulkin has even been at odds with his own press secretary, Curt Cashour, who came from Miller\u2019s House committee staff. Last month, Shulkin assigned an official to send a &lt;a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4379053-A-Jaslow-Signed-Letter.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to a veterans group that said the agency would update its motto, to be inclusive of servicewomen. (Adapted from Abraham Lincoln\u2019s second inaugural address, the original reads, \u201cTo care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow, and his orphan.\u201d The new version would read: \u201cTo care for those who shall have borne the battle and their families and survivors.\u201d)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cashour &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2018/02/06/is-the-va-motto-outdated-and-sexist-the-head-of-the-iraq-and-afghanistan-veterans-group-thinks-so/?utm_term=.54a73aefb76e\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; the motto wouldn\u2019t change. A few days later, the secretary\u2019s strategic plan went out using the updated, gender-neutral motto. Cashour then denied the change a second time, telling the &lt;i&gt;Post&lt;/i&gt; that was \u201cnot VA\u2019s position.\u201d A new document with the Lincoln quote restored subsequently appeared on the VA\u2019s website. Shulkin was stunned at being disobeyed by his own spokesman, two people briefed on the incident said. (Cashour denied defying the VA secretary. \u201cThe premise of your inquiry is false,\u201d he told ProPublica. Cashour said Shulkin never approved the letter regarding the updated motto and authorized the restoration of the original one.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there was Selnick, who became the administration\u2019s most effective proponent for privatization. He joined the VA as a \u201csenior adviser to the secretary.\u201d Though he reported to Shulkin, he quickly began developing his own policy proposals and conducted his own dealings with lawmakers, according to people with knowledge of the situation. In mid-2017 Shulkin pushed him out\u2014sort of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selnick left the VA offices and took up roost in the White House\u2019s Domestic Policy Council. There he started hosting VA-related policy meetings without informing Shulkin, according to people briefed on the meetings. At one such meeting of the \u201cVeterans Policy Coordinating Committee,\u201d Selnick floated merging the Choice program with military\u2019s Tricare insurance plan, according to documents from the meeting obtained by ProPublica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veterans groups were furious. At a November 17 meeting, Selnick boasted that Trump wouldn\u2019t sign anything without Selnick\u2019s endorsement, according to a person present. Shulkin would later tell a confidant that moving Selnick out of the VA was his \u201cbiggest mistake\u201d because he did even more damage from the White House. (Selnick did not reply to a request for comment. A White House spokesman said some VA officials were aware of the policy meetings that Selnick hosted. The spokesman said Selnick does not brief the president or the chief of staff.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selnick, 57, is a retired Air Force captain from California who worked in the VA under the George W. Bush administration. At CVA, he not only ran the policy task force, he testified before Congress and appeared on TV. In 2015, House Speaker John Boehner appointed Selnick to the Commission on Care, an independent body created by a congressional act to study the VA and make recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selnick impressed his fellow commissioners with his preparation but sometimes irked them with what they viewed as his assumption that he was in charge, people who worked with him on the commission said. Selnick often brought up his experience at the VA. But some commissioners scoffed behind his back because his position, in charge of faith-based initiatives, had little relevance to health care. Whatever his credentials, Selnick had audacious ambitions: He wanted to reconceive the VA\u2019s fundamental approach to medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selnick wanted to open up the VA so any veteran could see any doctor, an approach that would transform its role into something resembling an insurance company, albeit one with no restrictions on providers. Other commissioners worried that would cost the government more, impose fees and deductibles on veterans, and serve them worse. \u201cHe was probably the most vocal of all of the members,\u201d said David Gorman, the retired executive director of Disabled American Veterans who also served on the commission, \u201cin a good and a bad way.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bad part, in the view of Nancy Schlichting, the chairwoman, emerged when Selnick tried to \u201chijack\u201d the commission. Selnick and a minority of commissioners secretly drafted their own proposal, which went further than CVA\u2019s. (The group included executives of large health systems that stood to gain more patients.) They wrote that the \u201cthe current VA health care system is seriously broken\u201d with \u201cno efficient path to repair it.\u201d They proposed closing facilities, letting all veterans choose private care, and transitioning the rest to private care over two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The draft was written in a way that seemed to speak for the commission as a whole, with phrases like \u201cthe Commission recommends.\u201d The commission staff suggested labeling it a \u201c&lt;a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/912/2016/03/2016.3.18-Proposed-Strawman-Assessment-and-Recommendations.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;straw man report&lt;/a&gt;,\u201d implying it was meant to provoke discussion. Still, veterans organizations were &lt;a href=\"https://www.dav.org/learn-more/news/2016/joint-vso-letter-to-the-commission-on-care/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;angry&lt;/a&gt;, and Schlichting had to publicly&lt;a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/912/2016/04/Chairperson-Statement-4-01-2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; disavow&lt;/a&gt; the draft. \u201cDarin Selnick has never run a health system in his life and doesn\u2019t understand the complexity of it,\u201d Schlichting told ProPublica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For his part, Shulkin publicly staked out his vision in a March 17, 2016 &lt;a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1600307\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/i&gt;. In it, he defended the VA\u2019s quality of care and proposed reimagining the VA as an integrated system composed of its own core facilities, a network of vetted private-sector providers, and a third layer of private care for veterans in remote places. Shulkin also edited a book published last year trumpeting the VA\u2019s successes, called &lt;i&gt;Best Care Everywhere&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Almost four years after the Phoenix scandal&lt;/b&gt;, the emergency measure letting some veterans get care outside the VA is still limping along with temporary extensions, not to mention &lt;a href=\"https://www.va.gov/oig/pubs/VAOIG-15-03036-47.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;payment glitches&lt;/a&gt; and confusion about its rules. Key legislators grew tired of renewing emergency funding and wanted to find a long-term solution. In the House, negotiations broke down after Democrats boycotted a listening session featuring CVA. So last fall, focus turned to the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crux of the debate was the extent to which the VA should rely on private care. The chairman and ranking member on the Senate veterans committee, respectively, Johnny Isakson of Georgia and Jon Tester of Montana, drafted a bill to consolidate all of the VA\u2019s programs that pay for private care and let doctors and patients decide where veterans would get care. The VA would buy private care when that makes the most sense but would still coordinate all veterans care in an integrated, comprehensive way. The bill garnered the support of 26 veterans organizations and every committee member except Moran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moran represents the Koch brothers\u2019 home state; employees of Koch Industries are the second-largest source of campaign contributions in his career, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. &lt;a href=\"https://cv4a.org/cva-praises-mccain-moran-va-reform-bill/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;With the support of CVA&lt;/a&gt;, Moran wanted to establish clear criteria making veterans eligible for private-sector care, like the 30 days/40 miles standard in the Choice program. It might sound like a subtle distinction, but it means the difference between keeping all veterans within the VA system versus ceding the direction of patient care to the private sector. When the committee rejected his amendment, Moran proposed his own bill and signed up Arizona Senator John McCain as a co-sponsor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moran\u2019s bill initially called for all veterans to be able to choose private care. When a McCain aide shared it with a lobbyist for the American Legion, the lobbyist was so enraged by what he viewed as a bid to undermine the VA that he torched a copy of the bill and sent the McCain aide a &lt;a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4379056-Burned-McCain-Moran-draft.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;photo&lt;/a&gt; of the charred draft. (An American Legion spokesman declined to comment.) With the American Legion\u2019s input, McCain\u2019s and Moran\u2019s staffs toned down the bill to the point that they got letters of support from the group, along with Amvets and CVA. But American Legion and Amvets were still working to get consensus on the Isakson-Tester bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the Moran-McCain bill had a few key allies: Selnick and Leinenkugel. They had gained sway in part because of a White House vacuum. The president himself has been largely absent on veterans policy and there\u2019s no senior point person. The portfolio has at times belonged to Kellyanne Conway, Jared Kushner and Omarosa Manigault, according to veterans groups and congressional officials. (A White House spokesman said those officials played a role in \u201cveterans issues,\u201d but not \u201cveterans policy.\u201d The latter, the spokesman said, is overseen by Selnick on the Domestic Policy Council.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has given Selnick and Leinenkugel wide latitude to shape White House positions on issues that don\u2019t rise to Trump\u2019s level. \u201cDarin [Selnick] is pretty much in the ascendancy,\u201d said Michael Blecker, the executive director of Swords to Plowshares, a San Francisco-based charity serving veterans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as Moran had a competing claim to the Trump administration\u2019s support, the Isakson-Tester bill was stuck. Republicans wouldn\u2019t risk a floor vote on a bill the president might not sign. Shulkin supported the Isakson-Tester bill but he knew his rivals inside the White House were pushing for Moran\u2019s proposal. So Shulkin hedged, awkwardly praising both bills. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know which bill he wants,\u201d Joe Chenelly, executive director of Amvets, said. \u201cIf the White House wants something different, then we need to know how to reconcile that.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid the impasse, the Choice program was out of money again and needed an extension as part of the end-of-year spending deal. Tester vowed to make it the last one he would agree to. He called on Shulkin to break the stalemate by publicly endorsing his and Isakson\u2019s bill. \u201cI would love to have the VA come out forcefully for this bill,\u201d he&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/senatortester/videos/10155978621986665/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; said on the Senate floor&lt;/a&gt; in late December. \u201cI think it would help get it passed.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a private meeting, Isakson and Tester chided Shulkin for withholding support for their bill, according to three people briefed on the meeting. Shulkin told them he was doing the best he could, but he had to fend off a competing agenda from the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unbeknown to Shulkin, there was already talk in the White House of easing him out. On December 4, Leinenkugel wrote a memo, which ProPublica obtained, summarizing his disillusionment with Shulkin as well as with Shulkin\u2019s deputy, Thomas Bowman, and chief of staff, Vivieca Wright Simpson. (\u201cI was asked to tell the truth and I gave it,\u201d said Leinenkugel of his memo; he declined to say who requested it.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leinenkugel accused Bowman of disloyalty and opposing the \u201cdynamic new Choice options requested by POTUS agenda.\u201d The memo recommended that Bowman be fired\u2014and replaced by Leinenkugel himself. It also asserted that Wright Simpson \u201cwas proud to tell me she is a Democrat who completely trusts the secretary and it\u2019s her job to protect him.\u201d Leinenkugel accused her of delaying the placement of Trump\u2019s political appointees. Leinenkugel recommended replacing her, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Shulkin, Leinenkugel\u2019s memo advocated he be \u201cput on notice to leave after major legislation and key POTUS VA initiatives [are] in place.\u201d&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;After the clash between Moran and Shulkin&lt;/b&gt; at the January hearing, Isakson said the White House would provide feedback on his bill to help the committee chart a way forward. \u201cThe president basically is pushing to get a unanimous vote out of committee,\u201d said Rick Weidman, the top lobbyist for Vietnam Veterans of America. \u201cThe only reason why we didn\u2019t get it before was there is one mid-level guy on the Domestic Policy Council who threw a monkey wrench into it by confusing people about what the administration\u2019s position is.\u201d That person, Weidman said, is Selnick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House\u2019s feedback on the Isakson-Tester bill, a copy of which was obtained by ProPublica, was the closest the administration has come to a unified position on veterans health care. It incorporated input from the VA and the Office of Management and Budget. Selnick told veterans groups he wrote the memo, leaving some miffed that Selnick seemingly had the final word instead of Shulkin. (A White House spokesman said Selnick was not the only author.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selnick requested changes that might look like minor tweaks but would have dramatic policy consequences. \u201cIt\u2019s these very small differences in details that the public would never notice that change the character of the thing entirely,\u201d said Phillip Longman, whose 2007 book, &lt;i&gt;Best Care Anywhere&lt;/i&gt;, argued that the VA works better than private health care. (The title of the book Shulkin edited, &lt;i&gt;Best Care Everywhere&lt;/i&gt;, was a nod at Longman\u2019s book.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most important, the White House wanted clear criteria that make veterans eligible for private care. That was the main feature of Moran\u2019s bill and the sticking point in the negotiations. The administration also asked to preserve a piece of the Choice program by grandfathering in veterans living more than 40 miles away from a VA facility. CVA praised the White House for nudging the bill &lt;a href=\"https://cv4a.org/encouraging-ideas-veterans-choice-coming-washington/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;in Moran\u2019s direction&lt;/a&gt;. \u201cWe applaud President Trump for taking a firm stand in favor of more health care choice for veterans at the VA,\u201d the group\u2019s director, Daniel Caldwell, said in a&lt;a href=\"https://cv4a.org/press-release/cva-applauds-white-house-support-health-care-choices-veterans/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; statement&lt;/a&gt; dated January 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House feedback also called for removing provisions that would regulate providers, such as requiring them to meet quality standards and limiting opioid prescriptions. And the administration objected to provisions in the bill that would require it to fill critical vacancies at the VA and report back to Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selnick got what he asked for, but it still might not be enough. Isakson and Tester agreed to most of the changes. But in a White House meeting with veterans groups on February 5, Selnick continued to insist on open choice, suggesting that\u2019s what Trump wants. Selnick visited Moran\u2019s staff, a person with knowledge of the meeting said, and Moran indicated he wouldn\u2019t support the modified version of the Isakson-Tester bill. (A White House spokesman said Isakson and Tester did not accept all the changes, and negotiations continue. He denied that Selnick pushed for open choice. Moran\u2019s spokesman didn\u2019t answer emailed questions by press time.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tensions spilled out publicly again on February 8, when the &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/white-house-targets-vas-deputy-secretary-as-a-warning-shot-to-agencys-leader/2018/02/08/cc052006-0d11-11e8-95a5-c396801049ef_story.html?utm_term=.7e03984d7644\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the White House wanted to oust Bowman, Shulkin\u2019s deputy. The article said the purpose was to chastise Shulkin for \u201cfreewheeling\u201d\u2014working with senators who don\u2019t share the administration\u2019s position. Isakson\u2019s spokeswoman called it a \u201cshameful attempt\u201d to derail the negotiations. Isakson resolved to move ahead without Moran, the spokeswoman said, but it\u2019s not clear when the bill will get time on the Senate floor (the Senate focused on immigration this week and then will take a recess). Moran could still place a \u201chold\u201d on the bill or round up other senators to oppose it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shulkin determined that Selnick and Leinenkugel had to go, according to four people familiar with the secretary\u2019s thinking. But Shulkin doesn\u2019t appear to have the authority to fire them since they work for the White House. Plus, the attacks from the right were already taking a toll on Shulkin\u2019s standing. \u201cIf leaders at Trump\u2019s VA don\u2019t support REAL CHOICE\u2014why won\u2019t they resign?\u201d former CVA chief Hegseth &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/petehegseth/status/963471172112474113?ref_src=twcamp%5Eshare%7Ctwsrc%5Eios%7Ctwgr%5Ecom.apple.UIKit.activity.AirDrop%7Ctwcon%5E7100%7Ctwterm%5E0\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; on February 13, tagging Shulkin in the post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veterans advocates responded by defending Shulkin against attacks they viewed as originating with Selnick and Leinenkugel. \u201cThey thought they could coopt David,\u201d said Weidman, the lobbyist for Vietnam Veterans of America. \u201cWhen he couldn\u2019t be coopted, they decided to go after his character.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest blow came on February 14, when the VA\u2019s inspector general released its &lt;a href=\"https://www.va.gov/oig/pubs/VAOIG-17-05909-106.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on Shulkin\u2019s trip to Europe in April 2017. It concluded that Shulkin improperly accepted Wimbledon tickets, misused a subordinate as a \u201cpersonal travel concierge,\u201d lied to reporters, and that his chief of staff doctored an email in such a way that would justify paying travel expenses for Shulkin\u2019s wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shulkin disputed the IG\u2019s findings, but he again ran into trouble getting his message out from his own press office. A &lt;a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20180214171046/https:/www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=4009\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; insisting he had \u201cdone nothing wrong\u201d disappeared from the VA\u2019s website, and Cashour replaced it with one &lt;a href=\"https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=4010\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; \u201cwe look forward to reviewing the report and its recommendations in more detail before determining an appropriate response.\u201d Cashour said the White House directed him to take down Shulkin\u2019s statement and approved the new one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shulkin &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/14/david-shulkin-europe-travel-347064?lo=ap_c1\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;told &lt;span class=\"cms-magazineStyles-smallCaps\"&gt;Politico&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the IG report was spurred by internal opponents. \u201cThey are really killing me,\u201d he said. By Friday, February 16, his chief of staff had told colleagues she would retire, &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/16/va-secretary-david-shulkins-chief-staff-retiring-amid-travel-report-findings/344810002/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condemnation after the IG report was swift and widespread. House veterans committee member Mike Coffman, Republican from Colorado, called on Shulkin to resign. Democrats, though generally sympathetic to Shulkin, couldn\u2019t resist lumping the imbroglio in with other travel-expense tempests across Trump\u2019s cabinet (involving &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/10/04/how-we-found-tom-prices-private-jets-215680\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Tom Price&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal-watchdog-opens-probe-into-travel-by-interior-secretary-ryan-zinke/2017/10/02/3f24fbf8-a7ad-11e7-92d1-58c702d2d975_story.html?utm_term=.13318aea84ea\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Ryan Zinke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/14/scott-pruitt-first-class-travel-347631\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Scott Pruitt&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/politics/mnuchin-military-flights.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Steven Mnuchin&lt;/a&gt;). The chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate veterans committees said they were \u201cdisappointed\u201d and want Shulkin to address the allegations, but acknowledged the politics at work and the stakes in a joint statement: \u201cWe need to continue progress we have made and not allow distractions to get in the way.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, Shulkin appeared before another routine oversight hearing, in this instance on the House side. He told the representatives he would reimburse the government for his wife\u2019s travel and accept the IG\u2019s recommendations. Shulkin thanked the chairman and ranking member for urging their colleagues not to let the scandal commandeer the hearing. \u201cI do regret the decisions that have been made that have taken the focus off that important work,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning to the VA\u2019s budget, Shulkin resumed his tightrope walk. He praised the VA\u2019s services while acknowledging the need for some veterans to be treated outside the government\u2019s system. By the time he left the hearing, two hours later, the Trump administration\u2019s position on veterans health privatization remained a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 20:34:18 GMT</pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>Isaac Arnsdorf</dc:creator>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/16/trump-veterans-affairs-va-david-shulkin-217013</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Mitt Romney announces he's running for U.S. Senate in Utah</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/mitt-romney-senate-utah-415660</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney announced Friday that he's running for Senate in Utah, saying that &amp;quot;I am ready to fight for this great state and advocate for solutions that improve the lives of Utahns.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romney was widely expected to enter the race after Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch said in January that he wouldn\u2019t run for reelection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI am running for United States Senate because in these trying times there is no better moment to bring Utah\u2019s values to Washington. Utah\u2019s economic and political success is a model for our nation,\u201d Romney said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A statement emailed to reporters Friday morning by Romney\u2019s campaign said the former Massachusetts governor plans to visit all of Utah\u2019s 29 counties over the coming months and highlighted his experience heading the organizing committee for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Among his Massachusetts gubernatorial achievements, the statement listed Romney\u2019s role in developing \u201ca health insurance program that covered all citizens,\u201d a program that served as a blueprint for Obamacare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romney\u2019s campaign announcement also highlighted his role as a bishop and stake president in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which is headquartered in Salt Lake City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cUtahns are known for hard work, innovation, and our can-do pioneering spirit,\u201d Romney said in the statement. \u201cUtah\u2019s economic and political success is a model for our nation.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romney\u2019s Senate bid has drawn outsized national attention not only because of his status as a former GOP presidential nominee but also because he has been among the most vocal Republican critics of President Donald Trump. During the 2016 campaign, Romney urged Republican primary voters to cast ballots for anyone other than Trump and labeled him \u201ca phony\u201d and \u201ca fraud.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that same speech, Romney said Trump\u2019s \u201cpromises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University\u201d and that he was \u201cplaying the American public for suckers.\u201d Trump characteristically punched back at Romney throughout the campaign, labeling him a \u201cstiff\u201d who begged for an endorsement in 2012 and \u201cchoked like a dog\u201d in the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the two men seemed to warm in the weeks and months after Trump\u2019s 2016 election victory, when the president considered Romney among the finalists to be his secretary of state. Still, Romney has remained willing to criticize Trump, including last month over the president\u2019s reported characterization of certain African and Caribbean nations as \u201cshithole countries.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romney, in his campaign launch video, seemed to take a subtle jab at Trump\u2019s hardline immigration policies and a White House budget that experts have said will balloon the federal deficit. \u201cUtah has a lot to teach the politicians in Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cUtah has balanced its budgets. Washington is buried in debt\u2026 Utah welcomes legal immigrants from around the world. Washington sends immigrants a message of exclusion.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should Romney win the Senate seat in deep-red Utah, which has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1970, he would replace Hatch, the dean of the Senate and a staunch defender of the president. Eager to avoid replacing an ally with an antagonist, Trump launched a charm offensive against Hatch late last year in an ultimately futile effort to convince the 83-year-old senator to seek reelection this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 13:38:15 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>lnelson@politico.com (Louis Nelson)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/mitt-romney-senate-utah-415660</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>FBI failed to follow up on Florida shooting suspect tip in January</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/fbi-florida-shooting-errors-415664</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Federal Bureau of Investigation acknowledged on Friday that some \u201cprotocols were not followed\u201d after it obtained a tip in January that Nikolas Cruz, the suspect in the Florida school attack, had the potential of \u201cconducting a school shooting.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe are still investigating the facts,\u201d FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement. \u201cI am committed to getting to the bottom of what happened in this particular matter, as well as reviewing our processes for responding to information that we receive from the public.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI said a caller had provided the bureau with \u201cinformation about Cruz\u2019s gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts\u201d on Jan. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But because of a lapse in procedure, the bureau said, the information was \u201cnot provided\u201d to its regional field office in Miami and \u201cno further investigation was conducted at that time.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement prompted a wave of backlash by public officials, with Gov.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said in a statement on Friday that the FBI\u2019s failure to follow-up on the tip was \u201cinexcusable,\u201d calling on lawmakers to \u201cimmediately\u201d look into the bureau\u2019s procedures for screening information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe fact that the FBI is investigating this failure is not enough,\u201d Rubio. \u201cBoth the House and Senate need to immediately initiate their own investigations into the FBI\u2019s protocols for ensuring tips from the public about potential killers are followed through.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Broward County sheriff, Scott Israel, who is overseeing the regional investigation into the shooting, acknowledged on Friday that his office had received numerous calls requesting service for Cruz in recent years, though he did not detail the nature of the calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe have uncovered at the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office that we have had approximately 20 calls for service over the last few years regarding the killer,\u201d Israel said during a news conference. He added that some did not entail a police response while others involved out-of-state residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel vowed that all of the calls would be \u201clooked at and scrutinized\u201d to determine whether his office failed to respond properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the sheriff appeared to push back against claims that authorities had been negligent in their response, maintaining that the fault lay squarely with the suspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cAt the end of day, make no mistake about it, America: The only one to blame for this killing is the killer himself,\u201d Israel said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the fatal shooting on Wednesday, local and federal authorities have painted Cruz as a troubled individual. During a bond hearing in Florida on Thursday where Cruz was charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder, his attorneys described him as a \u201cbroken child.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump on Thursday lamented on Twitter that \u201cmany signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed\u201d had not been followed up on, pointing to \u201cneighbors and classmates\u201d who he said \u201cknew he was a big problem.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 17:43:37 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>clima@politico.com (Cristiano Lima)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/fbi-florida-shooting-errors-415664</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>FBI director faces call to resign after missing Florida school shooter warning</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/rick-scott-calls-for-fbi-director-resign-florida-shooting-415854</link>\n      <description>Florida Republican Gov. Rick Scott lashed out at Wray for failing to respond to alarms about the shooter.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;FORT LAUDERDALE \u2014 Gov. Rick Scott, enraged over the FBI\u2019s admission on Friday that it failed to act on a tip in January that the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting suspect had the potential of \u201cconducting a school shooting,\u201d demanded the resignation of FBI Director Christopher Wray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe FBI\u2019s failure to take action against this killer is unacceptable,\u201d Scott said in a statement. \u201cThe FBI has admitted that they were contacted last month by a person who called to inform them of Cruz\u2019s \u2018desire to kill people,\u2019 and \u2018the potential of him conducting a school shooting.\u2019 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cSeventeen innocent people are dead and acknowledging a mistake isn\u2019t going to cut it.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI acknowledged earlier Friday that some \u201cprotocols were not followed\u201d after the agency obtained a tip in January that shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz had the potential of \u201cconducting a school shooting.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe are still investigating the facts,\u201d Wray said in a statement. \u201cI am committed to getting to the bottom of what happened in this particular matter, as well as reviewing our processes for responding to information that we receive from the public.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI said a caller had provided them \u201cinformation about Cruz\u2019s gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts\u201d on Jan. 5. But due to a lapse in procedure, the bureau said, the information was &amp;quot;not provided&amp;quot; to the regional field office in Miami and &amp;quot;no further investigation was conducted at that time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cruz is accused of killing 17 people, including teachers and students, and injuring several others. Authorities said he opened fire on students and staffers at the suburban Fort Lauderdale high school on Wednesday afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cruz, a 19-year-old former student at the school, used an AR-15-style assault rifle to unleash a deadly onslaught at the school, according to the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office, which is the lead agency investigating the mass shooting. The FBI and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement are also assisting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another tipster reportedly flagged the FBI in September to a disturbing comment left by a user &amp;quot;nikolas cruz\u201d on YouTube. \u201cIm going to be a professional school shooter,\u201d the comment read. Two FBI agents investigated the matter, The Washington Post reports, but were unable to identify the person behind the post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his statement, Scott, a Republican, said an \u201capology will never bring these 17 Floridians back to life or comfort the families who are in pain.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe families will spend a lifetime wondering how this could happen, and an apology will never give them the answers they desperately need,\u201d he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe constantly promote \u2018see something, say something,\u2019 and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act,\u201d Scott said. &amp;quot;\u2018See something, say something\u2019 is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow-through from law enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe FBI director needs to resign,&amp;quot; said Scott.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bureau did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Scott's statement. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, however, lamented the &amp;quot;tragic consequences of those failures&amp;quot; on Friday, saying that intelligence officials &amp;quot;must do better&amp;quot; to prevent further shootings from taking place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is now clear that the warning signs were there and tips to the FBI were missed,&amp;quot; Sessions said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sessions announced that he had instructed Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to carry out an &amp;quot;immediate review&amp;quot; of protocols at the Justice Department and FBI to &amp;quot;ensure that we reach the highest level of prompt and effective response to indications of potential violence that come to us.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The FBI in conjunction with our state and local partners must act flawlessly to prevent all attacks,&amp;quot; Sessions added. &amp;quot;This is imperative, and we must do better.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cristiano Lima contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 21:18:28 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>sbustos@politico.com (Sergio Bustos)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/rick-scott-calls-for-fbi-director-resign-florida-shooting-415854</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>How white nationalists fooled the media about Florida shooter</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/florida-shooting-white-nationalists-415672</link>\n      <description>ABC, AP and others ran with false information on shooter\u2019s ties to extremist groups.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Following misrepresentations by a white nationalist leader and coordinated efforts by internet trolls, numerous researchers and media outlets spread a seemingly false claim that the man charged with killing more than a dozen people at a Florida high school belonged to an extremist group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement agencies say they have no evidence so far to support this claim, and the rumor appears to have been perpetrated by white nationalist trolls themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday afternoon, the Anti-Defamation League &lt;a href=\"https://www.adl.org/blog/florida-white-supremacist-group-admits-ties-to-alleged-parkland-school-shooter-nikolas-cruz\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that a white supremacist group claimed ties with Nikolas Cruz, who confessed to the shooting spree that killed at least 17 people, including many high-school students, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cA spokesperson for the white supremacist group Republic of Florida (ROF) told the Anti-Defamation League on Thursday, February 15, that Nikolas Cruz [....] was associated with his group,\u201d the ADL reported. The ADL quoted a man named Jordan Jereb, who runs the small group, which is based in Tallahassee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cJereb added that ROF had not ordered or wanted Cruz to do anything like the school shooting,\u201d the ADL wrote in a blog post that was quickly picked up by ABC News and The Associated Press, and later percolated through dozens of other media outlets. Even The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, picked up the claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some outlets reported they had their own conversations with Jereb or classmates of Cruz who allegedly corroborated the association of Cruz with ROF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a few hours later, after law enforcement agencies said they had no evidence linking Cruz to ROF, Jereb said his identification of Cruz was a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d and that he, too, had been the subject of a \u201cprank.\u201d On online forums and Twitter, trolls and white nationalists gloated at the disinformation they had sowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cAll of our evidence seems to point to the ADL getting this wrong,\u201d said Joan Donovan, a researcher who tracks online misinformation campaigns for Data &amp;amp; Society, a think tank in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ADL subsequently revised its report, as did many news outlets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;ADL shared information from our experts on extremism and claims from white supremacist that we believed could be helpful to both law enforcement and the public due to the fluid and evolving nature of the events,&amp;quot; an ADL spokesperson said in a statement on Friday. &amp;quot;Confirmation of whether Cruz was part of ROF is now in the hands of law enforcement, and that\u2019s what the Broward sheriff\u2019s team is looking into.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At a news conference on Thursday, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel told reporters that such a connection was \u201cnot confirmed at this time,\u201d but that law enforcement was continuing to investigate. The sheriff's office in Leon County, which contains Tallahassee, later told the Tallahassee Democrat that it had found &amp;quot;no known ties between the ROF, Jordan Jereb or the Broward shooter.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donovan called this an instance of \u201csource hacking,\u201d a tactic by which fringe groups coordinate to feed false information to authoritative sources such as ADL researchers. These experts, in turn, disseminate the information to reporters, and it reaches thousands of readers before it can be debunked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s a very effective way of getting duped,\u201d Donovan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ADL traced its original tip to posts on 4chan, where researchers found \u201cself-described ROF members\u201d claiming that Cruz was a brother-in-arms. But many of those posts seem to have been written specifically to deceive reporters and researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, an anonymous 4chan user posted about receiving a message on Instagram from an ABC News reporter after making a joke suggesting he knew Cruz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cPrime trolling opportunity,\u201d another user replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou have to take advantage of this,\u201d a third chimed in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He asked for proof of the reporter\u2019s identity, according to posted screenshots from their correspondence. The reporter provided an official email address and sent a photo of an ABC identification badge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some on the 4chan thread joked about sending back obscene photos, but others gave concrete tips for tricking the reporter:&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;\u201cKeep talking to her so she gains your trust\u201d; \u201cKeep this going be realistic ... say you have known him for years you met him on a Liberal Facebook page years ago and you have kept in touch\u201d; \u201cSay you are scared to tell her in case you get blamed, it will get her excited you know something big.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This particular 4chan user seems to have sent the reporter a racist cartoon and was quickly blocked. Many on the forum ripped into him for missing a \u201ca golden opportunity.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou could have told her the shooter took \u2018an unusual interest in islam lately,\u2019\u201d one user wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the trolls now had a shared objective: disseminate disinformation about Cruz. It\u2019s unclear when exactly they settled on a narrative that included Jereb and ROF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In posts to a neo-Nazi Web forum called The Right Stuff, a user called \u201cJordan Fash\u201d said the idea originated in a group chat on Discord, an app for gamers that is popular with white nationalists and the alt-right. (&amp;quot;Fash&amp;quot; is  common internet shorthand for &amp;quot;fascist.&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Jordan Fash, an ABC News reporter reached out to one of the group\u2019s members on Instagram. The group passed around her number and told her Cruz was associated with Jereb. Group members communicated with at least two ABC News reporters in a coordinated effort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their correspondence was not posted online in its entirety. In some of the posted exchanges, the reporters asked trolls to substantiate their stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not to suggest that you aren't being truthful, but it would be very helpful if you could let me know how you know that,&amp;quot; one of the ABC News reporters wrote to one person via Instagram, according to screenshots posted to 4chan on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt was common knowledge he did rallies with ROF, I frequently saw him conversing with Jordan Jereb in person,\u201d the person, whom the reporter addressed as &amp;quot;Ethan,&amp;quot; responded. Jordan Fash posted some of the same screenshots to The Right Stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI was there. These are screen caps taken from when this shirt started. 99% of it was done on the phone,\u201d Jordan Fash wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In posts to Gab, a social-networking site used by many in the alt-right, early Friday morning, one user said the Discord group \u201cspent around 18 hours orchestrating, contacting ABC, being interviewed by reporters, etc.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members swapped links to articles that identified Cruz as a member of ROF, celebrating each story and keeping a tally of media interview attempts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;ABC messaged me. Asked to use my name in this article,&amp;quot; wrote one user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is spreading like wildfire,&amp;quot; wrote another user, &amp;quot;Renegade,&amp;quot; after someone in the chat shared a link to the ADL blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;All it takes is a single article,&amp;quot; the first user wrote back. \u201cAnd everyone else picks up the story.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC News reported that its reporters spoke with three \u201cformer schoolmates\u201d of Cruz, but did not indicate whether these communications were over social media. A spokesperson for ABC News declined to comment on how its reporters vetted the identities of these purported acquaintances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, an AP spokesperson said, \u201cAP spoke with the leader of Republic of Florida, who said Cruz was a member of his group and had participated in exercises in Tallahassee. In the course of continued reporting, police and other groups were not able to confirm Cruz\u2019s association with the white nationalist militia, and that is what is reflected on the wire.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others in the Discord chat said they were contacted by a reporter from The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some point, the trolls started a \u201cconfessional\u201d 4chan thread dedicated to convincing readers that Cruz had been a member of ROF. The ADL confirmed this 4chan post was the one that led to their blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;After seeing that 4chan post, we called Jereb and he told us what he told us,&amp;quot; said an ADL spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI've kept quiet for long enough,\u201d reads the first anonymous message on the 4chan thread. \u201cI've decided that its time the world know the truth about ROF.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cNikolas Cruz was a revolutionary member of the Republic of Florida, who preached twisted and dark things like terrorism and attacking innocent people.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anonymous user claimed to be a former ROF member and posted a photo titled \u201cMe and nick.jpg,\u201d which depicted two men posing with the ROF flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another posted a blurry photo of ROF members that was seemingly &lt;a href=\"http://tallahasseeconcernedcitizen.blogspot.com/2015/07/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;taken from a blog&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to countering extremism in Tallahassee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the Discord chat, a user called Curbstomp suggested sharing generic photos of ROF and claiming they depicted Cruz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have an idea. ... We can just take a pic of masked ROF members and claim one of them is Cruz,&amp;quot; Curbstomp wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the Discord chat swapped potential photos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others joined the chorus on 4chan, interspersing jokes with purported confirmations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I can confirm this guy was trying to enact a race war and got kicked out of ROF,\u201d wrote another poster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s unclear how directly involved Jereb was in the deception effort. Jordan Fash wrote on The Right Stuff that Jereb sometimes \u201changs around\u201d in their Discord chats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The posted screenshots show a Discord user called \u201cThe Floridian\u201d who seems to claim membership in ROF and who recounts calls with the ADL and reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Its funny the ADL guy said 'I just want to warn you your group is going to be under scrutiny,'&amp;quot; The Floridian wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Also ABC called back they are having trouble verifying Nikolas envolvement,&amp;quot; The Floridian also wrote. ABC News reported speaking with Jereb directly, as did the AP, The Daily Beast, and other outlets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cROF now has a higher kill ratio than Atomwaffen,&amp;quot; The Floridian laughed in recounting the calls, referring to a small neo-Nazi group in Florida that is reportedly linked to several murders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Floridian also&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;claimed to have been contacted by \u201cthe feds.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I told the feds I have nothing to do with Cruz,&amp;quot; The Floridian wrote. &amp;quot;I told them it was a prank and that I was also confused.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jereb later seemed to deflect responsibility, calling it all a \u201clegit misunderstanding\u201d because ROF has multiple people named Nicholas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou realize I wasn't in on the prank? You realize I thought the information I was being given was legit?\u201d he wrote on Gab, suggesting that his fellow white nationalists owed him an apology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jereb did not respond to a phone message or an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the story spread even further, one Discord user posted a tweet from the AP: &amp;quot;BREAKING: Leader of white nationalist group has confirmed suspect in Florida school shooting was member of his organization.&amp;quot; It had been retweeted more than 35,000 times at that point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group crowed at such a quantifiable achievement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Those 35 thousand people aren't going to change their minds,&amp;quot; wrote one member, mocking those who would read the press coverage he and his friends concocted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They're lemmings. ... They will go to the grave convinced that the shooter was a white nationalist.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Thursday evening, 4chan users were celebrating their efforts, posting screenshots of their communications with reporters and faux posts pretending to be ROF members. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201c[T]hey are so hungry for a story that they'll just believe anything as long as its corroborated by a few people and seems legit,\u201d wrote the creator of one 4chan thread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donovan, the disinformation researcher, said reporters need to be more vigilant against these kinds of campaigns, which are  going to get only more common and more sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe have to start thinking of these white nationalist groups as what some of them describe themselves \u2014 \u2018media militias,\u2019\u201d said Donovan. \u201cThey think of media as adversarial territory.\u201d&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 20:13:48 GMT</pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>Shawn Musgrave</dc:creator>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/florida-shooting-white-nationalists-415672</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>White House: Florida shooter 'obviously' shouldn't have had 'that weapon'</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/florida-shooting-weapon-white-house-415663</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A top White House spokesperson said Friday the suspected shooter who killed 17 at a Florida high school &amp;quot;obviously&amp;quot; shouldn't have been able to legally obtain the weapon he used in the deadly onslaught.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah was pressed on whether President Donald Trump felt it was right that Nikolas Cruz, the alleged gunman who opened fire on students and staffers in Parkland on Wednesday, was able to legally obtain the AR-15 assault-style rifle he is accused of using in the shooting at the age of 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIn this instance, this individual did obtain the weapon through a legal background check,&amp;quot; Shah told Fox News. &amp;quot;We don\u2019t know all the circumstances surrounding it, but obviously he shouldn\u2019t have had that weapon and shouldn\u2019t have been able to do the kinds of things that he did.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah did not specify what limits should have been imposed to keep someone like Cruz from obtaining such a gun. But he added: \u201cWith that being said, there\u2019s a whole host of issues surrounding this matter from mental health to school safety and a range of other things we\u2019re going to be looking at.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president notably failed to mention guns in a national address on Thursday in response to the fatal shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, emphasizing instead the need to  deal with mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe are committed to working with state and local leaders to help secure our schools and tackle the difficult issue of mental health,&amp;quot; Trump said in his first public appearance in the aftermath of  Wednesday's shooting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratic lawmakers responded to the shooting by issuing calls for increased regulations on guns, but Republican officials argued against the push. Legislation to beef up gun laws have repeatedly stalled in Congress in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah on Friday stressed that &amp;quot;in the wake of tragedies you have to look at everything,&amp;quot; but also cautioned officials to not overreach and infringe on citizens' constitutional right to bear arms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 16:12:32 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>clima@politico.com (Cristiano Lima)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/florida-shooting-weapon-white-house-415663</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Our Children Deserve Better Than This</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/17/parkland-shooting-children-gun-control-217021</link>\n      <description>The survivors of the Parkland massacre are take action to stop mass shootings.

Five years after Sandy Hook, nearly 20 years after Columbine, what Garry Wills memorably called \u201c&lt;a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2012/12/15/our-moloch/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;our Moloch&lt;/a&gt;\u201d is still our Moloch; we still sacrifice our children to the Gun God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So much of what we witnessed last week in south Florida has become familiar to us, from the initial shock of the news to the helicopter views of the campus to the eyewitness accounts of survivors to the grief of the parents to the grim body count to the terse announcements by overwhelmed law enforcement officials to the trite expressions of remorse from complicit politicians. And always in that parade of horribles there is the grief and the frustration and the anger and the senseless of it all. This week\u2019s shooter, for example, reportedly managed to get off 150 rounds with his AR-15, a weapon he lawfully purchased in the same society that deems him too young, too immature, to order a beer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the aftermath of the shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland was different from all its tragic predecessors in one sense. For once, the&lt;a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/what-does-donald-trump-have-to-say-to-the-parkland-parent-lori-alhadeff/amp?__twitter_impression=true\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; sorrow and rage&lt;/a&gt; offered by adults immediately was drowned out by the wrath and the reason of their children. No longer willing to be sacrificed for some hoary constitutional theory, one surviving student after another,&lt;a href=\"https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/us/columbine-mass-shootings.html?referer=https://t.co/W7irONRWu2?amp=1#click=https://t.co/W7irONRWu2\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; born in the shadow of Columbine&lt;/a&gt;, from the moment of the attack and for days afterward,&lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-loud-new-voice-after-the-latest-school-shooting-kids-wanting-to-know-why-adults-hadnt-done-more/2018/02/15/48b3903e-1298-11e8-9065-e55346f6de81_story.html?utm_term=.150b0c2cac18\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; relentlessly and courageously&lt;/a&gt; called out their parents and their politicians and their president for failing to do what every child has a right to expect from all of us every day: protect them from danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These teenagers, our children,&lt;a href=\"https://nymag.com/selectall/2018/02/florida-shooting-survivors-drag-trump-and-tomi-on-twitter.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; blasted&lt;/a&gt; President Trump and state and federal lawmakers on Twitter and on television, for the uselessness and hypocrisy of the \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d some politicians lamely trot out still when these massacres occur. These kids, these eloquent kids, stared straight into cameras,&lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/the-students-at-floridas-douglas-high-are-amazing-communicators-that-could-save-lives/2018/02/16/b059bd1c-1333-11e8-9570-29c9830535e5_story.html?utm_term=.2c2a77bf5535\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; like professionals&lt;/a&gt;, to deliver their&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/boothheather/status/964581627392397312\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; blunt message&lt;/a&gt;: Get your acts together, stop posturing and pretending gun violence is a problem that cannot be solved, and come up with new policies that could keep just one more American family from having to bear the unbearable burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children, students, like David Hogg,&lt;a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/the-powerful-calls-to-action-by-the-teen-age-survivors-of-the-parkland-school-shooting\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; who said just hours after the attack&lt;/a&gt;: \u201cWe are children. You guys are the adults. Work together, come over your politics, and get something done.\u201d A student journalist, Hogg had the presence of mind, incredibly, to interview his fellow students &lt;i&gt;while they all were cowering from the gunman&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;a href=\"http://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/crime/article200242224.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; Those raw interviews&lt;/a&gt; are more important to the debate about guns in America than any pontification from a Second Amendment zealot or the craven politicians who enable them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hogg wasn\u2019t alone. There was Guillermo Bogan, who railed against the gun industry. \u201cSome people will just do anything for a dollar,\u201d he said at a vigil for the victims. \u201cThere should be a background check\u2014are you mentally ill or are you not mentally ill?\u201d And there was \u201cCarly,\u201d&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/car_nove/status/964122342464081921\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; who tweeted&lt;/a&gt; in response to a particularly odious commentator. \u201cI was hiding in a closet for 2 hours. It was about guns. You weren\u2019t there. You don\u2019t know how it felt. Guns give these disgusting people the ability to kill other human beings. This IS about guns.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nation turns its lonely eyes to eloquent victims in moments like these. But there are countless other child victims and survivors of gun violence whose voices are no less eloquent but which aren\u2019t amplified by cable news shows and the crush of media coverage that comes from a mass shooting like this. Kids like Kavan Collins, of Chicago, who at the age of five&lt;a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-chicago-shootings-violence-20171219-story.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; already has been struck twice by a bullet&lt;/a&gt;. Or students at Excel Academy in Baltimore, where at least&lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/us/baltimore-murder-rate.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; seven students have been murdered&lt;/a&gt; in the past 16 months. Or little boys like Chris Hill, in Cleveland,&lt;a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/2017/09/15/road-rage-a-bullet-to-the-head-and-the-frantic-effort-to-save-a-4-year-old/?utm_term=.0ac96cb334c2\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; shot in a drive-by&lt;/a&gt; while he rode in the back of his mother\u2019s car. Or kids trying to grow up in Wilmington, Delaware,&lt;a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/09/08/wilmington-delaware-leads-u-s-teen-shootings/619458001/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; which leads the nation in teenager shootings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their stories, like the stories from Parkland this week, coalesce to make meaning of the statistics that are hard to understand in the abstract. The truth is, something equivalent to the mass shooting we just experienced happens &lt;i&gt;every day&lt;/i&gt; in America. Every day in this country of guns and madness and talking heads arguing over the Second Amendment &lt;a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/2017/09/15/road-rage-a-bullet-to-the-head-and-the-frantic-effort-to-save-a-4-year-old/?utm_term=.a722684f42b9\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;about two dozen children&lt;/a&gt;, our kids, our neighbors\u2019 kids, our grandkids, are killed or wounded by guns. That figure comes from 2015 statistics, the most recently available. Anyone want to bet against the notion that the figure only got worse in 2016 and 2017?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it\u2019s a mass shooting. Sometimes it\u2019s an accident. Sometimes it\u2019s the brutal reality of the dangerous neighborhoods we refuse to fix. Everyday a Columbine. Everyday a Parkland. Everyday a Virginia Tech. Thoughts and prayers and candlelight vigils and longform news coverage when the body count gets high enough. Maybe a local news report or two when it\u2019s just a single child gunned down on a street. Maybe nothing when a kid finds his parent\u2019s gun and&lt;a href=\"http://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/crime/article189898089.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; accidentally shoots himself in the head&lt;/a&gt;. The survivors of these senseless acts have a right to be as angry as the teenagers who survived Parkland this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our children deserve so much more than we have been able or willing to give them. And more and more now, recognizing our futility, our shameless ineptitude, they are giving us warning that they intend to fix what we cannot. I hope they can. As quickly as they can. And that when they do, they have the grace to forgive the rest of us for failing them so often in so many corners and classrooms of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 20:36:11 GMT</pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>Andrew Cohen</dc:creator>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/17/parkland-shooting-children-gun-control-217021</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Week 39: Mueller Puts Up a Big Score</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/17/week-39-217019</link>\n      <description>Thirteen Russians monkeyed with election, new indictment alleges. But still no proof Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The giant scrim that shields special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s work from Washington\u2019s nosy parkers opened slightly on Friday afternoon as he handed down an &lt;a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;indictment&lt;/a&gt;, charging 13 Russians and three Russian organizations with monkeywrenching the U.S. political process. Starting as early as 2014, these Russians used false and stolen identities to stage pro-Trump and anti-Clinton political rallies, recruit unwitting individuals (some in the Trump campaign) to populate their political Potemkin village, attract hundreds of thousands of followers on social media, and freckle the Web with countless agitprop advertisements (e.g., \u201cDonald wants to defeat terrorism \u2026 Hillary wants to sponsor it\u201d) that tens of millions of users saw. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By September 2016, the operation had a monthly budget of $1.25 million. The scenario described in the indictment\u2014Russians traveling through the United States (\u201cNevada, California, New Mexico, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, Louisiana, Texas, and New York\u201d) on travel visas \u201cto gather intelligence\u201d sounds like any number of paranoid B-movie thrillers from the 1950s where Commie agents seduce and then activate American dupes. In the 2016 update, the Russians, posing as American activists, would prod genuine Americans, some with real ties to grassroots organizations, to echo their political slogans. Using the Twitter ID of @March_for_Trump, for example, the Russians recruited and paid an unwitting American to pose at a West Palm Beach rally as Hillary Clinton but dressed in a prison uniform. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the indicted is &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/world/europe/prigozhin-russia-indictment-mueller.html?smid=tw-nytimesworld&amp;amp;smtyp=cur\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Yevgeny V. Prigozhin&lt;/a&gt;, described by the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;as one of Vladimir Putin\u2019s crony oligarchs. The 37-page indictment accuses Prigozhin of controlling the Internet Research Agency, the Russian cybershop that launched thousands of political trolls in the last election cycle. Prigozhin told the &lt;i&gt;Times &lt;/i&gt;he was too busy to be interviewed about the indictment. Speaking on Russian radio, he &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/16/robert-mueller-russians-charged-election\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, \u201cThe Americans are really impressionable people, they see what they want to see. I have great respect for them. If they want to see the devil\u2014let them see him.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Trump foes and fans craved\u2014and did not get today\u2014was a sign from Mueller of whether the president and the Russians had actively partnered in the election. In a brief &lt;a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?441317-1/deputy-attorney-general-rod-rosenstein-announces-indictment-russian-nationals&amp;amp;start=30\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt; announcing the indictment, deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was all about wiggle room on the topic. \u201cThere is no allegation in this indictment any American had any knowledge\u201d of the Russian adventure, Rosenstein said. Reporters hung on the phrase \u201cin this indictment,\u201d interpreting it to mean that a future indictment might make such a link. There was no equivocation or hinting when he asserted that the Russian interference had &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; altered the election\u2019s outcome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump found he had been exonerated by the indictment, immediately &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/964594780088033282\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;citing&lt;/a&gt; the Russian operation\u2019s timeline in a tweet. \u201cRussia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President. The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!\u201d he wrote. Trump\u2019s inexhaustible powers of self-exoneration dazzle at junctures like this one. Mr. Rosenstein might not have wanted to attempt the quadruple lutz-triple toe loop combo in live competition, but I\u2019ve got no such fear. So allow me to add a few annotations to your timeline, Mr. President, that bend it back in the collusion direction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a May 2013 &lt;a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2013/05/27/trump-researching-2016-run/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Post &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;article, your attorney Michael Cohen said you had already spent $1 million researching a 2016 run for the presidency. In November 2013, you were doing business in Moscow at your Miss Universe pageant, where coincidentally or not you met publicly with &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-trumps-financial-ties-to-russia-and-his-unusual-flattery-of-vladimir-putin/2016/06/17/dbdcaac8-31a6-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html?utm_term=.3e36b6ef1247\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Aras Agalarov and Emin Agalarov&lt;/a&gt;. The Agalarovs, we all recall, figured in the memorable &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/eighth-person-in-trump-tower-meeting-is-identified/2017/07/18/e971234a-6bce-11e7-9c15-177740635e83_story.html?utm_term=.d4c64662afca\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt; Trump Tower meeting between your son, your son-in-law, and the now-indicted Paul Manafort, and a bevy of Russians who came bearing dirt on Hillary Clinton. George Papadopoulos, derided as a mere coffee boy by his detractors in the Trump campaign, was caught gossiping in Europe about &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/us/politics/how-fbi-russia-investigation-began-george-papadopoulos.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;dirt on Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; the Russians had allegedly procured. Carter Page, another Trump campaign functionary, seems to have assumed a posture toward the Russians that made him the object of U.S. government surveillance. And who knows what the rumored plea deal Rick Gates is swinging will reveal. None of this, obviously, proves collusion, but, Mr. President, perhaps you should muffle your protest by 50 or 60 decibels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indictments stand as a prosecutorial codicil to the intelligence community\u2019s January 2017 &lt;a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on attempted Russian hacking of the 2016 election. As &lt;i&gt;Mother Jones &lt;/i&gt;reporter David Corn &lt;a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/02/muellers-latest-indictment-shows-trump-has-helped-putin-cover-up-a-crime/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;, the Moscow offensive had three components: a social media assault; the hacking of the Democratic Party\u2019s emails; and the penetration of state voting systems. Whether you think the Trump campaign colluded with Russians or not\u2014and I\u2019m still waiting for the convincing evidence\u2014it seems undeniable Putin\u2019s people injected as much Trump-favoring chaos as they could into the campaign. That the president merely shrugs at the Russian file that America\u2019s spooks and the FBI and Mueller\u2019s investigators have presented to him should make us want to raise by 50 or 60 decibels the volume of our questions to him. How can he find the flimsy &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/03/week-37-216932\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Nunes memo&lt;/a&gt; convincing, but kiss-off the Russian shenanigans with &lt;a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-russia-indictments/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;press release platitudes&lt;/a&gt; about our need to \u201cunite as Americans\u201d? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian interference in U.S. politics continues, as CIA Director Mike Pompeo, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/us/politics/russia-sees-midterm-elections-as-chance-to-sow-fresh-discord-intelligence-chiefs-warn.html?rref=collection%2Fnewseventcollection%2Frussian-election-hacking&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;contentCollection=politics&amp;amp;region=stream&amp;amp;module=stream_unit&amp;amp;version=latest&amp;amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;amp;pgtype=collection\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;informed&lt;/a&gt; the Senate Intelligence Committee this week. \u201cRussia perceives its past efforts as successful and views the 2018 U.S. midterm elections as a potential target for Russian influence operations,\u201d Coats said. \u201cThroughout the entire community, we have not seen any evidence of any significant change from last year.\u201d Most recently, Russia has been using bots to help shape news, painting the FBI and the Department of Justice as partisan shops. Russian propaganda is scary, but how effective is it in changing opinions? Not very, concluded Dartmouth College professor Brendan Nyhan in a &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/upshot/fake-news-and-bots-may-be-worrisome-but-their-political-power-is-overblown.html?rref=collection%2Fnewseventcollection%2Frussian-election-hacking&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;contentCollection=politics&amp;amp;region=stream&amp;amp;module=stream_unit&amp;amp;version=latest&amp;amp;contentPlacement=3&amp;amp;pgtype=collection\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In part one of a promised series, the Intercept's James Risen posits that Trump is a liar, a racist, a misogynist, a demagogue and a narcissist. But, he asks, \u201c&lt;a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/02/16/trump-russia-election-hacking-investigation/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Is Donald Trump a Traitor?&lt;/a&gt;\u201d A former &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;intelligence beat reporter, Risen understands the long-running war between Russian spies and American spies as well as anybody, so his observation that the Russians may \u201chave pulled off the most consequential covert action operation since Germany put Lenin on a train back to Petrograd in 1917,\u201d deserves our scrutiny. For Risen, the Trump-Russia story reduces to four basic questions: Did Russia intervene in the election to help Trump win? Did Trump or his people work with the Russians to win the election? Have Trump and his people obstructed the federal investigation of that collusion? And, are Republican efforts to discredit the Mueller investigation part of a criminal conspiracy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, who among us can read the Mueller indictments and other evidence without concluding that the Russian sided heavily with Trump and consistently opposed Clinton? \u201c[U]se any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump\u2014we support them),\u201d reads a February 2016 Russian planning document cited in the indictment. But how many of us are ready for the reveal that Trump\u2019s forces worked with the Russians or that Trump and the Republicans obstructed justice? The thought stuns at first pass. It induces the gag reflex at the second. Is this what it\u2019s like to watch a flood sweep away your home\u2019s foundation? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;******&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;KAOS was the name of the international organization of evil that Maxwell Smart battled for five seasons on NBC's &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Smart\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Get Smart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; in the 1960s.

But the Afrofuturist, anti-imperialist worldview the series espouses makes it perfect for the moment.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019ve been to a movie  theater at any point in the past 20 years, there is a steep statistical probability that you have been exposed in some way to one of the 10 films in Marvel Comics\u2019 &lt;i&gt;X-Men &lt;/i&gt;franchise (and if you haven\u2019t, don\u2019t worry\u2014another three are on the way by the end of next year). The series\u2019 mythos is well-established in the public imagination, its group of titular misfits shunned by society in an easy-to-digest, civil rights-era parable of tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years after their first appearance in 1963, however, Marvel moved beyond the allegorical and introduced  its first  black superhero in the Black Panther. And if you\u2019ve been on the internet at any point over the past 12 months, you\u2019ve likely noticed the intensifying hype around that hero\u2019s upcoming film, the 18th in Marvel Studios\u2019 endless procession of world-beating blockbusters. With a nostalgist in the White House who seems to relish sticking his finger in the country\u2019s open wound of racial grievance, it\u2019s easy to understand why a big-budget, black-directed superhero film featuring an almost entirely black cast would be cause for celebration. But its appeal doesn\u2019t lie solely in backlash. &lt;i&gt;Black Panther &lt;/i&gt;may have never sold as many copies as &lt;i&gt;Spider-Man &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;The Incredible Hulk&lt;/i&gt;, but the series\u2019 history and politics are as rich and unique as either, if not more so\u2014and they explain how this moment helped poise a formerly second-string hero to shatter box-office records.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;***&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Panther first appeared in July 1966, in the pages of Marvel\u2019s tent-pole &lt;i&gt;Fantastic Four &lt;/i&gt;series. The Fantastic Four, like the Panther, were the creation of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the Romulus and Remus of Marvel\u2019s creation myth, who with their Cleaver-esque squareness embodied the gee-whiz, jet-age ethos of the comic book world at the time. Lee and Kirby\u2014both of them white men\u2014played off that sharply occidental viewpoint in their introduction of the Black Panther, in which the Four travel to his African kingdom, in a regrettable yet revealing turn of phrase, \u201ca Tarzan movie,\u201d and instead find a futuristic enclave hidden deep in the jungle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That enclave was Wakanda, a fictional nation in East Africa that had eluded the colonization that ravaged its neighbors. In Lee and Kirby\u2019s telling, Wakanda developed into a hidden techno-utopia by jealously hoarding its supply of vibranium, a fictional mineral that among other things serves as the prime component of Captain America\u2019s unbreakable shield. Wakanda is portrayed in those first issues as a mixture of exoticist tropes and high futurism, an African nation that, free from the depredations of colonial rule, was able to develop into the rival, and likely superior, of any Western power while retaining its African culture and traditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee has claimed that he created the character because during the civil rights era he saw a need for black superheroes; previously, black people in mainstream comics had been consigned to supporting roles. Although, as with many of their famous co-creations, his exact authorship of the character is disputed in proportion to that of the more politically outspoken Kirby, the impact it had was undeniable, as journalist, historian and current &lt;i&gt;Black Panther &lt;/i&gt;writer Ta-Nehisi Coates described in an &lt;a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2016/04/06/473224606/a-reluctant-king-ta-nehisi-coates-takes-on-marvels-black-panther\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with NPR:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t think people should lose sight of what it meant to create an African, a black superhero in the 1960s,\u201d Coates said. \u201cIt happens within the midst of the civil rights movement, but I think if you search pop culture at that particular time for somebody like the Black Panther, you would come up really short. If you compare it to other areas of other pop culture, Marvel was probably pretty much ahead.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the character\u2019s early years, his political significance was mostly symbolic, rarely touching directly on real-world issues (an exception being a 1971 one-off  in which the Panther and the Fantastic Four fight a thinly veiled stand-in for the South African apartheid regime\u2014the former under the name Black Leopard so as to avoid confusion, in the character\u2019s own words, with the Black Panther Party). He made guest appearances in popular series, joining the Avengers for a time, but didn\u2019t truly come into his own until writer and editor Don McGregor expanded on the mythology of Wakanda in the epic \u201cPanther\u2019s Rage\u201d arc that began in a 1973 edition of the unfortunately named &lt;i&gt;Jungle Action &lt;/i&gt;anthology. What had previously been an indelible but thinly sketched vision of an African sci-fi fantasia became under McGregor\u2019s pen\u2014and the pencils of those including pioneering black artist Billy Graham\u2014a fully fleshed-out world unlike anything else in comics, replete with its own political, cultural and spiritual lore and populated by complex characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world of \u201cPanther\u2019s Rage\u201d was intellectually robust by the standards of any contemporaneous superhero comic, but for black characters to be portrayed with such depth and diversity of experience&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;was groundbreaking, as the late writer-producer Dwayne McDuffie wrote of his experience reading it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe Black Panther was nobody\u2019s sidekick and if there was any rescuing to do, he\u2019d take care of it himself, thank you,\u201d McDuffie wrote in 2010 on his now-defunct website. \u201cMoreover, the Black Panther was king of a mythical African country where black people were visible in every position in society, soldier, doctor, philosopher, street sweeper, ambassador\u2014suddenly everything was possible. In the space of 15 pages, black people moved from invisible to inevitable.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDuffie compared the Black Panther favorably to characters like Luke Cage, a blaxploitation-inspired hero of the early  '70s who occupied a stereotypically scummy New York City.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Although the character has deepened in the intervening decades, recently starring in a Netflix series of his own, McDuffie wrote that he couldn\u2019t relate to aspects of the book like the \u201cbizarre version of \u2018street slang\u2019\u201d that was penned for Cage\u2019s dialogue by (white) writer Archie Goodwin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Black Panther of the era was singular for its time, an Afrocentric mythology created from whole cloth that equaled that of long-standing white characters like Thor. But unlike Thor, the Black Panther was often explicitly political. Under McGregor\u2019s authorship, the character tackled issues from American white supremacy to crack cocaine while maintaining the integrity of the fictional world he had created. An entire arc traced the Panther\u2019s crusade against the Ku Klux Klan in Georgia, the home state of his African-American girlfriend Monica Lynne. The Panther, investigating the murder of Lynne\u2019s sister, discovers a nefarious Klan-led plot, and stark illustrations of the Panther freeing himself from burning crosses and thumping white-hooded thugs gave the book a jarringly topical edge while it remained grounded in a story of family and loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McGregor relinquished the pen in the early '90s, and the character floated in stasis for several years until taken up in a critically acclaimed 1998 series by Christopher Priest. Priest, a polymathic writer, musician and minister whose history with Marvel stretched back to the '70s and included a stint as mainstream comics\u2019 first black editor, built on the scaffolding put in place by McGregor over the preceding decades, and Coates has repeatedly cited his run as an inspiration for his current work with the character. He established the Panther as a major power player in the Marvel universe, a Batman-esque mastermind always several chess moves ahead of even his allies. His Panther was a statesman both at home and abroad; Priest\u2019s genius was in expanding the character\u2019s footprint while deepening the Wakandan mythology and spinning a uniquely Afrocentric political thriller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;***&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cultural critic Mark Dery coined the term \u201cAfrofuturism\u201d in a 1993 essay, referring to the loosely defined common characteristics of black science fiction in art spanning from Sun Ra\u2019s experimental jazz to the novels of Octavia Butler. Author and UCLA professor Tananarive Due recently described its unique function in the African diaspora as a \u201creimagining of race, racial constructs, history \u2026 and liberation themes, through what we call a speculative lens.\u201d &lt;i&gt;Black Panther&lt;/i&gt;, both the comic series and the film, falls squarely on this continuum, as has been noted in &lt;a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/59k9k8/what-is-afrofuturism-in-marvels-black-panther\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://comicsalliance.com/afrofuturism-black-panther/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;features&lt;/a&gt; leading up to the movie\u2019s release. Due, on a recent podcast appearance, discussed Afro-futurism\u2019s galvanizing effect in providing representations of black \u201cpower, technological prowess, courage, family [and] community.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upcoming&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;film is the most prominent example of the phenomenon thus far, directed and co-written by &lt;i&gt;Fruitvale Station &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Creed &lt;/i&gt;auteur Ryan Coogler with the full production and marketing strength of the Disney-industrial complex behind him. It pits the Panther, portrayed by Chadwick Boseman, against Erik Killmonger (portrayed by frequent Coogler collaborator Michael B. Jordan), an American rival and mercenary who aims to usurp his throne and foment a global revolution. Killmonger, a creation of McGregor\u2019s from the \u201cPanther\u2019s Rage\u201d arc, was a Wakandan in his telling, but Coogler described in a recent &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2018/02/14/black-panthers-ryan-coogler-has-always-been-searching-for-superheroes-that-look-like-him/?utm_term=.321d92fa5ee4\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Washington Post interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; how he along with co-writer Joe Robert Cole and Jordan crafted the character to reflect a uniquely African-American perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film, then, doesn\u2019t shy away from the comic\u2019s political undertones, as Vann Newkirk in &lt;i&gt;The Atlantic &lt;/i&gt;deftly draws out in an &lt;a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/02/the-provocation-and-power-of-black-panther/553226/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; that connects the anti-colonial spirit of Wakanda to pan-African icons like Haile Selassie and Marcus Garvey. Lee and Kirby\u2019s germ of an idea\u2014a highly advanced African world power, so counterintuitive to their Eurocentric, Cold War-era point of view\u2014developed in the hands of artists like McGregor, Priest and Coates into a robust and sui generis Afrocentric mythology. World-building contributions from writers like Roxane Gay and Evan Narcisse are currently fleshing out that mythology in companion series, in ways by which Dwayne McDuffie, who found the isolated stereotype of Luke Cage so demoralizing, likely would have been thrilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the resonance of &lt;i&gt;Black Panther &lt;/i&gt;in this moment it\u2019s perhaps effective to compare it to another politically charged \u201cevent\u201d film, Paul Feig\u2019s 2016 &lt;i&gt;Ghostbusters &lt;/i&gt;reboot. The &lt;i&gt;Ghostbusters &lt;/i&gt;franchise, while massively popular, bore no sociopolitical significance, unless you count William Atherton\u2019s unflattering portrayal of an EPA busybody who forces the crew to release  its ghosts back into the air. Feig\u2019s seemingly innocuous decision to reinvent the four male leads as women opened a nasty rift in internet nerd culture, for lack of a better term, with a largely male fan base complaining of the intrusion of \u201cidentity politics\u201d into what they had presumed their exclusive domain. Much of the media picked up that ball and ran with it, positioning the film as a timely girl-power extravaganza during the first female-led presidential campaign, but much like that campaign it failed to galvanize the public, ending up a relative box office dud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But where the &lt;i&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/i&gt; reboot failed to develop an organic groundswell, &lt;i&gt;Black Panther &lt;/i&gt;already&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;carries decades of political and social significance as a franchise. The character is relatively new to those who aren\u2019t comic-book junkies, but from his first appearance in 2016\u2019s &lt;i&gt;Captain America: Civil War &lt;/i&gt;it became clear that the release of this year\u2019s film would be, as Carvell Wallace described in a &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/magazine/why-black-panther-is-a-defining-moment-for-black-america.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;beautiful New York Times Magazine essay&lt;/a&gt;, \u201ca defining moment for black America.\u201d Superhero films starring black actors like Wesley Snipes\u2019 &lt;i&gt;Blade &lt;/i&gt;and Will Smith\u2019s &lt;i&gt;Hancock&lt;/i&gt;, along with several others,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;have been lauded in their own right, but Wallace describes their heroes\u2019 race as \u201cincidental\u201d in contrast to &lt;i&gt;Black Panther&lt;/i&gt;\u2019s being \u201csteeped very specifically and purposefully in its blackness.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in a rebuttal of stodgy industry heads and skeptics who might have doubted the salability of an unapologetically Afrocentric blockbuster, &lt;i&gt;Black Panther&lt;/i&gt; seems poised to follow in those films\u2019 footsteps and then some. Relentless social media buzz and an inescapable marketing campaign that even saw Kendrick Lamar revive the once-thought-dead &lt;a href=\"http://www.thefader.com/2018/01/31/black-panther-soundtrack-tracklist-kendrick-lamar-tde\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;soundtrack tie-in&lt;/a&gt; has put the film on track for a $165 million opening weekend, according to &lt;a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/black-panther-tracking-massive-165m-us-debut-1083867\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The better part of the past decade has been dominated by a debate over the worthiness of black lives, and the extent to which the sitting president is a racist is debated almost daily by news outlets that previously would have considered using the label unthinkable. It doesn\u2019t take a genius like the Panther himself to see why black audiences have tipped this film from a run-of-the-mill superhero blockbuster to a bona-fide social event. Where some see the hope, optimism and wonder that UCLA professor Due described in Afrofuturist art in short supply, &lt;i&gt;Black Panther&lt;/i&gt;\u2019s story was almost ready-made to provide it to the massive audience it\u2019s set to enjoy this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 22:02:33 GMT</pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>Derek Robertson</dc:creator>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/15/how-the-quietly-radical-black-panther-took-over-hollywood-217009</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Trump\u2019s Food Stamp Idea Is Like Blue Apron Had a Socialist Hangover</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/15/trump-food-stamps-harvest-box-blue-apron-snap-217004</link>\n      <description>The administration\u2019s 'Harvest Box' proposal is more about the welfare of agribusiness than the poor.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It was a marriage of \u201cthe best of the humanitarian instincts of the American people [and] the best of the free enterprise system,\u201d &lt;a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=26472\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;said President Lyndon Johnson&lt;/a&gt; in 1964, a way to combat hunger that would give recipients the ability to make their own food choices while avoiding a giant, Soviet-style food distribution scheme: food stamps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, some 46 million Americans with low incomes receive food stamps\u2019 modern incarnation \u2014 electronic benefits transfers from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. EBT cards in hand, recipients have some choice in the  food they will eat instead of the government deciding for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could all change. On Monday, the Trump administration issued a vague proposal to &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/12/food-stamps-trump-administration-343245\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;replace more than 40 percent&lt;/a&gt; of SNAP benefits given to recipients with a Harvest Box containing shelf-stable foods selected and distributed by the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the proposal was devoid of specifics \u2014 &lt;i&gt;What about recipients who are allergic to the foods chosen for them? Parents with children who are fussy eaters? People with dietary restrictions? Who would box and deliver the food? Wouldn\u2019t this all be much more expensive than an EBT transfer? &lt;/i&gt;\u2014 it would be a mistake to laugh this off as some ill-considered idea that will soon be forgotten. Ideas like this have already become policy; indeed, we regularly ship the equivalent of Harvest Boxes to the poor overseas. Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly not in the service of any free-market ideal. It is hardly pro-market to displace the private sector and build a parallel, state-run distribution system, no matter how many times you name-check Blue Apron. This is the sort of thing you find in countries still recovering from socialist hangovers. India\u2019s government, for example, buys more than 30 percent of the country\u2019s grain output at above-market prices and then sells it to consumers at below-market prices through ration shops. Emulating that approach by delivering the food in a box is hardly an innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, the Harvest Box approach to hunger policy makes sense only in the context of hunger politics. And hunger politics have always been as much about the welfare of agribusiness as about the welfare of the poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider international food aid. We regularly ship food produced here in the U.S. overseas for delivery to refugees and others at risk of hunger and malnutrition. This food makes up a meaningful share of America\u2019s overall foreign aid (8 percent in 2013), yet the data suggest it is an inefficient approach: It is generally more expensive than buying food locally and distributing it or simply giving the recipients cash or vouchers to purchase their own food. &lt;a href=\"http://www.ifpri.org/event/cash-food-or-vouchers\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Rigorous experimental testing&lt;/a&gt; has shown that it does not even produce systematically better nutritional outcomes than giving out money. And it is a poorly kept secret that in many cases, the international food-aid recipients simply sell the food we give them and buy something else anyway, in which case the whole exercise amounts to little more than a very slow and expensive wire transfer (e.g. in &lt;a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Multi-SectorNeedsAssessement%28MSNA%29ofSyrianRefugeesinCampsSeptember2014KurdistanRegionIraq.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of which is why humanitarian agencies are making a concerted effort to shift from the Harvest Box approach of food aid, and toward unrestricted cash transfers instead. There is, in the &lt;a href=\"http://www.cashlearning.org/downloads/calp-sowc-report-web.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;words&lt;/a&gt; of Jan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council, \u201cno longer serious dispute about whether cash can significantly improve humanitarian aid.\u201d&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is serious doubt that it will. At the end of the day, agencies can only distribute what funders give them. And to fight hunger and malnutrition, we continue to give them food purchased from U.S. producers and transported on U.S. ships. Both the Bush and Obama administrations proposed reforms to this system which would have allowed aid agencies to distribute more cash, or at least to buy food locally in the areas they work, or to relax the requirement that food be shipped on more expensive U.S. carriers. Both administrations\u2019 moves were largely &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/jun/20/us-congress-bill-food-aid\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; by Congress under pressure from the &lt;a href=\"http://usamaritime.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/USA_Maritime_WhiteSheetFY14BudgetProposal.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;shipping&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://usamaritime.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/FarmBureauStatement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;agribusiness lobbies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can similarly see the farm lobby\u2019s influence on the way the U.S. helps its own citizens. Food stamps are administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture largely because when they were &lt;a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/short-history-snap\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;first created&lt;/a&gt; during the Great Depression, it was in part to dispose of surplus commodities that the USDA had accumulated through its farm-support programs. The U.S. is hardly alone in this. As leading food security scholar Christopher Barrett &lt;a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574007202100272\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;concludes&lt;/a&gt;, in most countries, \u201cthe quantity and type of food available has historically been driven primarily by the patterns of surpluses generated by farm support programs, not by recipient need.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most telling is the way that evidence on the impact of food stamps here in the U.S. has &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; altered policy. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the USDA commissioned a series of rigorous, randomized controlled trials examining what would happen if people received money instead of food stamps. The tests showed that those who received money spent a bit more on housing and clothing and a bit less on food, but their malnutrition rates were no worse than those on food stamps. Overall, the &lt;a href=\"https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/CashOutFoodUse_Summary.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; seemed positive\u2014at least from the point of view of the recipients, but overall, policy did not change as a result. Instead, the key lesson drawn from these studies was that people who got food stamps spent more on food; food stamps were better than cash transfers\u2014not for low-income households, but for agribusiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, it is remarkable that the present-day incarnation of food stamps, delivered via EBT, gives recipients so much flexibility to buy the food they want instead of the food the farm industry wishes to dispose of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, of course, is what Harvest Boxes would change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One week after President Trump took office, a consortium of 10 of the largest agricultural lobby groups &lt;a href=\"https://www.usarice.com/docs/default-source/government-affairs/usa-rice-signed-letters/commodities-food-aid-letter-to-president-trump.pdf?sfvrsn=2\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;wrote to him,&lt;/a&gt; lamenting that their subsidies had been \u201crelentlessly attacked by previous administrations,\u201d and urging him to \u201cprioritize the use of American-grown in-kind commodity contributions\u201d in fighting hunger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Harvest Box is any indication, their pleas have found a receptive ear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 20:39:09 GMT</pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>Michael Faye</dc:creator>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/15/trump-food-stamps-harvest-box-blue-apron-snap-217004</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Midterm Limits: Why Democrats Shouldn\u2019t Get Too Confident About November</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/15/midterm-election-democrats-trump-216978</link>\n      <description>You may think the party of an unpopular president always gets clobbered, but history teaches otherwise.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There are two assertions about midterm elections that are endlessly recited with firm confidence. First, the president\u2019s party almost always loses seats in Congress in midterm elections, and second, the fate of the president\u2019s party is directly tied to his or her approval ratings. Yet there are rarely mentioned, but significant, caveats to these putative iron laws of politics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first is that aggregate numbers can be misleading. If you do the math, you find that in the last 21 midterms, the party holding the White House lost an average of 31 seats. But this is like saying the average wealth of Jeff Bezos and nine insolvent people is $10 billion. The \u201caverage midterm loss\u201d conflates massive defeats with insignificant changes in the congressional landscape that left the president little or none the worse for wear\u2014and in a few cases even improved his lot. And second, it obscures the fact that there are very different reasons for some of the biggest defeats suffered by a president\u2019s party. When the president gets a \u201cshellacking,\u201d as President Barack Obama memorably put it after Democrats\u2019 2010 midterm wipeout, it\u2019s not always obvious his unpopularity is the sole or dominant reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s true that the three most recent midterms have brought gloom to the White House. In 2006, the Republicans lost both houses of Congress. In 2010, the Democrats lost six seats in the Senate and suffered a 63-seat loss in the House when that chamber flipped to the GOP. And in 2014, the Democrats lost nine Senate seats and control of that body, along with 13 more House seats, leaving their party in its worst shape since 1929. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look back further, though, and you find plenty of examples in which presidents endured only a political flesh wound, if that. In 1962, the Democrats lost only four House seats and picked up two Senate seats. In 1970, the Republicans lost only 12 House seats and gained two Senate seats. In 1990, George H.W. Bush saw his party lose only eight House seats and one Senate seat. And under Bill Clinton in 1998 and George W. Bush in 2002, the party in power &lt;i&gt;gained&lt;/i&gt; seats in the House. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a landslide loss does occur, the reasons vary widely. For example, in 1938, in the middle of FDR\u2019s second term, the Democrats lost 71 House seats and six Senate seats. A severe recession in 1937, along with Roosevelt\u2019s attempts to defeat conservative Democrats and to \u201cpack\u201d the Supreme Court, were factors. But the election of 1938 happened after four consecutive Democratic triumphs that left the party with 73 seats in the Senate and a House margin of 334 to 88. Some of those Democratic losses, then, were a political \u201creversion to the mean,\u201d where a measure of equilibrium was restored. The waves roll in, and then they roll out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same tidal factor can help explain the 1966 midterms, when Democrats lost 47 House and four Senate seats. Yes, dissatisfaction with the Vietnam quagmire, and with racial and generational upheaval, was significant. But so was the fact that the 1964 LBJ landslide had brought Democrats into the House from normally Republican districts. Going into those 1966 elections, the lower chamber was dominated by Democrats, 295 to 140. Likewise, when the Republicans lost nine Senate seats in 1986\u2014and with it, control of the body\u2014several of the defeated incumbents had been pulled into office six years earlier in the wake of Ronald Reagan\u2019s 44-state victory over Jimmy Carter, and could not survive absent that pull. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other landslides require still other explanations: In 1974, the Republicans, already in the congressional minority, lost a staggering 48 House seats along with five Senate seats\u2014in part because voters wanted to give a post-resignation boot to Richard Nixon. The historic 63-seat House loss suffered by Democrats in 2010 happened when the effects of the Great Recession had only begun to recede; unemployment was at 9 percent, the deficit was $1.3 trillion, and Obama\u2019s ambitious health care plan was under withering assault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the midterms have produced a wide variety of results, with a wide variety of causes, what about the impact of the president\u2019s approval ratings? It will not shock you to learn that high approval ratings for a president tend to benefit his party, while low approval ratings hurt. (This is an insight comparable to the observation that \u201ctelevision is a visual medium.\u201d) But there are a couple of cautionary notes to keep in mind when looking toward this November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the correlation is not exact. Similar approval ratings have produced sharply different results. Carter had a 49 percent approval rating in 1978, and Democrats lost 15 House seats; Clinton had a 46 percent rating in 1994, and Democrats lost 52 House seats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And sometimes, positive numbers don\u2019t help a president\u2019s party. Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s 58 percent level did not save Republicans from disaster in 1958, when they lost 48 House and 23 Senate seats. Gerald Ford was given a thumbs-up by 54 percent of the public as late as mid-October 1974, but Republicans still lost 48 House seats the next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most significant for today\u2019s political terrain, when a president is in negative territory, there are usually overarching reasons: a faltering economy, or a war gone bad. President Donald Trump, however, has managed to produce historically low approval ratings in the face of a booming economy and (more or less) international peace. There are signs that Trump\u2019s ratings may be improving\u2014Morning Consult reports &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/14/trump-polling-democrats-republicans-407315\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;a measurable bump&lt;/a&gt;\u2014but if the president remains underwater through this year, we may see a midterm election unlike any in memory, when the White House party has to contend with a president who is unpopular essentially because of his own conduct and character, rather than the broader state of the union. (The post-Watergate election of 1974 may provide a similar example, but that year there was also the hangover from a recession that created headwinds for the Republican campaign.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, no look back at the state of the midterms can ignore a singularly significant result that went largely unheeded on election night. In 2010, we were focused on the disaster that hit Democrats at the congressional level. (A reminder: sixty-three House seats gone, and with them, the loss of the chamber; six Senate seats lost, and with them, the filibuster-proof majority.) Yet it was what was happening at the &lt;i&gt;state&lt;/i&gt; level that had the most serious consequences. Across the nation, statehouses were falling to the Republican Party, from Maine to Pennsylvania to Ohio to Michigan to Wisconsin to Tennessee to New Mexico. Democrats lost some 650 legislative seats, putting Republicans in near total control over the political machinery of the states. (That pattern continued into the 2014 midterms.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;That &lt;/i&gt;was the result that enabled Republicans to consolidate their power, both in raw political and in policy terms. Those statehouse victories enabled Republicans to redraw district lines, magnifying their strength in legislatures and congressional delegations; to restrict access to the ballot box; to cripple the fundraising and collective bargaining power of labor unions, turning one-time bastions of labor like Michigan and Wisconsin into right-to-work states; to cut back on abortion rights; and to expand gun rights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This all happened in good measure because Republicans spent years channeling money and resources into battles at the state level, culminating in 2010\u2019s &lt;a href=\"http://www.redistrictingmajorityproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Project REDMAP&lt;/a&gt;. They recognized that a relatively modest investment of money and energy at the state level could produce &lt;a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2016/06/13/this_is_how_the_gop_rigged_congress_the_secret_plan_that_handcuffed_obamas_presidency_but_backfired_in_donald_trump/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;hugely consequential political results&lt;/a&gt;. Belatedly, Democrats have come to understand that without the recapture of state legislatures and statehouses this fall, their political and policy defeats will only continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to conclude from this survey? By the time Nov. 6, 2018, is over, the Democrats will likely gain House seats, though the Senate is far tougher. But that tells us very little. Trump\u2019s victory did not produce anything like a Republican congressional wave in 2016. His party lost six House seats and two Senate seats\u2014so there are few if any Republican incumbents who will suffer from a lack of Trump coattails. A gain of only a dozen or so seats by Democrats would amount to a huge Republican victory, because it would keep the House under GOP control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, Trump\u2019s approval ratings provide a clue about Republican prospects in the midterms, but the correlation between his numbers and November\u2019s elections is highly inexact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally, while the focus will be on what happens in Washington\u2014Would a Democratic House pursue impeachment? Could a Democratic Senate block Trump\u2019s judges?\u2014pay careful attention to the results from Harrisburg, Columbus, Lansing and Madison. That\u2019s where the most significant impact of November\u2019s votes will be felt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 14:10:48 GMT</pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>Jeff Greenfield</dc:creator>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/15/midterm-election-democrats-trump-216978</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Why Vietnam Isn\u2019t Talking About 1968</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/15/vietnam-war-government-accounts-1968-216973</link>\n      <description>Fifty years after a turning point in the Vietnam War, the country\u2019s communist government is stamping out public discussion of painful memories.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;HANOI, Vietnam \u2014 Ngoc Dai, a 23-year-old  soldier in the People\u2019s Army of Vietnam, was fighting the Americans near the besieged Khe Sanh combat base when his unit received elating orders. They were to emerge from the jungle, \u201cliberate\u201d the old imperial capital of Hue in central Vietnam&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;and stir up a nationwide popular uprising. It was January 30, 1968, three years after President Lyndon B. Johnson had ordered 125,000 American troops to Vietnam to ward off a communist takeover of the south, and the rest of Southeast Asia. Dai and his comrades saw things differently: With nationalistic pride, they were on a mission to reunify Vietnam, launching the surprise assault on South Vietnamese and American troops now known as the Tet Offensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe revenge deep inside the northern soldiers was so big,\u201d Dai, 73, said in an interview at his Hanoi home in January. \u201cAll the soldiers believed we could liberate all the country.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nguyen Qui Duc, only 9 years old at the time, has a very different memory of early 1968. Duc was visiting family for the Lunar New Year, known as Tet, Vietnam\u2019s most important holiday. His father was a regional governor attempting to maintain a semblance of normalcy in South Vietnam as the war raged. A ceasefire was in place for Tet, with much of the South Vietnamese military on leave. It was meant to be a joyous week providing a reprieve from the war. But while sleeping in his grandfather\u2019s house, Duc was awakened around 1 a.m. by gunshots. The soldiers assigned to protect the family had vanished, with men speaking in the distinctive northern Vietnamese accent closing in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cMy mom went to the door and said, \u2018I have two kids in here,\u2019 and the soldiers said, \u2018We\u2019ll shoot anybody we find if you don\u2019t tell us about everyone here,\u2019\u201d Duc recently recalled at the bar and restaurant he now owns in Hanoi. He saw his father taken away and presumed him killed, while the rest of the family huddled in a basement for several days until they were rescued by U.S. and South Vietnamese forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the occasion of its 50th anniversary, the battles of the Tet Offensive, in Hue and elsewhere, have been discussed and dissected in &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/vietnam-67\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;news outlets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Were-Taking-Fire-Reporters-Vietnam/dp/0999035916\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?439942-1/vietnam-wars-tet-offensive-50th-anniversary\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;symposiums&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/remembering-1968-the-tet-offensive-photographer-john-olson/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;TV segments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.newseum.org/2017/12/06/newseum-to-open-photo-exhibit-exploring-the-tet-offensive/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;exhibits&lt;/a&gt; across America, where the attacks are remembered as the moment that turned U.S. public opinion against the war. But in Vietnam, the anniversary of this moment in history, leading up to the Tet holiday on February 16, is being observed very differently\u2014if at all. In fact, Dai\u2019s and Duc\u2019s willingness to share their memories is a rarity in a country where the event is seldom discussed publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Hanoi\u2019s gradual market reforms and increasing friendliness with the United States, old divisions between north and south remain highly sensitive in Vietnam. For the millions of  South Vietnamese who found themselves on the war\u2019s losing side, along with the handful of northerners who have come to regret communist rule, the anniversary is a painful reminder of a violent past. Those who lived through the Tet Offensive also tend to fear speaking out in a country where vaguely worded laws prohibit \u201cpropagating\u201d against the state, a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Accounts of a series of communist purges in the city of Hue\u2014among the bloodiest battles in the war\u2014have been all but stamped out by the regime, which considers the subject of Vietnamese killing their own among the most sensitive of all topics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the 50th anniversary of start of the Tet Offensive arrived in Vietnam, there were few signs of any widespread commemoration. Hanoi\u2019s communist party propaganda posters\u2014an omnipresent feature of streetscapes here\u2014instead celebrated the 88th anniversary on February 3 of the founding of the party. The main commemoration of 1968 took the form of a lavish banquet for senior party officials in Ho Chi Minh City, complete with acrobatic performances and traditional dance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among Vietnamese citizens, memories of the Tet Offensive are brought up publicly only in vague terms that portray the party in a celebratory light, says Nguyen Quang A, 72, a retired businessman and former communist party member turned dissident activist in Hanoi. \u201cI think they want to bury all the old memories, because that undermines their legitimacy,\u201d Quang A says of the communist party in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duc, whose father, the civil servant, was sent to a prison camp for 12 years without trial, says the lack of wider recognition of old suffering is personally painful. \u201cIt hurts. You walk around and see a lot of people, particularly the young people, who don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most accounts of the Hue battle and purges\u2014disproportionately American accounts\u2014are shared safely out of reach from Vietnam\u2019s well-oiled police state. But in recent weeks, I tracked down a handful of aging witnesses of what happened in Hue who agreed to speak frankly on record. With one exception, they have never before spoken out about their memories of the  bloodshed in 1968. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle at Hue, which raged from January 30&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;until early March, was at the heart of the Tet Offensive. While other attacked cities were cleared of communist forces within a few days, Hue was seized almost entirely, leaving only small pockets of U.S. Marines and South Vietnamese soldiers to ultimately ward off the communists in a vicious monthlong battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the battle for Hue, 216 American troops, mostly Marines, were killed as they fought house to house. The communists fought hard, \u201cgrabbing them by the belt buckle,\u201d as they described their strategy\u2014that is, staying as close to the American lines as possible to prevent artillery strikes. The North Vietnamese army listed 2,400 killed, while South Vietnam recorded 452 soldiers&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;dead. Although the communist forces were eventually forced to abandon Hue, their ability to hold on to the city for as long as they did undermined the Johnson administration\u2019s claims that an American victory was in sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duc recalls that while many in Hue were unhappy with the American presence in Vietnam, the residents largely welcomed the American intervention in the battle, which drove off the communists from the city until their ultimate return in 1975. \u201cThe Americans were the saviors in that particular case, saving the city and saving others,\u201d he says, adding that Hue was a center of scholarship and debate that tended to shun both foreign interventionism and communist totalitarianism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claims of mass civilian killings by the communists in Hue have been shoved under the rug in Vietnam. The Vietnamese government only vaguely admits to \u201cmistakes\u201d committed during the battle and fiercely refuses to characterize the events as \u201cmassacres,\u201d as is common outside Vietnam. The first reports of such killings originated from U.S. government studies conducted in the immediate aftermath of the battle. Mass graves were discovered  around the city\u2014many for victims of the crossfire and bombings that flattened  Hue, while other people were found bound and executed, in some cases evidently buried alive. The official South Vietnamese estimate for extrajudicial killings carried  out by the communists was 4,856, while Douglas Pike, a U.S. foreign service officer who documented the battles, estimated 2,800.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Bowden, author of the 2017 book &lt;i&gt;Hue 1968: A Turning Point of the American War in Vietnam&lt;/i&gt;, the most authoritative history of the battle, says he estimates about 2,000 killings took place in pre-planned \u201cpurges\u201d of citizens working for the southern regime, though he believes the true number will never be known. \u201cCertainly, everyone I interviewed, people who fought for the Viet Cong or North Vietnamese army or civilians\u2014no one denied it had happened. The only dispute seems to be over how many,\u201d Bowden says&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a country marred with a 2,000-year history of bloody wars against foreign invaders, the fratricidal nature of the killings made the communists \u201cmuch more cruel than ISIS,\u201d says Truong Van Quy, a 74-year-old Hue resident who makes his living teaching guitar. Quy was a young journalist for South Vietnamese state media during the Tet Offensive; when news of the attack reached him in Saigon, where he was based, he headed home to Hue to see the carnage firsthand. While his family, who worked for the Americans, had safely fled, many of his neighbors were less lucky. \u201cI saw people digging up the mass graves, people buried alive,\u201d Quy recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The North Vietnamese soldier Dai, who is now a composer and among the relatively few Vietnamese citizens who openly calls for an end to single-party rule, remembers seeing people being taken away in vehicles. They were affiliated with the South Vietnamese government, he was told by his superiors, while the men taking them away were part of a \u201csecret unit.\u201d Dai did not personally witness the prisoners\u2019 fates, but he says his friends received chilling orders: \u201cThey took them to the cars and they said these men needed to go to re-education. \u2026 I heard some stories from other soldiers that they had a mission to dig a mass grave.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duc, who emigrated to California in 1975 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen before returning to Vietnam in 2006, tries to avoid visiting Hue these days. Invoking the terminology of Vietnamese culture, which is steeped in belief in the supernatural, he says that \u201cghosts\u201d haunt the city. \u201cYou come to a particular corner of the street, and you remember that there was a grave there in 1968,\u201d he says. (He recently wrote about family\u2019s experience in an &lt;a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/revisiting-vietnam-50-years-after-tet-offensive-180967501/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;i&gt;Smithsonian&lt;/i&gt; magazine.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tran Viet Man, the 54-year-old abbot of Hue\u2019s Vien Quang Buddhist pagoda, says memories of Hue live on if not in public then in the private ancestral worship that permeates Vietnamese society\u2014family members of the perished honor their ancestors quietly in their homes, for instance. Man says the people of Hue have achieved &lt;i&gt;hoa binh&lt;/i&gt;\u2014the Vietnamese word for the absence of war. They have not, however, reached &lt;i&gt;thai binh&lt;/i&gt;, or harmony. \u201cThe war is finished, but the peace has not arrived completely,\u201d he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nguyen Quang A, the communist turned dissident, contrasts the Vietnamese government\u2019s unwillingness to acknowledge the past with the long reconciliation following the American Civil War. Such healing, he points out, takes time even in democratic societies\u2014\u201cstill there are problems\u201d between the northern and southern United States, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attempts at reconciliation are virtually nonexistent in Vietnam. Half a century after the Tet Offensive, the communist party still maintains that there was no civil war. To express any other viewpoint is to be labeled a \u201creactionary\u201d by the state and society, which can yield consequences ranging from unemployment to lengthy prison sentences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe rhetoric of the war was that the party led the war against the Americans, that there was no other  Vietnamese side that didn\u2019t believe in communism,\u201d Duc explains. \u201cTo say there was no civil war is to ignore the millions of Vietnamese that died fighting each other, and that hurts and angers me.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:20:56 GMT</pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>Bennett Murray</dc:creator>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/15/vietnam-war-government-accounts-1968-216973</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>The Clock Is Not Ticking on DACA</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/14/daca-deal-democrats-clock-not-ticking-216976</link>\n      <description>The longer Democrats wait to cut a deal, the more leverage they will have.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;All of a sudden this week, Republicans are awfully impatient to get an immigration deal done. \u201cThis will be our last chance, there will never be another opportunity! March 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;,\u201d tweeted President &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/963365328716812288\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Donald Trump, &lt;/a&gt;referring to the day his executive order set the termination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. \u201cThe clock is ticking\u201d warned Senate Majority Leader &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenateMajLdr/status/963463848765386752\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Mitch McConnell&lt;/a&gt; on the Senate floor. \u201cIt\u2019s this week or not at all,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/12/politics/immigration-debate-advances-one-week/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;John Cornyn&lt;/a&gt;, \u201cWe need to get it wrapped up by Thursday.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all: What a callous sentiment to express regarding the lives of hundreds of thousands of people who have been left in limbo for &lt;i&gt;years&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the seemingly coordinated statements are designed to put Democrats in a vise. The Republican demand is: Either accept a deal to save DACA on our terms, and give those 1.8 million undocumented immigrants eligible for the program a path to citizenship, or get nothing except blame for hanging the \u201cDREAMers\u201d out to dry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Democrats need not be suckers. They should see the Republican pressure tactics for what they are: an attempt to rush a deal that would lock in a slew of restrictions on future immigration while Democrats have the weakest amount of leverage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is only one way for Democrats to gain more leverage: Walk. Away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats are in this pickle because, if I may be so humble, they didn\u2019t take my &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/01/16/government-shutdown-democrats-216331\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;January advice&lt;/a&gt; to forgo a shutdown. While shutdowns are often advocated in the belief that taking the entire federal government hostage increases negotiating leverage, every time it happens the opposite proves true. The focus shifts from the issue at hand to the parks being closed and the soldiers going without pay. The instigators suffer public scorn for playing politics with people\u2019s lives. They invariably cave, winning nothing for their troubles and turning political capital into ash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before the shutdown ended, Democrats were already coughing up concessions. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer offered Trump money for his signature border wall in exchange for DACA. Rep. Luis Guti&amp;eacute;rrez, a stout defender of DREAMers who often criticizes Democratic leadership for not prioritizing immigration, &lt;a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/house/369945-gutierrez-ready-to-give-in-on-wall\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;completely capitulated&lt;/a&gt; on the wall, saying that for DACA, \u201cI\u2019ll take a bucket, take bricks, and start building it myself. And he more broadly conceded, \u201cWe will dirty our hands in order for the Dreamers to have a clean future in America.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the shutdown ended, Trump called that bluff with his offer, piling on measures to stop the ability for citizens and green card holders to sponsor family members beyond spouses and minor offspring, and terminate the &lt;a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/diversity-visa-program/544646/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;visa lottery program&lt;/a&gt;, which grants 50,000 visas a year to promote geographic diversity. Those proposals would restrict future &lt;i&gt;legal&lt;/i&gt; immigration by &lt;a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/experience/food-and-wine/news-festivals-events/2018/01/25/trump-team-unveils-new-immigration-framework-path-citizenship-dreamers/1066980001/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;25 percent&lt;/a&gt; (the pro-immigration libertarian CATO Institute estimates the cut to be &lt;a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/white-house-plan-bans-22-million-legal-immigrants-over-5-decades\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;44 percent&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats and activists quickly moved their goal posts. Schumer publicly rescinded the wall offer and one immigrant advocate dubbed Trump\u2019s proposal a &lt;a href=\"https://unitedwedream.org/2018/01/immigrant-youth-trumps-white-supremacist-proposal-no/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;\u201cwhite supremacist ransom note.\u201d&lt;/a&gt; But Democrats have already showed their cards, and are clearly still feeling the pressure. Just this week, independent-but-in-the-Democratic leadership &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2018/02/14/daily-202-a-pragmatic-bernie-sanders-seeks-an-immigration-compromise-to-protect-dreamers/5a83ac8630fb041c3c7d7868/?utm_term=.dac97166a22e\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Sen. Bernie Sanders told the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, \u201cI would go much further than I think is right. Unwillingly. Unhappily. I think it\u2019s a stupid thing to do. But we have to protect the DREAMers. \u2026 I\u2019m willing to make some painful concessions.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the shutdown has done for Democrats to date is signal to Republicans: We will do almost anything to save the DREAMers. While that is a noble impulse, it is based on a faulty premise: that the DREAMers are in imminent danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no March 5 deadline as of today. In January, a federal district judge slapped an injunction on Trump\u2019s executive order while legal challenges to it proceed. While Trump\u2019s Justice Department is appealing the decision, it did not ask for an immediate stay. A second federal district judge this week echoed that decision. At this moment, DACA lives and is accepting applications for two-year permit renewals, though it is not taking new applicants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How long will that injunction remain in place? That\u2019s not clear yet, but it\u2019s very possible it will remain for months, even years. &lt;a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/legal-us-otc-daca/doj-makes-last-pitch-for-immediate-scotus-review-of-daca-idUSKBN1FT08B\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;This week the Supreme Court will decide&lt;/a&gt; whether it will take the case, and skip over the federal appellate court stage of the process, as the Justice Department has requested. That would be an unusual move for the Supreme Court to make, and since Justice did not ask for an emergency stay of the injunction, some &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/01/22/government-shutdown-daca-donald-trump-216496\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;court watchers&lt;/a&gt; believe the urgency does not exist for the Supreme Court to expedite the case. Even if the high court does take the case, it doesn\u2019t have to consider it immediately. It could decide this term, which ends in June, or put it on the next term\u2019s calendar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as DACA is in place, there\u2019s no pressure on Democrats to deal. And if Democrats have weak leverage today, they have every reason to play for more time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is also possible that the Supreme Court could lift the injunction. So could an appellate court if the Supreme Court passes on taking the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if the injunction is scrapped, that\u2019s the moment when Democrats can regain their lost leverage. Because if you clear away the bluster, all indications are that Trump and the Republicans are terrified, absolutely terrified, of having their fingerprints on the deportation of hundreds of thousands of sympathetic young people who grew up in this country and see themselves as Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cornyn, who this week heatedly delivered the Thursday ultimatum, was much more Zen &lt;a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-congress/dreamer-immigration-bill-not-on-u-s-senate-agenda-this-month-idUSKBN1EC2QN\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;back in December&lt;/a&gt;, when he said if Congress couldn\u2019t pass a bill by March 5, \u201cthen the president could extend the deadline if he chose to do so.\u201d (In fact, Cornyn had a different message one hour before his ultimatum, when he said, \u201cWe could do it this week if there is cooperation. If there is not, it might take longer.\u201d) If Trump did not push back the deadline, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly has &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/06/john-kelly-deportation-not-priority-for-dreamers.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;insisted&lt;/a&gt; DREAMers would not be priorities for deportation, though they would lack work permits and would still be vulnerable to deportation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the only group of people Trump says nicer things about than DREAMers are coal miners, expressing his \u201clove\u201d for them and &lt;a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-says-he-has-love-dreamers-urges-congress-daca-action-n798881\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;admitting&lt;/a&gt;, \u201cReally we have no choice. We have to be able to do something.\u201d Last month, &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/24/politics/trump-citizenship/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Trump said&lt;/a&gt; to those anxious about their status, \u201cTell them not to worry about it. We're going to solve the problem.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, Trump created the problem with his own executive order back in September. But the fact that he gave Congress six months for a legislative solution, and didn\u2019t try to stay the injunction that restored DACA for the time being, suggests Trump wants to have it both ways: Pander to his anti-immigrant base with a hardline policy without suffering the political backlash from following through. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the risk of the mass deportation of DREAMers really becomes real, the political equation changes. Instead of Democrats panicking that without concessions, they can\u2019t save the DREAMers, Republicans will be panicking they\u2019ll be on the hook for any cruel deportations. Sure, Republicans will try to blame Democrats for legislative intransigence, but Democrats don\u2019t run the Department of Homeland Security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What should Democrats say to justify walking away from the table?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We support the DREAMers. We support border security. But we can\u2019t support a plan that slams the door shut on immigrants who want to come legally to be with their families and contribute to America\u2019s greatness. Donald Trump promised a &lt;a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/news/a44427/donald-trump-big-beautiful-door-meme/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;\u201cbig beautiful door\u201d&lt;/a&gt; for legal immigrants when he campaigned for president, and we intend to hold him to that.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Furthermore, why are Republicans suddenly so interested in rushing through a giant comprehensive bill? Back in 2013, after the Senate took months to pass bipartisan reform legislation, House Republicans killed it. The Speaker at the time said we shouldn\u2019t have a \u201csingle, massive \u2026 bill,\u201d but rather &lt;a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/07/10/200860744/house-gop-we-wont-consider-senate-immigration-bill\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;\u201ca step-by-step, common-sense approach to actually fix the problem.\u201d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why not start with the one step we all agree on? Give the DREAMers a path to citizenship. There is no reason we can\u2019t do that and save the debates around family unification and the visa lottery for later.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If Republicans aren\u2019t prepared to do that today, we can wait for the courts. As of today, DACA is alive and eligible DREAMers should apply to renew their permits. If the legal picture changes, we will happily come back to the table to find a legislative solution. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s terrible that DREAMers have been turned into political pawns, but that\u2019s on Trump. Democrats have to think about not only those currently in America, but also those in the future for whom America could be their lifeline. Immigration reform laws tend to last a long time, as it is a perpetually divisive subject that legislators are loath to touch. To hastily and unnecessarily let Trump end a 50-year era when America welcomed immigrants would be a calamity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is: The clock is not ticking. We don\u2019t have to wrap by Thursday. There will be another opportunity. Republicans are creating an artificial sense of urgency to escape a mess of their own making. Democrats should not repeat their own mistake of the shutdown and rush into a bad deal. Now is the time to wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2018 18:20:52 GMT</pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>(Bill Scher)</dc:creator>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/14/daca-deal-democrats-clock-not-ticking-216976</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Inside the Senate's ugly immigration breakdown</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/senate-immigration-daca-dreamers-breakdown-415629</link>\n      <description>The failure of a months-long effort to help Dreamers is the latest display of legislative ineptitude.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Senate was ever going to pass a bill to protect hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation, it needed James Lankford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A conservative senator from Oklahoma with a youthful visage, Lankford had been working since September to help so-called Dreamers. The 49-year-old Lankford dutifully attended bipartisan meetings, cobbling together ideas and trying to enlist support for a bipartisan deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when the group showed him the latest draft of their plan Tuesday night, Lankford was stunned. It was far from what he had expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI looked through the outlines of the proposal and realized: \u2019This is nothing close to what we\u2019ve talked about,\u2019\u201d Lankford said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Lankford voted against the last-gasp proposal from Sens. Angus King (I-Maine) and Mike Rounds (R-S.D.). So did North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, another critical Republican vote on immigration. And they were joined by a trio of GOP senators who backed the comprehensive immigration bill that passed the Senate in 2013 and were seen as gettable this time: Bob Corker of Tennessee, Dean Heller of Nevada and Orrin Hatch of Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate\u2019s spectacular failure to address the plight of the most sympathetic batch of immigrants in the country illegally \u2014 a group that President Donald Trump once declared he had \u201cgreat love\u201d for \u2014 was the latest display of legislative ineptitude in the upper chamber. This account, detailing the demise of the months-long immigration push, is based on interviews with more than a dozen senators and aides who\u2019ve worked on the issue since Trump announced last fall he was rescinding the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While senators vowed to try again, there\u2019s no apparent reason to think the next time will be any different. Immigration has always been polarizing and difficult to tackle, but Trump\u2019s ascendance has made it that much more so, diminishing trust and depleting the group of deal-making senators it would take to clear the chamber\u2019s 60-vote threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m real worried about that. I\u2019m worried about the politics on both the far right and far left. And how do we find the center?\u201d said Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), a member of the centrist coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debate over the fate of Dreamers shifted last August, when Trump endorsed a proposal that would make steep cuts to legal immigration proposed by hard-line Sens. David Perdue (R-Ga.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). Trump then moved to rescind the DACA program the next month, putting the program in the lap of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As winter settled over Washington, Trump implored senators in mid-January to cut a deal \u2014 even if it contained \u201cthings I'm not in love with.\u201d But as senators got to work on a simple agreement to protect Dreamers and boost border security, Trump made new demands. His &amp;quot;four pillars&amp;quot; \u2014 including politically toxic reforms to the diversity lottery and family migration that Democrats could never get behind \u2014 became the GOP benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Come Thursday\u2019s vote, even though Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Majority Whip  John Cornyn of Texas gently coaxed undecided Republicans to oppose the bipartisan plan, most of the finger-pointing for the failure was directed at the White House. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe administration made it difficult for some [Republicans] to try to publicly support anything,\u201d one Republican senator said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn\u2019t until the final hours that people in both parties knew the effort was doomed. Even after Lankford bailed, senators and aides working on the bill said they were bullish that they could get fence-sitting Republicans to come their way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Trump administration had other ideas. A statement issued by the Department of Homeland Security in the wee hours of Thursday morning doused any hope of securing 60 votes. It charged that the King-Rounds bill would turn the United States into \u201ca sanctuary nation where ignoring the rule of law is encouraged.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe DHS release was like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen from a government agency. It was more like from a political campaign. And it wasn\u2019t very accurate. And that\u2019s putting it mildly,\u201d King said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only eight Republicans voted for King\u2019s proposal; 36 GOP senators backed the president\u2019s stricter, hard-line plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it wasn\u2019t just Republicans who were divided. Democrats were going through their own internal strife leading up to the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Party leaders had been bullish that if they could get 11 Republicans on board, the entire 49-member Democratic Caucus would band together to put it over the top. Once it was clear the Republican votes wouldn\u2019t materialize, though, party leaders braced for a mass defection of their liberal members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, only three Democrats voted no, including New Mexico Sens. Martin Heinrich and Tom Udall, and California Sen. Kamala Harris. Yet that small number did not reflect the hard feelings within the conference. Weeks earlier, Democratic leaders had relented in a fight over the budget after McConnell promised a vote on immigration \u2014 and this was hardly the result rank-and-file members envisioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked whether he was pleased with how caucus leaders handled the debate, Heinrich replied: \u201cI\u2019m not going to Monday-morning quarterback anybody\u2019s efforts. Everybody was trying to get something done here.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris\u2019 \u201cno\u201d vote caused the most apparent drama on the Democratic side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As senators announced their vote on the bipartisan plan, the potential 2020 presidential candidate and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) spoke tensely on the Senate floor. Harris then departed to the Democratic cloakroom. A few minutes later, she emerged and announced her \u201cno\u201d vote to audible gasps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Democrats were furious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf Sen. Harris tries to use this 'no' vote to get to the left of her colleagues in Iowa ... she\u2019ll be rightly and roundly pummeled for it. Some Democrats fought for Dreamers today, others fought for themselves,\u201d said a Democratic staffer whose boss was fighting for the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lily Adams, a spokeswoman for Harris, responded: \u201cSen. Harris voted her conscience on an issue she\u2019s worked on for years, and that impacts California more than any other state in the country. Dreamers have been and remain her No. 1 priority.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the prospect of failure came into focus in recent days, some senators involved in the bipartisan talks began mulling an emergency backup measure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was \u201csomewhat jokingly referred to as the \u2018break the glass\u2019 option,\u201d one senator closely involved in the bipartisan talks said in an interview. \u201cWhich is, 'What the hell do we do if we get to Thursday night and nothing gets 60?'\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fallback, floated by Sens. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), would have extended DACA protections for three more years in exchange for three years of border funding. But it never gained serious traction: Many senators simply didn\u2019t want to discuss the possibility of failure on a permanent fix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe response was: \u2018Let\u2019s try harder.\u2019 So maybe I was too willing to give up,\u201d Heitkamp said with a hint of sarcasm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Privately, Democrats said it was Republicans such as Tillis and Lankford who were too willing to give up. They said  those senators never seemed particularly interested in how far Democrats were moving toward Trump and his border wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endorsing $25 billion in wall funding was a real concession, they believed, considering how much their base hated the idea. They didn\u2019t see the same give in the GOP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt cannot be overstated. They have not moved one inch,\u201d a Democratic aide said of Tillis and Lankford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lankford said he worked his \u201ctail off\u201d before dropping off this week. And Tillis attended meetings but began to distance himself from the talks in January after Trump and lawmakers met at the White House, where the president said he\u2019d back whatever deal they sent him. Despite the president's encouraging words, Tillis came away from the meeting believing that Democrats wouldn't support a plan that Trump would actually sign. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThey\u2019re going down a path that won\u2019t produce an outcome,\u201d Tillis recalled thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distrust didn't stop there. Two days after the White House meeting, the president backtracked. Trump rejected the first bipartisan plan, written by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;And on Thursday, Graham found himself under attack from Homeland Security and White House officials who anonymously bashed him in a phone call with reporters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\u201cSo, as long as Steve Miller is running the White House and Tom Tancredo is in charge of DHS, we\u2019re going nowhere fast,\u201d Graham said. Miller is a senior White House aide and immigration hard-liner. And a former aide to Tancredo \u2014 the onetime Colorado representative who is similarly conservative on immigration \u2014 works as a press aide at DHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou\u2019ve got the two most extreme characters in the town running the show. What do you expect?\u201d Graham added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final nail for some Republicans was seeing Schumer\u2019s name unexpectedly placed on the bipartisan proposal as one of its co-sponsors. Maine's Sen. Susan Collins  complained to Senate floor staff about it ahead of Thursday\u2019s vote. Though Schumer\u2019s office said he had no hand in writing the bill, it nonetheless gave the White House and its allies all the ammunition they needed to thrash the \u201cSchumer-Rounds-King\u201d proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now, Democrats are on record as supporting things much of the base despises \u2014 the wall, immigration restrictions on DACA recipients\u2019 parents and a path to citizenship for significantly fewer undocumented immigrants than the 11 million who would have been helped by the 2013 legislation \u2014 with nothing to show for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the chief GOP sponsor of the compromise found an upside in what seemed like a wasted exercise: Republicans now have a much better sense of how far the minority will bend on immigration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat,\u201d said Rounds, \u201cis a big step.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ted Hesson contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 10:00:09 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>eschor@politico.com (Elana Schor)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/senate-immigration-daca-dreamers-breakdown-415629</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Flake plans new push on Dreamers</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/dreamers-daca-jeff-flake-immigration-senate-415856</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite the collapse of this week\u2019s immigration debate, Jeff Flake isn\u2019t giving up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retiring Arizona Republican said he plans to go to the Senate floor as soon as the chamber returns from next week\u2019s recess and will demand a vote on his plan to provide $7.6 billion in border wall money spread over three years in exchange for three years of codification of the expiring Deferred Actions for Childhood Arrivals program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019ll just keep at it. I do think that\u2019s something the Democrats can go for,\u201d Flake said in a telephone interview Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flake expects co-sponsors in both parties for his effort; Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) has also spoken favorably of going to a small-ball deal if more comprehensive efforts failed. She said Thursday that she consistently raised the possible backup plan during bipartisan talks that failed to produce a bill that could win 60 votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cOne of the things I repeatedly said is that: \u2018The fallback position might have been better structured as three and three.\u2019 Three years of [border wall] funding for three years of codification of DACA,\u201d Heitkamp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration may have other plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House\u2019s early preference going forward is a new bill sponsored by GOP Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Rob Portman of Ohio that would provide $25 billion in exchange for permanently extending DACA, an administration official said on Friday. Enrollees would have to reapply every two years under that plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Flake and Thune proposals were introduced after the Senate on Thursday rejected several efforts to protect Dreamers ahead of a March 5 deadline imposed by President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump\u2019s plan to grant a pathway to citizenship to 1.8 million young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $25 billion in border wall money and cuts to legal immigration failed spectacularly, garnering only 39 votes. A bipartisan bill that Flake and Heitkamp helped write that sidestepped those cuts to legal immigration also failed to get 60 votes, falling short at 54.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flake said support for the centrists\u2019 effort may have been tamped down by the order of the votes on Thursday. The bipartisan amendment came before the Trump-backed bill from Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). And Flake suspects many in his party were holding out to vote with Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe had hopes that we might get to 60. It was difficult given the way it was structured. Having the Grassley proposal last made it difficult,\u201d Flake said. \u201cYou had a number of Republicans that felt they needed to vote yes on the president\u2019s proposal.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 22:16:44 GMT</pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>Burgess Everett</dc:creator>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/dreamers-daca-jeff-flake-immigration-senate-415856</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Gillibrand accepts nomination for another term, promises to serve all of it</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2018/02/16/gillibrand-accepts-nomination-for-another-term-promises-to-serve-all-of-it-261836</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;ALBANY \u2014 The New York State Democratic Committee formally renominated Sen. &lt;a href=\"https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51503\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Kirsten Gillibrand&lt;/a&gt; for her second full term, and cheered as she promised to be an ongoing voice in Democratic struggles against President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019ve also been very humbled by helping to start this national conversation about ending sexual violence. Whether it\u2019s sexual assault, sexual violence \u2014 wherever it happens,\u201d Gillibrand said Friday to a meeting of the state committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cDo we value women? We do. Our party does value women. We as New Yorkers, we value women. And that is why we can never give up on these issues, we can never give in on these issues,\u201d she said. \u201cI pledge to you that even with President Trump in our Oval Office, I will never stop fighting to solve these problems. I will never stop fighting to find common ground because that is literally the only path to success.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans will convene March 2 to formally designate a candidate. GOP leaders say it will likely be Chele Chiavacci Farley, a private equity executive from Manhattan. She &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2018/02/01/chele-chiavacci-farley-officially-enters-race-against-gillibrand-230980\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;formally declared&lt;/a&gt; her candidacy earlier this month, accusing Gillibrand of not securing enough federal money for the state and focusing on her own ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if she plans to serve a full term if elected in November, Gillibrand said, &amp;quot;I do.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I really want to serve in the U.S. Senate,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;I\u2019m very grateful for the opportunity to be nominated by my party, and I really want to make a difference for New Yorkers. ... I\u2019m really focused on \u201918, and I think all of us should be because most of the things we need to protect we could protect if we flip the House and flip the Senate. I would like to be part of that and keep serving in the U.S. Senate.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jessica Proud, a spokeswoman for the state GOP, said Gillibrand clearly has her eye on 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The only thing Kirsten Gillibrand cares about being nominated for is president,&amp;quot; Proud said in a statement. &amp;quot;I\u2019m surprised she took a break from her national media tour to return to New York, but voters won\u2019t forget how she\u2019s abandoned them for her personal ambitions and inside-the-Beltway political games.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to sexual harassment issues, Gillibrand touted her work securing health care for first responders to the Sept. 11 attacks, prohibiting insider trading by members of Congress, and &lt;a href=\"https://www.politicopro.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2017/07/31/hoosick-falls-site-added-to-national-superfund-priority-list-113686\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;winning a Superfund designation&lt;/a&gt; for Hoosick Falls, a Rensselaer County village whose water supply was contaminated by a factory that produced nonstick coatings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nominating convention was relatively staid. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the de facto leader of the Democratic State Committee, did not attend the event, as &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2016/02/democrats-nominate-chuck-schumer-for-a-fourth-term-031762\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;he did in 2016&lt;/a&gt; when Sen. &lt;a href=\"https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51231\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Chuck Schumer&lt;/a&gt; was re-nominated for a fourth term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gillibrand threw a dart at Cuomo, another possible 2020 contender, when she told reporters she found &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2018/02/06/howe-and-transparency-questions-take-center-stage-in-percoco-trial-238621\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;revelations emerging from the corruption trial&lt;/a&gt; of Cuomo confidante Joe Percoco to be \u201cdisturbing.\u201d Cuomo has refused to comment on the ongoing trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four women, including Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, spoke in support of Gillibrand, who was born in Albany and worked as a lawyer in New York City and Washington before successfully running in 2006 for a House seat in the New York's capital region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She defeated Rep. John Sweeney (R-Clifton Park) in that election, running in her party\u2019s right lane.

Politicians are struggling to catch up.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Late last year, a St. Louis tech executive named Emre \u015earbak noticed something strange about Google Translate. He was translating phrases from Turkish -- a language that uses a single gender-neutral pronoun \u201co\u201d instead of \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe.\u201d But when he asked Google\u2019s tool to turn the sentences into English, they seemed to read like a children\u2019s book out of the 1950\u2019s. The ungendered Turkish sentence \u201co is a nurse\u201d would become \u201cshe is a nurse,\u201d while \u201co is a doctor\u201d would become \u201che is a doctor.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The website Quartz went on to compose a sort-of poem highlighting some of these phrases; Google\u2019s translation program decided that soldiers, doctors and entrepreneurs were men, while teachers and nurses were women. Overwhelmingly, the professions were male. Finnish and Chinese translations had similar problems of their own, Quartz noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was going on? Google\u2019s Translate tool \u201clearns\u201d language from an existing corpus of writing, and the writing often includes cultural patterns regarding how men and women are described. Because the model is trained on data that already has biases of its own, the results that it spits out serve only to further replicate and even amplify them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might seem strange that a seemingly objective piece of software would yield gender-biased results, but the problem is an increasing concern in the technology world. The term is \u201calgorithmic bias\u201d -- the idea that artificially intelligent software, the stuff we count on to do everything from power our Netflix recommendations to determine our qualifications for a loan, often turns out to perpetuate social bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voice-based assistants, like Amazon\u2019s Alexa, have struggled to recognize different accents. A Microsoft chatbot on Twitter started spewing racist posts after learning from other users on the platform. In a particularly embarrassing example in 2015, a black computer programmer found that Google\u2019s photo-recognition tool labeled him and a friend as \u201cgorillas.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the results of hidden computer bias are insulting, other times merely annoying. And sometimes the effects are potentially life-changing. A ProPublica investigation two years ago found that software used to predict inmates\u2019 likelihood of being a high risk for recidivism was nearly twice as likely to be inaccurate when assessing African-American inmates versus white inmates. Such scores are increasingly being used in sentencing and parole decisions by judges, directly affecting the way the criminal justice system treats individual citizens. Crucial pieces of software can have big societal effects, and their biases can often go unnoticed until the results are already being felt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The industry knows it has a problem; Google took a huge public relations hit after its gorilla-photo scandal. But the issue keeps cropping up, often hidden inside proprietary &amp;quot;black box&amp;quot; software packages, and compounded by the cultural blind spots of a disproportionately white and male tech industry. The problem is now landing squarely in the public-policy realm, and leaders are struggling with how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE UPBEAT WAY&lt;/b&gt; to talk about algorithms in public life is &amp;quot;smart governance&amp;quot; \u2014 the idea that software can give leaders quick answers and better tools to make decisions. Given their ability to crunch a massive amount of information in rapid fashion, algorithms are expected to become more and more important to decision-making at every level. Already, they're being used to determine individuals\u2019 eligibility for welfare, the number of police that should be sent to different neighborhoods and the residents most in need of public health assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they've caught on, the impressive potential of smart governance has become clouded by the uncertainty over just how those &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; systems are sizing up people. The potential for underyling bias in software is not an easy issue for political leaders to tackle, in part because it\u2019s so deeply technical. But regulators have begun taking notice at the federal level. A 2016 report from the Obama-era Office of Science and Technology Policy warned that the impact of artificial-intelligence-driven algorithms on workers has the potential to worsen inequality, and noted that bias buried in computer code could disadvantage individuals in a host of fields. (It's not clear that the current White House shares its concerns: The AI Now Institute, which works with the American Civil Liberties Union and whose founders are also researchers at Microsoft and Google, has warned about the Trump administration\u2019s lack of engagement with AI policy.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all the agreement that bias is an issue, it's far from clear just how to tackle it. One piece of legislation introduced in Congress does mention it; the Future of AI Act, sponsored by a small bipartisan group in the House and Senate, includes a plank titled \u201cSupporting the unbiased development of AI.\u201d The provision, though pioneering, doesn\u2019t offer a solution: It would set up a 19-person federal advisory committee within the Commerce Department to track the growth of such technology and provide recommendations about its impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's uncertain whether this bill would get serious consideration, and if it did, that advisory committee would have its hands full. For one, the problem of hidden software bias is as varied as the number of algorithms out there. Because each algorithm learns from different data sets and features its own unique design, it\u2019s tough to develop a standardized set of requirements that would apply to every distinct model. On top of all that, the software packages that contain the algorithms \u2014 even those used in public policy \u2014 are often proprietary, owned and guarded by the companies that developed them. Government bodies that use AI-driven software don't necessarily have rights to look at the underlying code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of the ProPublica investigation into recidivism bias, for example, the algorithm was inside a piece of software called COMPAS, used by various states to estimate the likelihood and severity of any future crime a released prisoner might commit. The software was developed by Northpointe, a private company that was acquired by the Toronto-based firm Constellation Software in 2011. Sentencing judges weren\u2019t able to see into the internal workings of the model because the code was proprietary. Some states have done statistical analyses to evaluate its accuracy, but the details of how it weighs variables correlated with race remain an open question. (Researchers are continuing to look into it.) Northpointe ultimately did share the loose structure of its algorithm with ProPublica, but declined to share specific calculations, and has since disputed the story\u2019s conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the field, many now say there\u2019s overwhelming acknowledgement about the need to tackle the issue. The conversation has moved from \u201cWhat do you mean there\u2019s a problem?\u201d to \u201cOh no, we need to fix it,\u201d said University of Utah professor Suresh Venkatasubramanian, one of the academics who contributed to the OSTP\u2019s review on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of the efforts aimed at curbing bias are pressing companies to shine a light on the algorithms they create. \u201cMany of the ill effects are not intentional. It comes from people designing technology in closed rooms in close conversations and not thinking of the real world,\u201d Rachel Goodman, a staff attorney for the ACLU\u2019s racial justice program, told Fast Company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, the New York City Council passed a bill to establish a task force dedicated to reviewing algorithms that the city employs for everything from school placement to police distribution. The bill, which is now officially law, sets up a task force that is expected to include representatives from city departments that use algorithms, members of the tech and legal industries, as well as technical ethicists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key focus of this group would be to test how the city's algorithms affect different groups of New Yorkers. For example, the task force could look at whether an algorithm used to determine bail eligibility treats white and black offenders differently. The unit is also expected to figure out how to alert residents when they were affected by a decision made by an algorithm. If a model tells law enforcement to dispatch more police officers to one part of the city, that could prompt government officials to notify residents of that neighborhood about the change. Additionally, the task force would examine how the data used to train these algorithms can be more broadly disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf we're going to be governed by machines and algorithms and data, well, they better be transparent,\u201d NYC Council member James Vacca said during a hearing of the body\u2019s technology committee. \u201cAs we advance into the 21st century, we must ensure our government is not \u2018black boxed.\u2019\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandating the open-sourcing of algorithms is one way lawmakers could put pressure on private firms, said University of San Francisco professor Rachel Thomas, the founder of fast.ai, a nonprofit research lab and coding course that teaches users how to build machine learning systems. Thomas argues that governments can refuse to take bids from black-box software providers, and require all contractors to divulge their source code and explain how their systems work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIdeally, it would be great if the data could be open-source as well,\u201d she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city of Pittsburgh recently put the issue of transparency front and center when implementing a new software program developed by the Allegheny County Department of Human Services to figure out which children were most susceptible to abuse and neglect. Unlike many models bought from software companies, the risk algorithm is owned by Allegheny County itself, so all records about its internal workings are public and available for researcher scrutiny. The government officials implementing the program were highly cognizant of the potential for bias and elected not to use race as a factor in the model. (They do, however, acknowledge that there are variables in the algorithm like \u201ccriminal justice history,\u201d which could be correlated with race.) As of last December, the algorithm has been found to treat black and white families \u201cmore consistently\u201d than human screeners had before, &lt;i&gt;The New York Times &lt;/i&gt;reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich Caruana, a Microsoft researcher who has worked to better understand the internal mechanisms of algorithms, said that omitting variables like gender and race in different algorithms isn\u2019t always the solution to countering bias. In some cases, like medical predictions, these variables could be important to accuracy. And there can be other variables, like ZIP codes, that can correlate with race and introduce bias into models that don\u2019t explicitly include race. which can embody biases as well when they are included in models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Europe, a sweeping new set of privacy regulations slated to take effect this spring strives to take a crack at the issue of transparency as well. One of its provisions would offer users a \u201cright to explanation\u201d when their data is processed by an automated system. But while it sounds straightforward, imposing a broad requirement like this can pose its own challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s not yet clear how this will work,\u201d Caruana said. He worries that as appealing as \u201ctransparency\u201d may sound, there\u2019s no easy way to unpack the algorithm inside AI software in a way that makes sense to people. \u201cThere are cases where the law can go too far \u2026 too soon. Suddenly, everyone in the EU has a legal right to an explanation. Most of the time, we wouldn\u2019t know how to do it,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;EVEN IF IT'S&lt;/b&gt; hard to unpack an algorithm, simply putting a high priority on transparency could have useful effects. Two Oxford researchers published a paper arguing that one of the main benefits of the new European rules would be to force tech companies to consider transparency from the beginning when designing their products. The new rules could pressure firms to develop models that can be more easily outlined for a consumer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And algorithmic transparency may not be the only way regulators could offer greater insight into biased systems. Another way would be scrutinizing the data that an algorithm learns from. If historic data showed that successful candidates for a certain job were mostly men, an algorithm that learned from that data could be more likely to recommend men for job in the future, tilting the playing field. \u201cIf you give anything bad data, it\u2019s going to give you a bad answer,\u201d Venkatasubramanian notes. That\u2019s aparently what was going on with the \u201cgorilla\u201d scandal of 2015: Google said the issue arose because its algorithm hadn\u2019t conducted enough analysis of people with different skin tones, in different lighting. Similarly, Georgetown Law School researchers have found that facial recognition systems used by police are statistically worse at recognizing African-American faces because they\u2019ve been trained on more images of white people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One idea for tackling the data problem\u2014and a place that many experts believe Washington could play a useful role\u2014is new industry-wide standards or benchmarks that algorithms need to meet before they can be used broadly in the wild. These standards could call for systems to be trained on equal amounts of data for users of different racial backgrounds and genders, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have suggested that government bodies also could develop a set of principles that outline priorities for fairness, as a barometer for policymaker use, in addition to industry development of algorithms. Having such standards could push regulators to check on the results their algorithms produce, and force them to evaluate how variables like gender and race, or proxies for them, are weighted in these outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of monitoring is key to spotting and preventing bias, said Sarah Tan, a former Microsoft researcher and current Cornell graduate student, who studies algorithms and fairness. Companies should be required to review their algorithm\u2019s outcomes, a potentially more accessible measure than parsing a complicated formula, she suggests. A federal body like the Federal Trade Commission, which already oversees tech companies and consumer harm, could play a key role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of auditing algorithms on a routine basis is something that\u2019s come up repeatedly among researchers as a potential means for holding companies accountable, not only to track instances of bias, but also to measure the impact of opaque processes like social media models that recommend news stories. Former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has backed the concept of a \u201cpublic-interest API,\u201d which would call on firms like Facebook to provide the details of the outputs of its algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as AI grows in importance, some believe the scope of the problems the industry faces will extend beyond the ability of legacy agencies to keep up. Some prominent voices, including Elon Musk, a founder of research group OpenAI, and former Department of Justice attorney-adviser Andrew Tutt, have proposed going so far as to establish a standalone federal agency that would oversee the development of AI, much like the Federal Communications Commission and Food and Drug Administration do for their respective industries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The scale and uncertainty involved is part of what makes this problem so challenging, Venkatasubramanian said. \u201cThe tendency in technology is to assume there is a single answer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s our instinct, it\u2019s how we\u2019ve been trained. It\u2019s not clear to me that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen here.\u201d&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story has been updated to reflect the current name of the AI Now Institute, and to clarify its relationship to Microsoft and Google.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Li Zhou is a technology reporter for POLITICO Pro&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2018 10:06:01 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>lzhou@politico.com (Li Zhou)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2018/02/07/algorithmic-bias-software-recommendations-000631</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Is tech dividing America?</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2018/02/07/technology-interview-mit-david-autor-000629</link>\n      <description>How an engine of prosperity split the haves from the have-nots \u2014 and how we can fix it.</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When Americans consider how technology has changed their lives, they tend to focus on how the internet and smartphones have altered how they watch TV, connect with friends, or how they shop. But those changes pale in comparison to how technology has already restructured the economy, shaking up the workforce and shifting opportunity to tech-centric urban hubs. As artificial intelligence quickly moves from fiction to daily reality, that revolution will arguably become much more consequential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economists broadly agree that technology will continue to be an engine of economic growth. But it also will upend old certainties about who benefits. Already, we can see a growing inequality gap, with winners and losers by region and workplace. The next wave of changes, handled badly, could make this gap even more extreme. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT researcher &lt;b&gt;David Autor&lt;/b&gt; has been at the center of that conversation for two decades now. One of the world\u2019s premier labor economists, Autor has helped drive a reconsideration of how Americans are really coping with the changes transforming their workplaces. And he's trying to take the conversation beyond the ivory tower: His 2016 &lt;a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/david_autor_why_are_there_still_so_many_jobs\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;TED talk&lt;/a&gt; about the surprising impact of automation, \u201cWhy Are There Still So Many Jobs?\u201d has been viewed more than 1.3 million times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autor's interest comes from seeing these changes at the ground level: Fresh out of Tufts University with a degree in psychology, he ended up running a Silicon Valley-sponsored computer-training program for at-risk children and adults at San Francisco\u2019s Glide Memorial Church, a counterculture hot spot. When he headed back to Harvard\u2019s John F. Kennedy School of Government for an M.A. and then Ph.D. in public policy, he brought a newly keen interest in figuring out how the technologies being pumped in to the labor market would shape what it means to be a worker in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autor says that both the optimists and the pessimists are wrong when it comes to America\u2019s ability to deal with technology\u2019s rise. On the plus side, robots won\u2019t put us all out of work. But we really do need to worry: Just because we\u2019ve made it through similar shifts before doesn\u2019t mean it will work out this time. National policy has a huge impact on how countries weather these changes, and there's reason for us to worry about how our leaders are facing the next wave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should take a lesson, says Autor, from how the discovery of crude remade Saudi Arabia and Norway. Oil revenue brought new prosperity to those countries, just as automation has been a boon to U.S. gross domestic product. But Saudi Arabia and Norway responded by adopting \u201cdifferent institutional arrangements,\u201d ones that left Saudi Arabia rich, unequal and unhappy, and Norway rich, egalitarian and happy. The choices facing the United States, he says, are similar\u2014whether the wealth will be segregated or shared. So far, he suggests, \u201cI don\u2019t think the U.S. is dealing with it especially well.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autor spoke to POLITICO just before attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We\u2019ve just started to think seriously as a nation about who wins and who doesn\u2019t as the American workplace automates. In 1998, you co-wrote &lt;a href=\"https://economics.mit.edu/files/11566\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; that showed the rise of technology in the workplace was actually proving to be good for higher-skilled workers. Is that a fair read?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What that paper suggested was that it's definitely the case that automation is raising the demand for skilled labor. And the work that I've done since has been about what set of activities are complemented by automation and which set of activities is displaced, pointing out that on the one hand, there were tasks that were creative and analytical, and on the other, tasks that required dexterity and flexibility, which were very difficult to automate. So the middle of the skill distribution, where there are well understood rules and procedures, is actually much more susceptible to automation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;So, there's a hollowing out of middle-class jobs, but high-skilled, high-wage workers and the low-skilled low-wage workers remain? Is that what we're seeing play out right now in the U.S.? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That polarization of jobs definitely reduced the set of opportunities for people who don't have a college degree. People who have a high school or lower degree, it used to be they were in manufacturing, in clerical and administrative support. Now, increasingly, they're in cleaning, home health, security, etc. Ironically, we've automated some of the stuff that was more interesting for us, and we're left with some of the stuff that is less interesting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that\u2019s still true, but it's probably not any longer the frontier. In the last five years, computer science has made an end run around that problem because the nature of artificial intelligence and machine learning is that you can get machines to do things that people don't understand. We don't have to explain, \u201cThese are the attributes of a chair.\u201d You just show a bunch of pictures of \u201cchair,\u201d and have the computer figure it out. I think there's always going to be huge demand for human expertise, judgment and creativity. Those traits will be scarce at least for the foreseeable future. What's becoming less scarce, what is now not scarce anymore, is people who can do repetitive cognitive or physical tasks, and I think there will be a lot more service tasks done by machinery over time. So, I do think that it's going to be more and more challenging for people without significant training to do high-paid work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;\u201cAutomation anxiety&amp;quot; is &lt;a href=\"https://economics.mit.edu/files/11678\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;overblown&lt;/a&gt;, you\u2019ve said. How anxious &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; American workers be? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are talking about how robots are going to take all the jobs, but we're in a time of very dramatic employment growth and have been for a decade. Job growth is robust throughout western Europe, as well. So, we're certainly not in a period where there's any outward sign that work is coming to an end. We have had two centuries of people worrying very vocally about how automation will make us superfluous. I don't think it's made us superfluous, and I don't think it's on the verge of making us superfluous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greater concern is not about the number of jobs but whether those jobs will pay decent wages and people will have sufficient skills to do them. That's the great challenge. It's never been a better time to be a highly educated worker in the western world. But there hasn't been a worse time to be a high school dropout or high school graduate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In recent years, we\u2019ve seen pushes to &lt;a href=\"https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/06/08/steve-case-innovation-venture-capital-fund-000447\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;spread Silicon Valley-style technological prosperity&lt;/a&gt; to other parts of the country. Does that have potential?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope so. People are talking about it, which is good, because they're not going to do anything about it if they're not talking about it. Whether talking about it will generate results is highly uncertain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do think it's absolutely the case that a lot of what we see\u2014a lot of the political dissatisfaction, as well\u2014comes from the fact that as average wealth and income in the U.S. have risen, it's a very, very geographically concentrated phenomenon. Most of that is basically New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Jose, Houston, Boston, and a couple other places. It's not broadly shared prosperity. A lot of the country is actually kind of downwardly mobile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, it's very misleading to just say, \u201cOh, well, average incomes are up.\u201d The economic geography is much spikier than it was 30 years ago. The hills and valleys are much, much steeper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In 2001, you wrote about &lt;a href=\"https://economics.mit.edu/files/11568\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;the idea of geographic arbitrage&lt;/a&gt;, or how companies were going to take advantage of people being able to live and work anywhere, thanks to the internet. My sense is that hasn't happened. If that\u2019s right, why hasn\u2019t it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree. You could have imagined a world where we all have Skype and mobile phones and broadband, and no one commutes anywhere, and we all live in our remote hilltop houses overlooking the water, and we'd have no reason to travel. But that doesn't appear to be the case at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears that remote and in-person communications are complements, not substitutes. Somehow the force of people wanting to clump together has actually, seemingly, if anything gotten stronger. And when we talk about these geographic inequalities, that's what we're seeing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;But you\u2019ve also written about &lt;a href=\"https://economics.mit.edu/files/12979\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;\u201csuperstar firms\u201d&lt;/a&gt; like Google, Facebook and Apple that are the powerful centers of gravity in Silicon Valley right now. Is part of the geographic concentration we\u2019re seeing that\u2014at least when it comes to tech\u2014there just aren\u2019t that many big companies to go around?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's true, and all the more so because they don't have that many employees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you look at the &lt;a href=\"http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?ID=2327285&amp;amp;c=176060&amp;amp;p=irol-newsArticle\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;top 20 candidate cities&lt;/a&gt; for Amazon to locate its second headquarters, it\u2019s Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Chicago. ... None of these is Gary, Indiana, right? These are not the down-and-out of cities. I'm not saying I blame them for that. That's a perfectly reasonable thing to do. But I think some people had it in mind that Amazon would go into some blighted metropolis and turn it around. That's clearly not what these choices suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Say you\u2019re Jeff Bezos. Would you pick Gary, Indiana?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. I wouldn't. But I'm sure he felt some pressure to do that, and it must have occurred to him that that would be a great thing to do if he could do it. I assume that they went through the process and said, \u2018Well, can we do this in Gary, Indiana? That place has been down and out since they made 'The Music Man.\u2019\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they must have looked into it and said, 'That's not going to fly. There are not enough educated people there. And we're not going to get them to move there because it's not a place they want to be.\u2019\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boston, where I live now, is growing explosively: Unemployment is incredibly low, real estate prices are really high, the city's getting much more crowded. So, you would think that companies would be running away. But Amazon, Microsoft and Google all have campuses within two blocks of my office at MIT. There's an agglomeration force that causes companies to want to move where other companies are. And talented people move where other talented people are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you're a local elected official on the other side of the desk, do you unambiguously want Amazon\u2019s headquarters? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Yes. Yeah. I don't see any downside to that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, it's going to create congestion and drive up real estate prices. But it's going to bring in talent, create jobs, create opportunity, raise wages\u2014and not just for people with Ph.D.s. It's going to raise wages for people who work at fast-food restaurants, drive for Uber, clean houses. So, these cities are not crazy to want the headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In just the past year, Silicon Valley as an industry has developed a good and evil reputation. It\u2019s cutting-edge and pays well, but it sometimes disrupts the world without seeming to care too much about the consequences, &lt;i&gt;a la&lt;/i&gt; Uber. Which is it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't think it's either. It creates a lot of benefits as well as creating real challenges: It's definitely the case that it's raising total GDP, but has been very dis-equalizing. It is up to our institutions to deal well with that or not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some countries have done a much better job at sharing the gains and making sure that everybody's bought in. Others have been much more social Darwinists about it, and the U.S. is very much at the extreme of that among industrialized economies, of going, &lt;i&gt;\u2018rah rah,\u2019&lt;/i&gt; to the winners and &lt;i&gt;\u2018too bad for you,\u2019&lt;/i&gt; to the losers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How, exactly, are other countries good at it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countries that, I think, are doing really well with this\u2014Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, Austria\u2014have very good educational systems that prepare people not just for highly educated, Ph.D.-level jobs, but also very good vocational, technical education systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there\u2019s also the notion that there are multiple stakeholders in the economy, not just shareholders. Workers have more voice, and that makes people less apprehensive about these changes because they expect that if they are gains, they'll get a piece of them, where in the U.S. a lot of people think, \u2018Well, there might be a gain, but I'll be worse off.\u2019 And they're probably right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other countries have made it a lot easier for people to feel comfortable about the changes they're bringing on themselves. I think that\u2019s one diagnosis of the current U.S. political system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You\u2019ve noted in your work that LBJ created a &lt;a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=26449\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;\u201cCommission on Technology, Automation, and Economic Progress\u201d&lt;/a&gt; way back in 1964. I didn\u2019t know whether to be encouraged by that or saddened by that\u2014that we\u2019ve been talking about these questions for a long time and don\u2019t seem to have any better answers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two schools of thought that you hear often. One is, \u2018the sky is falling, the robots are coming for our jobs, we're all screwed because we've made ourselves obsolete.\u2019 The other version you also hear a lot is, \u2018We've been through things like this in the past, it's all worked out fine, it took care of itself, don't worry.\u2019 And I think both of these are really wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've already indicated why I think the first view is wrong. The reason I think the second view is wrong is because I don't think it took care of itself. Countries have very different levels of quality of life, institutional quality, of democracy, of liberty and opportunity, and those are not because they have different markets or different technologies. It's because they've made different institutional arrangements. Look at the example of Norway and Saudi Arabia, two oil-rich countries. Norway is a very happy place. It's economically mobile with high rates of labor force participation, high rates of education, good civil society. And Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy that has high standards of living, but it's not a very happy place because they've stifled innovation and individual freedom. Those are two examples of taking the same technology, which is oil wealth, and either squandering it or investing it successfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the right lesson from history is that this is an opportunity. Things that raise GDP and make us more productive, they definitely create aggregate wealth. The question is, how do we use that wealth well to have a society that's mobile, that's prosperous, that's open? Or do we use it to basically make some people very wealthy and keep everyone else quiet? So, I think we are at an important juncture, and I don't think the U.S. is dealing with it especially well. Our institutions are very much under threat at a time when they're arguably most needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the time we\u2019ve been talking, Amazon's probably released a new AI product. As an academic, do you worry about keeping up with the pace of technology enough to usefully analyze it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, totally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nancy Scola is a senior technology reporter for POLITICO Pro&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2018 10:04:44 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>nscola@politico.com (Nancy Scola)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2018/02/07/technology-interview-mit-david-autor-000629</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>The least connected people in America</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2018/02/07/rural-indian-reservations-broadband-access-000628</link>\n      <description>Nowhere is the 'digital divide' more extreme than on tribal lands. Will Washington's solution fix the problem?</description>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;OROFINO, Idaho \u2014 Alexis Coomer's house isn't located in a remote area, at least not compared with many of her fellow Nez Perce tribe members on this reservation in north-central Idaho. She lives in the 3,000-person town of Orofino, the go-to place on the reservation where people load up on groceries and other supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when she needs to type an email, or help her daughter with homework, she drives 6 miles down the road, along the Clearwater River, and pulls into the Teweepuu Community Center, where she works as an administrative and events aide. There, she sits down in front of the computer she uses for work, which has the broadband hookup she lacks at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s not that far, but I just hate having to leave my house,\u201d Coomer said. \u201cI\u2019d rather just stay home.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As broadband internet becomes more and more important in the U.S. \u2014 the way Americans do everything from apply for jobs to chatting with their relatives to watching TV \u2014 one gap has become more glaring: the difference between those who have broadband and those who don't. An estimated 24 million people, about 8 percent of Americans, still have no home access to high-speed internet service, defined by the Federal Communications Commission as a download speed of 25 megabits per second. (That's what the FCC &lt;a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/guides/broadband-speed-guide\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; allows telecommuting or streaming high-definition video.) The overwhelming majority of those people live in rural areas, like farms or in big, poorly served areas like this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shorthand for fixing this problem is \u201cclosing the digital divide,&amp;quot; and FCC Chairman Ajit Pai says it's his top priority. But it has been a high-priority problem for years and remained persistently out of reach for reasons rooted in the structure of our telecommunications system itself. Internet access in the U.S. depends almost entirely on private companies; unlike other crucial services like postal delivery or electric power, it isn't considered the government's job, and isn't regulated as a public utility. But the limits of that system have become painfully apparent: Companies can't make money by running expensive wires to few customers, and a complex tangle of incentives offered by the government hasn't solved the problem in towns like Orofino. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowhere is the lack of broadband access more acute than in places like this: Rural Indian reservations have lower rates of coverage than anywhere else in the nation. About 35 percent of Americans living in tribal lands lack broadband access, according to the most recent &lt;a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-releases-2018-broadband-deployment-report\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the FCC. In Idaho, the FCC estimates that 83 percent of the tribal population lacks broadband, making the Nez Perce tribe among the least-connected groups in the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt seems like everybody has the internet, but not in my neighborhood,\u201d Coomer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem has been tackled by three FCC chairmen, by phone and satellite companies, and by the Nez Perce themselves, who launched a bootstrapped internet service in 2010 that currently supplies the libraries and other tribal buildings with a high-speed broadband connection. But service to most houses is still slow and expensive, if it's available at all. A local cable company offers a 15 Mbps connection for $80 a month, which Coomer says is too slow and unaffordable. Cellphones help fill the gap, but have severe limitations: Data plans are expensive and it\u2019s hard to do homework on a phone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the world, access to high-speed internet is increasingly seen not just as a convenience, but even a kind of &lt;a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/06/united-nations-report-internet-access-is-a-human-right.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;human right&lt;/a&gt;, the main tool people increasingly rely on to interact with the government, the economy and each other. Yet according to the FCC, more than 30 years after the U.S. government adopted the protocols that became the internet, 8 percent of Americans still can\u2019t connect to it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Pai and the FCC are going to find a way to bring quality internet to those Americans, they're going to have to figure out just how to solve the kind of problems that converge on this tiny salmon-fishing town, where residents look at the world they can see on their patchy connections and wonder if they'll ever catch up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThey could be doing some of the programming they have on the computer, advancing on their own, and they can\u2019t,&amp;quot; said Coomer of her four children, who use computers at school, but rely on less-useful smartphone&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;connections when they're home. &amp;quot;They don\u2019t have the convenience of just getting on the computer and looking something up.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RURAL BROADBAND MIGHT&lt;/b&gt; not be a headline political issue, but it's been on and off the Washington policy radar since at least 2010. That\u2019s when the FCC decided to tackle it on a broad scale and issued a National Broadband Plan&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;The idea was that companies needed a federal boost to make it feasible to serve rural customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan has several parts including something called the Connect America Fund, which in 2015 awarded $9 billion over six years to 10 telecom companies that agreed to deploy broadband in &lt;a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/maps/caf-2-accepted-map/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;rural areas&lt;/a&gt; across the country. In Idaho, a national telecom provider called CenturyLink is getting $6.3 million a year for six years to expand rural broadband service in the state. Century Link has pledged to bring service to 12,000 state residents; so far, about 500 homes on Nez Perce lands have benefited. A second company, Frontier Communications, is getting $5.2 million per year for six years to connect 10,000 residents in Idaho. But it\u2019s not clear if either company will hit their goals or how much of the reservation will eventually benefit, and at what speed; any connection at least 10 Mbps counts, even though that\u2019s less than the FCC\u2019s own 25 Mbps standard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What\u2019s more, reservation residents can\u2019t be sure if either company will eventually reach their neighborhoods. Broadband companies have some flexibility to choose which areas make the most sense to connect, so it won\u2019t be clear until the program ends in 2020 just which communities will be left out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The confusion isn\u2019t helped by the FCC\u2019s broadband maps, which are supposed to show which areas have broadband and which don\u2019t. But the agency acknowledges the maps have limitations. For instance, the FCC maps broadband according to census blocks, and considers a block &amp;quot;served&amp;quot; if a company offers broadband to at least one subscriber in the area, even if their neighbors can\u2019t get it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCC &lt;a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/maps/fixed-broadband-deployment-data/#lat=44.715514&amp;amp;lon=-115.576172&amp;amp;zoom=13\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;maps&lt;/a&gt; show splotches of high-speed broadband available in parts of Orofino, but Coomer\u2019s house is in an area colored blue \u2014 meaning there might be some providers in the area, but none that reach the FCC\u2019s benchmark speed. According to the FCC\u2019s 2016 broadband report, 7,793 out of 8,369 residents in Clearwater County, where Orofino is located, lack that kind of broadband access \u2014 about 93 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What you have is a problem where some customers are stranded, so to speak,&amp;quot; said Carol Mattey, a former FCC deputy bureau chief in the Obama administration, who helped develop broadband funding programs.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot;It's considered served, even though a pocket of it may not be served.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE NEZ PERCE&lt;/b&gt; aren't just waiting for help to arrive from Washington, or from telecom companies: Frustrated by the lack of connection, the tribe has cobbled together its own alternative &lt;a href=\"http://www.nezpercesystems.com/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;internet service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was originally inspired, of all things, by river otters. River otters are a bellwether for the health of the Clearwater River and the salmon who live in it. The Nez Perce are on a mission to restore the salmon populations in tributaries to the Columbia River, and in 2000, Danae Wilson, manager of the Nez Perce tribe\u2019s information technology department, realized that they needed internet service to do it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one, the tribal government needed to be able to communicate with some of the far-flung offices monitoring the rivers. Second, the Nez Perce had received a grant to study the health of river otters, but one of the conditions was that they had to send data back over the internet to be validated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, the local companies offering internet services charged a fortune for slow connections. Undeterred, Wilson set out to connect the tribal buildings by going for \u201cevery single grant you could think of.\u201d Eventually, through grants from the state of Idaho and the Department of Agriculture, the tribe built out its own wireless broadband system using microwave towers, and then connected tribal buildings to it using fiber. Then Wilson realized they could extend that internet service to residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tribe still runs the service, but Wilson is the first to tell you it\u2019s not exactly speedy. Nez Perce Tribe Wireless offers 3 Mbps for $25 a month, 6 Mbps for $45, and 9 Mbps for $65. Even the fastest of these speeds isn't close to the FCC's broadband benchmark of 25 Mbps. In nearby Lewiston, a town off the reservation, a cable provider offers service that\u2019s 11 times as fast for less: 100 Mbps for $55 a month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most residential customers using the tribe\u2019s service are on the 3 Mbps package, Wilson said. The tribe\u2019s community centers and the public schools use a direct fiber hookup, which is faster.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many residents, the slow speeds offered by the providers in the area, including sluggish satellite and DSL connections, aren\u2019t worth the cost, so they rely on public Wi-Fi instead. For Ken and Betty Bergman, this means walking several times a day to the tribe\u2019s KIYE radio station in the tiny town of Kamiah and sitting at a picnic table to use the station\u2019s Wi-Fi. Bergman does this to connect to the Idaho state website to file for his unemployment insurance. \u201cIt\u2019s really a pain, but you can get it done.\u201d Betty gets on the WiFi to check in with family members in California, including a sick sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bergmans said they don\u2019t have the money for internet service at home or to pay for a cellular data plan. Wi-Fi is their only internet link to the world outside Kamiah. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe probably go two to three times a day so I can check messages,\u201d Betty Bergman said. \u201cIt\u2019s too cold to sit here, so I go to the house and then come back out here. No matter rain, shine or snow, we come walking in it. I like to keep in touch with my family. This is the way I can keep in contact with my family.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tribe's service has some severe limits that affect home customers. The towers rely on a line-of-sight connection to the end user. Speeds are affected by trees, rock bluffs and an otherwise challenging terrain. A rainy day with fog obscuring the pines along the unforgiving hills means it\u2019s a \u201cslow internet day,\u201d Wilson said. A customer herself, Wilson said her signal shoots over two hills from a tower that\u2019s close to 6 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m paying for 9 megs, and if I get 5, I\u2019m really lucky,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cTo watch streaming media, I will log on and download a movie, and then cook dinner and then we can sit down. It takes time.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there are pockets of residents scattered throughout the reservation the tribe\u2019s service can\u2019t reach at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of them is D\u2019Lisa Penney, principal of Lapwai High School, who gets her home internet service from HughesNet, a satellite provider, a sluggish connection&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;that involves a satellite dish and line drilled through the logs of her cabin. It\u2019s better than nothing, but not enough for her to work from home or for her teenage son to take online classes \u2014 an important tool for rural residents who want to beef up credentials or take advantage of educational opportunities that otherwise would be out of reach. Penney is fortunate that she has a high-speed connection at work, and she and her son put in long hours at the high school after hours, to take online classes or watch video of a lecture or even open a Google document. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThere are things at school I can do superquick, but at home, it\u2019s a dinosaur,\u201d Penney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her brother, Aaron Penney, runs the Nez Perce Tribal Hatchery, which is working to restore the decimated salmon population. The hatchery collects data on the thousands of fish it spawns and tracks, including genetics, scales and length. It has a line-of-sight connection to the tip of one of the tribe\u2019s towers, which means some internet service, but the slow speeds mean the workers can\u2019t just log the data as they collect it. Instead, they need to write it down by hand and slowly upload it into a shared database later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019d like to see high-speed internet capability here,\u201d Aaron Penney said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming, I would say.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson wants to improve the tribe\u2019s service for the hatcheries \u2014 there are four on the reservation \u2014 as well as residents who are thwarted by the topography. But that means building new towers, and that takes money the tribe doesn\u2019t have. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou really feel like you\u2019re leaving people behind,\u201d Wilson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AS THE NEZ PERCE&lt;/b&gt; experience suggests, one of the biggest problems with wiring rural America is that every area has its own collection of issues: A sparsely populated landscape full of ridges and creeks is far harder to wire than an urban apartment building or a cookie-cutter suburb. One-size-fits-all solutions just don't fit very well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCC chairman says things are changing under his watch. Pai has reworked subsidy programs to redirect funding to rural areas that still lack service and has modernized rules in an effort to encourage companies to invest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI think we\u2019re at the dawn of some really great innovations in terms of our stewardship of public funds as well as private sector initiatives,\u201d Pai said in an interview. \u201cWe just need more time to let those initiatives blossom and to see how far they go in reducing that percentage of the unserved.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However slowly, the federal efforts are making some progress at the national level: A &lt;a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-releases-2018-broadband-deployment-report\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released earlier this month said that in 2016, 35 percent of residents of tribal areas lacked access to broadband, down from 41 percent in 2014. Providers using Connect America subsidies say they have built out broadband connections to 1.5 million locations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pai acknowledges the commission\u2019s mapping problem, and said the agency is updating the way it collects information from providers in an attempt to more accurately understand which areas of the country really have broadband. He described it as an ongoing process that is extremely labor-intensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also believes things could improve with a new idea the FCC is trying: a &amp;quot;reverse auction&amp;quot; being held this summer in which providers will compete for subsidies to fund broadband in parts of the country that lack speedy service, including areas on the Nez Perce reservation. The agency plans to award up to $2 billion over the next decade to companies to deploy broadband in areas that aren\u2019t being served through the private sector or by other subsidized companies. (The &amp;quot;reverse&amp;quot; means that companies will compete to offer the lowest bids for the best service.) Pai said the agency took pains to ensure that a range of companies can participate, including some of the country\u2019s rural electric cooperatives, which have expressed interest in adding internet to the electric services they already provide to remote regions. The cooperatives have historically focused on their core business, but see opportunities to add broadband to their services because they are already laying fiber connections&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;for smart grid management, and it\u2019s a service their customers are increasingly demanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the chairman, success will mean that when he travels throughout the country \u2014 Pai is fond of road trips to rural areas \u2014 residents will have the same ability to use the internet as their urban counterparts. \u201cThere\u2019s no numerical threshold, but I have a feeling we\u2019ll know it when we see it,\u201d Pai said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattey understands the frustrations of people who are still waiting for service \u2013 she worked on the funding program for seven years \u2014 but cautions that it\u2019s too early to be pessimistic.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;She compared bringing broadband to rural America to the construction of the interstate highway system or rural electrification. \u201cIn each case, it took 10 or 20 years to get it completely done,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s unrealistic for people to think it\u2019s going to happen in a year.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blair Levin, a former FCC official who worked on the national broadband plan, says policymakers confronting the rural broadband problem need to start thinking of it as an investment in public infrastructure that will yield larger social benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cAmerica is very good at certain things and very bad at certain things,\u201d Levin said. \u201cWe\u2019re not so good at investing in the common good\u2026 We can see common benefits, but the political forces don\u2019t align to fund them.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the tribe\u2019s part, the Nez Perce are planning to compete in the upcoming auction themselves to go after funding to extend broadband to areas, like the hatcheries, that lack access. They don\u2019t feel like they can count on private companies to ever get around to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf we\u2019re not doing it ourselves,&amp;quot; Wilson said, &amp;quot;it just isn\u2019t getting done.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Margaret Harding McGill is a technology reporter for POLITICO Pro&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2018 10:04:06 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>mmcgill@politico.com (Margaret Harding McGill)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2018/02/07/rural-indian-reservations-broadband-access-000628</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Trump speaks after visiting Florida high school shooting victims</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/video/2018/02/16/trump-speaks-after-visiting-shooting-victims-065068</link>\n      <description/>\n      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 03:32:06 GMT</pubDate>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/video/2018/02/16/trump-speaks-after-visiting-shooting-victims-065068</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Donald Trump remarks on Florida high school shooting</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/video/2018/02/15/donald-trump-remarks-on-florida-high-school-shooting-065046</link>\n      <description/>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 16:38:52 GMT</pubDate>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/video/2018/02/15/donald-trump-remarks-on-florida-high-school-shooting-065046</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Pelsoi: I'd lose an election to win gun legislation</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/video/2018/02/15/pelsoi-id-lose-an-election-to-win-gun-legislation-065052</link>\n      <description/>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 20:07:46 GMT</pubDate>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/video/2018/02/15/pelsoi-id-lose-an-election-to-win-gun-legislation-065052</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Playback: Trump's generous lawyer</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/video/2018/02/15/playback-trumps-generous-lawyer-065045</link>\n      <description/>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 17:44:52 GMT</pubDate>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/video/2018/02/15/playback-trumps-generous-lawyer-065045</guid>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Melania Trump\u2019s \u2018volunteer\u2019 rankles White House staff with her all-access pass</title>\n      <link>https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/melania-trumps-volunteer-rankles-white-house-staff-with-her-all-access-pass-415669</link>\n      <description/>\n      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;First lady Melania Trump\u2019s friend and special adviser Stephanie Winston Wolkoff has enjoyed a unique and eyebrow-raising setup over the past year: In her status as a \u201ccontracted volunteer,\u201d the Manhattan socialite has a government-issued phone and computer, as well as a blue badge that grants her total access to the West Wing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, unlike other administration officials, the former Vogue event planner continues to live in New York City and  pops into the White House only every few weeks, where her on-paper job is to consult with the first lady on her initiatives, according to two White House officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That special arrangement has soured colleagues in the White House, who have long seen Wolkoff as a person capitalizing on her relationship with the first lady while offering little in return. \u201cOne thing that grates at people is she is supposed to work at the White House, but she still gets to live in New York City,\u201d said one administration official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that unique status is now in question, after The New York Times reported on Thursday that President Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural committee paid close to $26 million to an event-planning firm that was founded by Wolkoff, and that she personally pocketed at least $1.62 million from the committee that was supposed to donate any remaining funds to charity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cMrs. Trump had no involvement with the [Presidential Inaugural Committee], and had no knowledge of how funds were spent,\u201d said her spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now the question circulating in the White House is whether the first lady will take any action to sever ties with the special adviser over her self-enriching setup \u2014 quick action that would mark a style change from the West Wing, where the president often dawdles in firing his advisers, or has other people do the deed for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grisham did not shoot down rumors that the first lady is considering cutting off the professional relationship for good. When asked whether Wolkoff would be fired, Grisham said: \u201cStephanie Winston Wolkoff is a contracted volunteer with the Office of the First Lady and has specified duties as outlined in her contract.\u201d Wolkoff is not paid a government salary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the White House, the arrangement she enjoys with the first lady has long struck other staffers as odd. \u201cThe fact that so much was given to her company has really raised eyebrows,\u201d said one administration official. \u201cThat\u2019s a whole lot of money, especially when a bunch of that could have been donated to charity.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolkoff did not immediately respond to a request for comment concerning her future status in the White House. Tom Barrack, a longtime friend of the president's, who served as chairman of the Presidential Inaugural Committee, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 18:25:08 GMT</pubDate>\n      <author>akarni@politico.com (Annie Karni)</author>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/melania-trumps-volunteer-rankles-white-house-staff-with-her-all-access-pass-415669</guid>\n    </item>\n  </channel>\n</rss>\n",
