Its blend of role-playing action, gorgeous visual design and evocative music remains a treat even today. The series has persisted across multiple generations since, but the original is still best. Or is it? Last week, Square-Enix released a 3D remake for PS4, PS4 Pro, PC and even PS Vita - and we've played them all.</p><p>But what makes this game special? Secret of Mana holds up today and was considered good enough to make the top 21 line-up for SNES mini, and this is perhaps surprising bearing in mind its troubled development. Originally designed for the Super NES's CD-ROM attachment, a collaboration with Sony, the game was originally lined up as a launch title for the Super Disc format - a vast adventure that would take full advantage of the extra disc space rather than simply slapping a few Redbook audio tracks on the disc like many other titles. When the CD project was killed off, Square management pushed the team to complete the game on cartridge instead. The team was forced to cut content and dialogue, reducing the game to the form we know today but despite obvious shortcomings resulting from this process, the game still went on to become a classic.</p><p>The action driven combat stands out as its most unique feature - up to three players can join-in for cooperative action, quite unlike anything else on the system at the time. While exploring the world in search of the eight Mana temples, players are treated to remarkable 16-bit pixel art. Beyond the expressive characters, beautiful rivers ripple through the numerous valleys, animated grass tiles blow gently in the wind and colour math is used to create some great effects.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2018-secret-of-mana-3d-remake-analysis\">Read more&hellip;</a></p>]]></description>\n\t\t<link>http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2018-secret-of-mana-3d-remake-analysis</link>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=1956555</guid>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 10:30:00 +0000</pubDate>\t</item>\n\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The retro gaming industry could be killing video game preservation</title>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img src=\"//images.eurogamer.net/2018/articles/2018-02-09-12-01/the-retro-gaming-industry-could-be-killing-video-game-preservation-1518177692382.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1954974.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p>There's arguably never been a better time to play older games. Companies like Nintendo and Sega are reconnecting players with their heritage via products such as the SNES Classic Edition and the smartphone-based Sega Forever range, while a flood of third-party companies like Analogue, Hyperkin, Retro-Bit and AtGames are manufacturing clone systems which offer a means of playing original cartridges with creature comforts such as HD output, save states and much more besides. On top of that, we've seen vintage games appear on a myriad of digital storefronts, most notably the Nintendo Virtual Console and Switch eShop, the latter of which has been getting fresh Neo Geo games each and every month since launch thanks to Japanese company Hamster.</p><p>The fast-moving nature of the games industry and the dizzying number of different consoles, each with their own unique technical specifications and foibles, once led some experts to ominously predict that unlike music, TV and film - mediums which can be easily transferred from format to format as new storage technologies appear - video games were in danger of being locked in the past, fenced-off behind the peculiarities of their host hardware. Emulation has done an excellent job of preventing this grim future, but ironically the new-found commercial success of this burgeoning sector could end up crippling its long-term prospects.</p><p>One of the more recent emulation success stories is the freely-available RetroArch, a downloadable frontend which works in conjunction with backend application Libretro. It has become one of the most respected means of playing old games on modern hardware; it's available on Android, Windows, Mac, Linux and (unofficially, thanks to the efforts of industrious hackers) the Nintendo Switch. \"Contrary to how most people perceive it, RetroArch is not an emulator in the traditional sense,\" explains Daniel De Matteis, software developer and current lead of both RetroArch and Libretro. \"RetroArch/Libretro is a frontend/backend project that seeks to create its own ecosystem of software that runs as dynamically pluggable code.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-02-09-the-retro-gaming-industry-could-be-killing-video-game-preservation\">Read more&hellip;</a></p>]]></description>\n\t\t<link>http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-02-09-the-retro-gaming-industry-could-be-killing-video-game-preservation</link>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=1954974</guid>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\t</item>\n\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Can Kingdom Come Deliverance's tech deliver its ambitious vision?</title>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img src=\"//images.eurogamer.net/2018/articles/2018-02-17-12-50/digitalfoundry-2018-kingdom-come-deliverance-console-analysis-1518871818526.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1956523.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p>Conceptually, Kingdom Come Deliverance is an intriguing proposition. What if the Elder Scrolls formula were transplanted across to a real-world location, steeped in history? And what if Skyrim's less than state-of-the-art technological underpinnings were replaced with one of the most powerful game engines on the market? </p><p>As the debut project from Czech developer Warhorse Studios, this ambitious, crowdfunded RPG uses the CryEngine technology - as seen in the likes of Ryse, Prey and Homefront the Revolution - but with a Skyrim-style canvas of terrain to explore. From beautiful, dense woodlands to idyllic early 15th century European villages, there's a grounded, almost photorealistic look to the world in many areas. The big difference next to a game like Skyrim though, is the swapping out of fantasy elements for a more historical setting. Dragons and magic are out, and the focus here is on a brutal power struggle in the Kingdom of Bohemia.</p><p>It would be remiss of us not point out the controversy surrounding this title based on the attitudes of Daniel V\u00c3\u00a1vra, the lead developer, whose views speak for themselves in both his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanielVavra\" target=\"_blank\">social media</a> and <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/my-e3-meeting-with-a-pro-gamergate-developer-1715511964\" target=\"_blank\">this Kotaku interview</a> - aspects of which are reflected in the game content, and may give pause in considering it for purchase. It's a topic Eurogamer will address in its review, but the focus for this Digital Foundry piece is its technology and performance.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2018-kingdom-come-deliverance-console-analysis\">Read more&hellip;</a></p>]]></description>\n\t\t<link>http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2018-kingdom-come-deliverance-console-analysis</link>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=1956523</guid>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 13:28:00 +0000</pubDate>\t</item>\n\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Jelly Deals roundup: Nintendo Switch bundles, Dark Souls Remastered, 4K TVs and more</title>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img src=\"//images.eurogamer.net/2018/articles/2018-02-16-09-09/dark_souls_nintendo_switch.jpeg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1956225.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p>\n  <em>A note from the editor: <a href=\"http://www.jelly.deals?utm_source=eurogamer.net&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=deals_post\" target=\"_blank\">Jelly Deals</a> is a deals site launched by our parent company, Gamer Network, with a mission to find the best bargains out there.

There are key enhancements here - a seamless open world with no loading, dynamic time of day and weather rendering plus a new system for dealing with animation and in-game physics. However, what's immediately clear from booting up the game is that Dynasty Warriors 9 has issues. Despite the inclusion of performance and image quality orientated modes (on all systems bar base Xbox One), frame-rate is sub-par, no matter which system you own or which mode you use. At best it's sub-optimal, at worst it's a mess.</p><p>What's also curious is that the implementation of the 'action' and 'movie' modes varies across platforms. So, let's kick off with what we thought would be the most optimal way to play the game - action mode on PS4 Pro and Xbox One X. In both cases, frame-rate is unlocked and v-sync is disabled, meaning that the uneven action is accompanied by ever-present screen-tearing. Busy scenes drop to the low-20s here - not exactly the kind of performance level we'd expect from the enhanced consoles. Pro runs at 1080p resolution, but Xbox One X trumps it with a native 1440p framebuffer - albeit with some cutbacks to the visual feature set and an overall <em>lower</em> level of performance.</p><p>Movie mode on both systems often drops performance to the 20fps level - sometimes dipping beneath - but the actual implementation varies here. Xbox One X appears to just turn v-sync on, effectively giving users a Hobson's choice of continual tearing or obvious judder. As the arrival of each new frame in movie mode is tied to the display refresh, frame-rate also drops noticeably. Aside from that, we could see no real difference between the two modes.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2018-dynasty-warriors-9-performance-analysis\">Read more&hellip;</a></p>]]></description>\n\t\t<link>http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2018-dynasty-warriors-9-performance-analysis</link>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=1956515</guid>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 11:49:00 +0000</pubDate>\t</item>\n\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Here's how PUBG on mobile phones compares to the original game</title>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img src=\"//images.eurogamer.net/2018/articles/2018-02-16-14-51/-1518792661760.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1956411.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p>Earlier this week, a live action trailer for PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds was released and it quickly went viral. There were two main reason for this; firstly it was excellently produced and exciting to watch, but the real surprise was that it was advertising PUBG on mobile phones.  Yes, you heard right, PUBG, the game Team Eurogamer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTZXfIDHhP2u7bMJFxd6U_o6CK2h7DxIA\">play way too much of</a>, is now playable on Android and iOS devices. Bonkers!</p><p>Getting to play PUBG on mobile is a bit of a mission, however, as it's currently only available to download in China. Happily, there are a couple of ways to trick the system and play the game in your own region and it's not especially hard to do. I mean, if I can work out how to get it working on my iPhone 6, surely you can.</p><p>Be warned though, it turns out there are actually TWO official PUBG mobile games available to download. PUBG: Army Attack puts an arcade style spin on the original concept and includes things like naval battles, whilst PUBG: Exhilarating Battlefield (or PUBGEB as I've decided to call it) comes much closer to recreating the feel of PUBG on the PC.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-02-16-heres-how-pubg-on-mobile-phones-compares-to-the-original-game\">Read more&hellip;</a></p>]]></description>\n\t\t<link>http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-02-16-heres-how-pubg-on-mobile-phones-compares-to-the-original-game</link>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=1956411</guid>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 09:47:00 +0000</pubDate>\t</item>\n\t<item>\n\t\t<title>I owe everything I am to Buck Rogers: Countdown to Doomsday</title>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img src=\"//images.eurogamer.net/2018/articles/2018-02-16-13-42/-1518788569134.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1956391.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p>I can still remember when I first laid my eyes on it. On a shelf full of the usual mid-1990s suspects - Streets of Rage, Sonic the Hedgehog, Revenge of Shinobi, so many sports games - Buck Rogers: Countdown to Doomsday stood out. A distinctive red box with some garish and heroic art, it couldn't help but stand out. I'd later learn this was the NTSC version of the game (fortunately, it was region-free), but for now, that just made it look a bit exotic for an 11-year-old who mostly bought into the 'judge a game by its cover' conceit. At that moment, I was just delighted that I'd stumbled across this game at a rare time when I had \u00c2\u00a315 to spend. \u00c2\u00a315! It was a veritable fortune back then, and this proved to be the perfect investment.</p><p>I had an almost idyllic childhood: happy parents who loved each other and did everything to support me and make our lives exciting and enjoyable. We never had much money, but ultimately, that didn't really matter. While money gives you opportunity, it doesn't always give you happiness, and my youth was rich with that which you can't buy. What the lack of money did mean was that the rare occasions when I was given a decent sum of money, and sent into a game shop to buy something? Those were a really big deal.</p><p>I had to spend wisely. I knew this wouldn't happen again for a while. I glanced at Pel\u00c3\u00a9 briefly. Not the footballer, of course - that'd be an unusual encounter in South Wales - but the Megadrive game of the same name that I suspect was probably a bit dodgy. There'd be no value for money there. This purchase needed to last me a long time. I already had a FIFA game and I was almost as rubbish at that as I was at actual football - despite being so enthusiastic.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-02-17-i-owe-everything-i-am-to-buck-rogers-countdown-to-doomsday\">Read more&hellip;</a></p>]]></description>\n\t\t<link>http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-02-17-i-owe-everything-i-am-to-buck-rogers-countdown-to-doomsday</link>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=1956391</guid>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\t</item>\n\t<item>\n\t\t<title>System Shock reboot put on &quot;hiatus&quot;, 18 months after it raised $1.3 million on Kickstarter</title>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img src=\"//images.eurogamer.net/2018/articles/2018-02-17-00-07/system-shock-reboot-put-on-hiatus-18-months-after-it-raised-1-3-million-on-kickstarter-1518826033264.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1956493.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p>Developer Nightdive Studios has announced that it's putting its highly anticipated System Shock reboot on \"hiatus\" after letting \"things get out of control\", just 18 months after the project was successfully Kickstarted to the tune of $1,350,700 USD.</p><p>Originally pitched as a remake of Looking Glass Technologies' classic first-person sci-fi horror System Shock, Nightdive's project quickly ballooned in scope.

It comes with all the usual new features - some new mechanics, buildings, several more historically significant leaders, and so on. But it also brought some smaller, under-the-radar changes - one of which in particular has had a mixed reaction from fans.</p><p>The issue centres around Firaxis' addition of more Hidden Agendas for its various leaders, and a couple of those new Agendas in particular: \"Flirtatious\" and \"Curmudgeon\". The former means a leader will like other civilizations that have leaders of the opposite sex, and dislike those of the same sex. The latter the opposite: disliking the opposite sex and liking those the same as their own.</p><p>If you're not familiar, Agendas are basically the goals, or playstyles, that are given to for each AI-controlled civilization's leader in a game. They come in two forms: fixed agendas that generally suit that leader's overall theme, like Queen Victoria's desire for imperialistic expansion with \"Sun Never Sets\"; and Hidden Agendas, which are randomly assigned and a bit more light-hearted about adding personality - maybe a leader is \"Fun Loving\" and wants to keep their citizens well entertained, or \"Nuke Happy\" and won't hesitate to pelt you with a few ICBMs when the mood takes them. These new ones fall under the latter.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-02-16-civ-6s-sexist-leaders-are-getting-tweaked\">Read more&hellip;</a></p>]]></description>\n\t\t<link>http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-02-16-civ-6s-sexist-leaders-are-getting-tweaked</link>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=1955669</guid>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 09:57:00 +0000</pubDate>\t</item>\n\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Deadly Premonition creator teases next project The Missing</title>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img src=\"//images.eurogamer.net/2018/articles/2018-02-16-09-35/-1518773723517.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1956314.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p>Hidetaka \"Swery\" Suehiro, creator of the delightfully bizarre Deadly Premonition and D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die, has teased his next game: The Missing.</p><p>The project will launch for consoles in 2018, Swery announced in a new video to fans.</p><p>\"The title, 'The Missing', has many meanings,\" Swery said. \"A missing person, someone who's lost, or even something lost.

In Fe you don't just get to talk to the monsters - you get to sing to them, or at least, croak and wail tunefully, like a sheepdog trying to nail the backing vocals to Bohemian Rhapsody. An \"EA Original\" from Swedish developer Zoink - otherwise known for such comicbook fare as Zombie Vikings: Stab-a-thon - Fe is the story of a nimble fox creature on a mission to save a vivid dreamland from a legion of strange armoured figures, who are capturing and processing the wildlife to unknown end. </p><p>It's a game about healing rifts between lifeforms, about symbiosis and diversity versus entrapment and exploitation, and integral to all that is the singing mechanic. As in a Metroidvania, you'll need to obtain certain abilities to push deeper into Fe's persistent, multiple-region map, which extends from glowering lava caves and sherbet yellow swamps to chilly blue mountain-tops. Some of these abilities are bog-standard incremental power-ups, acquired by collecting purple crystals, but the majority take the form of animal calls and chants, used to woo the realm's critters and flora into doing your bidding. </p><p>If you know a creature's language, you can hold right trigger to sing with it, increasing or reducing pressure to change pitch. Harmonise with the other animal for a few seconds - as indicated by a glowing waveform between mouths, which creates the unnerving impression that you're tongue-wrestling it into submission - and it will consent to follow you around and help you overcome any obstacles nearby. Birds will illuminate the route to your current objective, their wingtips scribbling golden paths in the air like the scoutflies of Monster Hunter World. Boars will clear away clogs of blue fungus, or carry you up slippery hills of ice. Stags will flatten any hostiles you lure into their territory.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-02-14-fe-review\">Read more&hellip;</a></p>]]></description>\n\t\t<link>http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-02-14-fe-review</link>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=1955878</guid>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 06:55:00 +0000</pubDate>\t</item>\n\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Delightful piano-themed rhythm game Deemo gets 24 free new tracks on Switch</title>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img src=\"//images.eurogamer.net/2018/articles/2018-02-16-01-58/supremely-lovely-touch-based-switch-music-game-deemo-gets-25-free-new-tracks-and-controller-support-1518746322636.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1956281.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p>Supremely lovely Switch rhythm game Deemo has just been updated with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CIRCLE_Ent/status/964154807450775552\" target=\"_blank\">24 free new songs</a> and controller support.</p><p>Deemo is another stellar rhythm action game from developer Rayark, the music game specialist responsible for the wonderful Voez.

This puzzle-platformer that plays like a Lemmings-lite puts you in the role of a fantastically moustachioed Cloud God tasked with guiding a group of pilgrims to safety across six increasingly dangerous worlds.</p><p>Deriving its name from its eye-catching 2D-meets-3D art style, Pop-up Pilgrims really does look like a pop-up book come to life. Each level consists of multiple platforms that the pilgrims must cross safely in order to reach the exit and progress. In VR these platforms pop out at you from the animated backdrop, providing overlapping layers and a unique sense of depth. Each of the 60+ levels are set out in a concave curve from left to right, creating a kind of vertical half-pipe stage in which you sit, dead centre, conducting the action.</p><p>Having the levels wrap around like this is wonderful; it's like being encased inside your very own papercraft theatre. While it is possible to turn your gaze 360 degrees and look behind yourself, you'll never need to. Pop-up Pilgrim's sedentary, forward-facing gameplay means at most, there'll be the occasional look left or right to find some out-of-the-way platforms. There's certainly nothing there that'll give you a crick in the neck after some extended game time.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-02-14-pop-up-pilgrims-review\">Read more&hellip;</a></p>]]></description>\n\t\t<link>http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-02-14-pop-up-pilgrims-review</link>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=1955952</guid>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\t</item>\n\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Now Dragon Ball FighterZ players are coming up with solo Touch of Death combos</title>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img src=\"//images.eurogamer.net/2018/articles/2018-02-15-13-41/now-dragon-ball-fighterz-players-are-coming-up-with-solo-touch-of-death-combos-1518702068526.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1956152.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p>Now Dragon Ball FighterZ, the wonderful fighting game from Arc System Works based on the famous anime, has been out for a few weeks, advanced players are coming up with some stunning combos.

And that ceaseless ebb and surge of tiny, ravenous bodies, darting at your heels only to wince back from the glare of your torch. A Plague Tale's corner of 14th century France is home to many terrors - the black death, the Inquisition, raiding English soldiers - but the most tenacious and oppressive are the rats, a lethal mass swirling through towns hollowed out by disease and erupting from the shambles of battlefields. It's a threat you must learn to live with, while guiding nobleman's daughter Amicia and her sickly infant brother Hugo to sanctuary, and a threat you can turn to your advantage. The rats aren't fussy about who they devour, after all, and one girl's chittering Gothic metaphor is another girl's handy terrain trap.</p><p>As that gruesome notion may suggest, Innocence's narrative is all about the loss of it. Created by Asobo Studios, a developer otherwise known for contract work on projects like Quantum Break, it's a third-person \"single-player co-op\" odyssey in the tradition of The Last of Us, where the the rigours of travel catalyse a deepening relationship between the character you control, Amicia, and the frail soul in her charge. As the story begins, Amicia and Hugo are forced to flee their castle home by the Inquisition's appearance. Why the Church's enforcers are after them remains to be seen but presumably has to do with Hugo's mysterious terminal affliction, which is styled a \"blood curse\" by other characters. </p><p>The pair aren't close, to begin with. Hugo has been quarantined since birth, and Amicia isn't exactly the cuddly big sister: she harbours a certain bitterness about her brother's greater share of their mother's attention. Having been left to her own devices as a child, Amicia is also independent and resourceful where Hugo is (at first) clingy and easily spooked. It's a relationship that comes across in a variety of small ways as you play - so far, the emphasis is on such passing interactions rather than cutscenes. At one point in our demo, which occurs a third of the way through this 10-12 hour story, Hugo appears brandishing a dead man's shield, prompting Amicia to snap at him incredulously. Hugo's naivety is to some degree an asset, insulating him against a full understanding of the horrors all around. \"Do you think we're hurting them?\" he frets, as the pair step gingerly over corpses while attempting to reach a distant chateau.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-02-14-a-plague-tale-innocence-wants-to-be-the-last-of-us-with-rats\">Read more&hellip;</a></p>]]></description>\n\t\t<link>http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-02-14-a-plague-tale-innocence-wants-to-be-the-last-of-us-with-rats</link>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=1955846</guid>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\t</item>\n\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Rita Ora joins the cast of the upcoming Detective Pikachu movie</title>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img src=\"//images.eurogamer.net/2018/articles/2018-02-14-23-42/rita-ora-joins-the-cast-of-the-upcoming-detective-pikachu-movie-1518651746972.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1955998.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p>British singer and actor Rita Ora  <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/rita-ora-joins-ryan-reynolds-pokemon-movie-detective-pikachu-1084233\" target=\"_blank\">will star alongside Ryan Reynolds</a> and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom's Justice Smith, in yet another surprise casting twist for the already eclectic, in-production live-action Detective Pikachu movie.</p><p>Reynolds, of course, is <a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-12-07-ryan-reynolds-cast-as-pikachu-in-live-action-pokemon-movie\" target=\"_blank\">providing the voice and motion capture</a> for the film's computer-generated Detective Pikachu character.

With that in mind, it'll come as little surprise to see much the same situation with the first game, but the difference this time is that the original Bayonetta is also available on PC and Xbox 360 (we'd best not mention the PS3 version) so how well does the Switch version compare to all of its rivals?</p><p>To begin with, just as we saw with Bayonetta 2's Switch port, the original also operates at 1280x720, bringing it into line with the existing console versions. On the surface, this is disappointing bearing in mind the extra power of Nintendo's latest hardware, but as we'll discover later, there are benefits. And that's not to say some improvements haven't been made to general image quality. For example, Switch's texturing is slightly improved over Wii U. It's a difference so subtle, it may well come down to a difference in hardware implementation, but other changes do seem to be more than that - for example, improved edge aliasing when models are presented against field of view, along with adjustments to the depth of field effect itself, environment shading and bloom lighting.</p><p>Up against the PC version, the comparisons are intriguing - Platinum delivered improved shadow quality and higher resolution options, but texture quality is around the same suggesting that all existing editions of the game are indeed based on the Xbox 360 original. Differences with the Microsoft platform are again minimal: shadow implementation varies and the Switch version isn't quite as vibrant, but overall, there's little to separate the two.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2018-is-switch-bayonetta-the-definitive-console-version\">Read more&hellip;</a></p>]]></description>\n\t\t<link>http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2018-is-switch-bayonetta-the-definitive-console-version</link>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=1955885</guid>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2018 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\t</item>\n\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Behind the sunless scenes</title>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<img src=\"//images.eurogamer.net/2018/articles/2018-02-14-11-34/behind-the-sunless-scenes-1518608075778.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1955864.jpg\" alt=\"\"/><p>A year ago, Fallen London and Sunless Sea developer Failbetter Games successfully pitched Sunless Skies on Kickstarter. The upcoming project was funded in four hours and its crowdfunding campaign concluded with nearly 400 per cent of the money needed to smash its financial target. In September last year, Failbetter won a GamesIndustry.biz award for being one of the best employers in the UK video games industry. The team gave enthusiastic quotes to Eurogamer's sister site about the benefits of working at the tiny, tightknit outfit. Failbetter, seemingly, was on a high.</p><p>But last week the London-based studio surprised fans and Sunless Skies backers alike with the news it had delayed the game and would cut four staff - a quarter of that same, tiny studio. Those who had talked so positively of life at Failbetter just six months prior were among those headed out the door. Failbetter announced the delay and lay-offs via a blog post which blamed redundancies on a need to slim down its workforce and work on one Sunless Skies-shaped project at a time, a move it said was necessary to protect the future of the company. The news came out of the blue for Failbetter fans, but for staff at the studio, it came as no surprise. </p><p>Eurogamer was alerted to the upcoming layoffs and complaints of poor management at the studio several weeks ago, and over the past month I have spoken with around a dozen Failbetter staff, past and present, both before and after the company made its public announcement. These claims have found voice in Failbetter's former boss Alexis Kennedy, who left the company in 2016 but has remained close to the team he founded, and a number of others who have chosen to speak out but wished to remain anonymous for the sake of their careers. These complaints have also, it is equally worth noting, been broadly denied by the studio's board and the majority of other Failbetter staff continuing at the studio.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-02-14-behind-the-sunless-scenes\">Read more&hellip;</a></p>]]></description>\n\t\t<link>http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-02-14-behind-the-sunless-scenes</link>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=1955864</guid>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2018 12:43:00 +0000</pubDate>\t</item>\n\n</channel>\n</rss>\t\t",
