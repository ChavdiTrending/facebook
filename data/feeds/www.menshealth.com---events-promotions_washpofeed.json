When Red Bull invited me out to catch the action for myself and try my hand at surfing, I was definitely up for the workout challenge. Catching a wave itself doesn\u2019t burn a ton of calories, but paddling out, then popping up and balancing on the board recruits muscles in your arms, legs, and core.</p>\n<p>It was only once I got to Turtle Bay Resort that I first had a glimpse at the ocean. When they say the waves are big in the North Shore, they\u2019re not kidding. Even just at the resort\u2019s beach, the waves topped anything I\u2019d seen in New York, LA, Washington.</p>\n<p><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">Related</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/best-surfing-lessons-hotels-vacation\">10 Hotels That'll Help You Become a Better Surfer</a></p>\n<h2>First, we tried rock running.</h2>\n<p>If you\u2019ve seen <em data-redactor-tag=\"em\">Blue Crush</em>, you may remember the scene where Kate Bosworth and Michelle Rodriguez are running with a rock along the bottom of the ocean. It\u2019s called rock running, and surfers do it in real life to help with breath training, cardio, and to work on being calm while stuck underwater. It\u2019s a form of hypoxic training, when you force your body to perform even when ample oxygen isn\u2019t available. They also use it for cardio endurance training.</p>\n<p>Naturally, I had to try it. Accompanied by surf photographer <a href=\"https://www.zaknoyle.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Zak Noyle</a>, I grabbed a face mask and made my way into the ocean at Makapu\u2019u Beach. The waves were no joke \u2014 getting past the break proved to be even harder than we thought \u2014 and this was sans surfboard.</p>\n<p><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">Related:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/guy-wisdom/secluded-beaches\">The Best Secluded Beaches</a></p>\n<p>Before I went down, Noyle explained how it would work. Surf videographer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ryan.moss/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Ryan Moss</a>, who came out to help, would go down to the ocean floor with me and hand me the 50-or-so-pound rock. I was to take it, hug it in tight to my body, and then start to move with it. Sounds easy right? Not quite. Despite the fact that you\u2019re in water, that rock is still heavy. When I didn\u2019t hug it into my chest as instructed, it overpowered me, pulling me to my knees before I even knew it.</p>\n<p>Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<p>After a couple of attempts that ended with the rock pulling me down to my knees, I slowed down, pulled the rock in tight, and sprinted forward as long as I could before dropping the rock and kicking off the ocean floor to shoot back up to the surface. By sprinted forward, I really mean ran in slow motion; the resistance from the water on all sides doesn\u2019t really allow for sprinting, but it does force you to use all the muscles in your legs to remain standing and move forward.</p>\n<p>Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<p><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">Related:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/guy-wisdom/american-adventurer-bucket-list-activities\">10 Bucket List Activities for the Great American Adventurer</a></p>\n<h2>Next up, surfing.</h2>\n<p>I signed up for a lesson at Hans Hedemann Surf School located in the Turtle Bay Resort. My two instructors explained the steps I\u2019d learn on land and then take out to the waves. I began by lying on the board, feet almost touching the end, chest over the middle, arms out to the side, paddling. When a good wave would come, my instructors would say paddle, and I was to take off as fast as I could using my arms. The next cue would be \u201cpop up,\u201d which told me to grab the sides of the board and use my arms to pop up onto my feet, then immediately jump into a sideways split stance. Once on the board, the goal was to stay low, similar to a squat position, without completely stiffening in the legs. The more precise yet malleable I could be, the better chance I had of staying on the board. Got it? Great. Now it was time to paddle out.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1018\" width=\"1600\" data-delta=\"3\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/inline-3-surfing-in-hawaii-school.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<p>While waiting to get up, I learned that you always face the waves. The ocean is the boss out there, and you don\u2019t want to be taken off guard by a wave you don\u2019t see coming. When it was my turn to catch a wave, I turned the board around the face the shore \u2014 which is only okay once you're ready to surf \u2014 and waited for the instructor's directions. When I finally popped up, I managed to stay low \u2014 though I could have gotten even lower \u2014 and land both feet on the board. Just like that, I was surfing!</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1018\" width=\"1600\" data-delta=\"4\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/inline-4-surfing-in-hawaii-school.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<p>The timing of the pop-up was harder than the balancing aspect. If I ever went too early or too late, or if my feet landed too far back on the board, a nosedive soon followed and I ended up in the ocean. I was grateful the water was shallow and there wasn't any reef to crash into. All that falling didn't mean any injury to the body \u2014 just the ego.</p>\n<p>I got up a handful of times before I was ready to call it quits. Surfing takes a lot out of you \u2014 I wore my <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/guy-wisdom/everything-we-love-about-apple-watch\">Apple Watch</a> the whole time, and I burned almost 400 calories in 45 minutes. I was tired, but so glad I said yes to this adventure.</p>]]></description>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Why Your Deodorant Might Be Making You Flabby, Tired, and Impotent</title>\n      <link>https://www.menshealth.com/health/deodorant-health-risks-fragrance-chemicals-phthalates-styrene</link>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">3030926</guid>\n<pubDate>Fri, 09 Feb 2018 16:07:46 +0000</pubDate>\n<dcterms:modified>2018-02-10T13:33:09+00:00</dcterms:modified>\n<dc:creator>Markham Heid</dc:creator>\n      <description><![CDATA[\n<img src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/deodorant-make-flabby-tired-impotent.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" alt=\"\u200bWhy Your Deodorant Might Be Making You Flabby, Tired, and Impotent\" />\n<span class=\"copyright\">Image by Getty  </span>\n<p>Chemicals in scented products like deodorant, shampoo, and cologne have been linked to a wide range of health risks. The scariest part? We don't know just how many there are</p>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/style/best-shampoo-for-hair-type\">shampoo</a> to soap to deodorant to hair wax, most products these days are heavily scented. In fact, you may be piling on half a dozen or more fragranced grooming products when you get ready for work (and that's not even counting actual fragranced products like cologne). Even your detergent, dryer sheets, air freshener, and countertop cleaner are likely scented.</p>\n<p>That's a problem, according to some experts who are sounding the alarm about the potential health risks associated with the chemicals.</p>\n<p>What kinds of health risks? \u201cBreathing difficulties, asthma attacks, migraine headaches, dizziness, rashes, congestion, seizures, nausea, and a range of other physical problems,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.drsteinemann.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Anne Steinemann, Ph.D.</a>, a professor of civil engineering at Australia\u2019s University of Melbourne who has conducted <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11869-016-0442-z\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> on long-term exposure to fragranced consumer products. In a 2017 study, Steinemann even found that 33% of Australians reported experiencing migraines and asthma attacks after exposure to fragranced products like air fresheners and cleaning supplies.</p>\n<p>While this might sound extreme, Steinemann is far from the only researcher to express concern about chemicasls in fragranced products. A handful of studies have found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/feb/10/phthalates-plastics-chemicals-research-analysis\" target=\"_blank\">phthalates</a>, a class of chemicals that are often used in scented soaps and shampoos, can also have some harrowing effects, says <a href=\"https://bio.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/hbpatisa/\" target=\"_blank\">Heather Patisaul</a>, Ph.D., a professor of biological sciences at North Carolina State University who runs a lab studying the biological effects of consumer chemicals.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese compounds have been linked to abnormalities of <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/phthalates-dehp-chemical-in-plastics-boys-future-fertility/\" target=\"_blank\">male reproductive system development</a> and are suspected of having neuro-developmental effects,\" she says.</p>\n<p>Patisaul says that aside from phthalates, other fragrance chemicals have been shown to block testosterone activity, which could lead to loss of energy, <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/protect-your-erection\">erectile dysfunction</a>, or problems building or maintaining muscle (<a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/low-testosterone-treatment\">to name just a few concerns associated with low testosterone</a>).</p>\n<p><em>4 Things Most Guys Get Wrong About Skin Cancer:</em></p>\n \n <media:content url=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/brightcove-proxy/video/4943914614001/file.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n<p>What's even more frightening is that in 2014, the U.S. National Toxicology Program issued <a href=\"https://www.nap.edu/catalog/18725/review-of-the-styrene-assessment-in-the-national-toxicology-program-12th-report-on-carcinogens\" target=\"_blank\">a report</a> about styrene, a chemical found in a range of consumer goods, including <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/enviroblog/2014/08/expert-panel-confirms-fragrance-ingredient-can-cause-cancer#.WnyIeZPwZ-U\" target=\"_blank\">fragranced personal care and household products</a>. The NTP said that it found \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d that styrene can cause cancer in humans. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3165940/\" target=\"_blank\">Research</a> in animals has linked styrene to lung, breast, stomach, and liver cancers.</p>\n<p>\u201cStyrene is important to know about, but there are potentially hundreds of other fragrance chemicals that may be carcinogenic,\u201d says <a href=\"https://silentspring.org/staff/robin-dodson-scd\" target=\"_blank\">Robin Dodson</a>, Sc.D., a research scientist at the nonprofit environmental research organization the Silent Spring Institute. \u201cWe don\u2019t know about the others, because they haven\u2019t been tested.\u201d</p>\n<p>While most of us assume the products we buy at our local CVS or Walmart have been rigorously tested to ensure their safety, the truth is that's not quite the case. <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/02/toxic-chemicals-fragrance-cosmetics-safety/\" target=\"_blank\">The Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) does not require cosmetic manufacturers to prove in advance that all of their ingredients are safe. Instead, there must be proof that an ingredient causes harm for a product to be yanked from the shelves.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FDA and EPA are not testing these products for safety,\u201d says Dodson.</p>\n<p>For its part, the FDA addresses the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductsIngredients/Ingredients/ucm128250.htm\" target=\"_blank\">potential health risks of chemicals like phthalates</a> on its website, stating that after conducting multiple studies and reviewing the available data, the agency was unable to find \"a sound, scientific basis to support taking regulatory action against cosmetics containing phthalates. (<em>Men's Health</em> has reached out to the FDA, and we will update if we hear back.)</p>\n<p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/style/does-my-deodorant-work\">Is Your Deodorant Actually Working?</a></p>\n<p>To make matters worse, companies that produce scented products are not even required to disclose all of the ingredients they use to begin with. That's in part due to a loophole in the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/ucm414211.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Fair Packaging and Labeling Act</a>, which states that companies do not have to reveal an ingredient <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/LawsEnforcedbyFDA/ucm148722.htm\" target=\"_blank\">if it qualifies as a \"trade secret</a>.\"</p>\n<p>That explains why, if you look at the list of ingredients on your canister of hair product or bottle of countertop cleaner, you might see a long list of multisyllabic chemicals, along with the word \u201cfragrance\u201d or \u201cparfum.\u201d That single, seemingly benign word could be a stand-in for dozens or even hundreds of chemicals, Patisaul says.</p>\n<p>\u201cLiterally thousands of chemicals can be described under the generic term \u2018fragrance,\u2019 but for each scented product you buy, it is impossible to know what chemicals are included,\u201d Patisaul says.</p>\n<p>That said, there are ways to find out what ingredients are being used in your scented products. In 2010, following a campaign by consumer watchdogs, a trade group known as the <a href=\"http://www.ifraorg.org/\" target=\"_blank\">International Fragrance Association</a> started publishing a \u201ctransparency list\u201d of all the ingredients that manufacturers could include in their scented products under umbrella terms like \u201cfragrance.\u201d <a href=\"http://www.ifraorg.org/en-us/ingredients#.Wl9rs5M-fVo\" target=\"_blank\">That list</a> includes roughly 4,000 organic and synthetic compounds \u2014 some of which, like styrene, have been linked to cancer. The non-profit Environmental Working Group\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/#.Wl9wK5M-fVo\" target=\"_blank\">Skin Deep Database</a> also provides health and safety info on thousands of consumer chemicals.)</p>\n<p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/fragrances-make-you-sick\">Why Strong Perfume Makes You Physically Ill</a></p>\n<p>So is there anything else you can do to lower your risks? First, the obvious: you should avoid buying fragranced products whenever possible. \u201cBuying unscented products is an effective step for reducing chemical exposures,\u201d Patisaul says.</p>\n<p>While that includes cologne, you don\u2019t necessarily have to ditch your favorite eau or aftershave. At the very least, you can stop using the dozen other scented products you spread, lather, or rub on your body every day in favor of fragrance-free alternatives. Just use a single scented product\u2014be it cologne, aftershave, or hair product.</p>\n<p>You should also stop buying scented laundry detergent, air freshener, household cleaner, and other fragranced products that don\u2019t need to smell nice to do their jobs. \u201cNone of us needs fragranced trash bags,\u201d Dodson says. \u201cWe can all skip those.\u201d She also adds that if you see the term \u201cunscented\u201d on a label, that could just mean that masking agents have been added to cover up any chemical odors. Instead, buy products that are labeled \u201cfragrance free.\u201d</p>\n<p>You should also buy product that prioritize product transparency, Dodson says. If you see every specific ingredient listed on the label, and the manufacturer makes a point of highlighting the lack of phthalates and <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/should-people-be-concerned-about-parabens-in-beauty-products/\" target=\"_blank\">parabens</a>, that\u2019s a good sign.</p>\n<p>Finally, Patisaul says we all need to be pushing lawmakers and government officials to change the way these products are regulated. \u201cThe overarching problem is that the FDA lacks the authority to require manufacturers to test personal care products for safety,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, we simply don't know a lot about the chemicals being used in our products, let alone the extent of the threat they might pose to our health and safety. But until we get serious about educating ourselves and pushing for more transparency from manufacturers, nothing will change.</p>]]></description>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Why You Should Never Pop That Red, Tender Bump Near Your Eye</title>\n      <link>https://www.menshealth.com/health/eye-stye-treatment</link>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">3030891</guid>\n<pubDate>Fri, 09 Feb 2018 14:45:02 +0000</pubDate>\n<dcterms:modified>2018-02-10T13:33:28+00:00</dcterms:modified>\n<dc:creator>Suzannah Weiss</dc:creator>\n      <description><![CDATA[\n<img src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/never-pop-red-bump-near-eye.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" alt=\"\u200bWhy You Should Never Pop That Red, Tender Bump Near Your Eye\" />\n<span class=\"copyright\">Image by Getty  </span>\n<p>Eye styes look like a zit, but you need to keep your hands off</p>\n<p>There are all sorts of bumps that can pop up on your face: Everything from zits on your chin to <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/cold-sore-treatment\">cold sores on your lips</a>, there's no shortage of lesions that can take up residence on your mug.</p>\n<p>But few are as disconcerting or as annoying as the eye stye, which are tender, red bumps that grow on your eyelids. They <em>could</em> look like zits, but as tempting as they may be to pop, you need to resist the urge.</p>\n<p>Here, everything you need to know about the red, painful bumps that occur on your eyelids.</p>\n<h2>What is an eye stye?</h2>\n<p>Eye styes aren\u2019t serious, but they should be treated promptly.</p>\n<p>Eye styes can spring up when bacteria gets into your eyelids\u2019 meibomian glands, which play a role in eye lubrication. This bacteria often comes from your eyelashes, especially if you\u2019re experiencing a buildup of eyelash bacteria known as blepharitis, which causes a crusty buildup at their base, says ophthalmologist and laser eye surgeon Ming Wang, M.D., Ph.D.</p>\n<p>The telltale sign of an eye stye is a bump along your eyelid, says Dr. Wang. In the beginning, it will likely be red or painful to touch. Over time, it may become less sensitive, less red, and firmer. They usually occur on the outside of your eyelid, or on the bottom portion.</p>\n<p>Eye styes don\u2019t usually affect your eyesight, though in some cases, they could cause astigmatism, which may blur your vision, says Dr. Wang. They could also lead your eyelid to droop, blocking your vision. Both these issues will go away once the eye stye does.</p>\n<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/7-reasons-eyes-are-blurry\">7 Reasons Your Eyesight Is Blurry</a></p>\n<h2>How to get rid of eye styes</h2>\n<p>If you think you might have an eye stye, see a doctor. They\u2019ll likely prescribe oral antibiotics, though prescription eye drops sometimes also work, says Dr. Wang. To avoid getting reinfected, complete this treatment even if the eye stye resolves.</p>\n<p>As the infection\u2019s clearing up, you can minimize the pain and speed up the healing process by holding a warm compress like the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N303YPU/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=menshealth06-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B01N303YPU&amp;ascsubtag=%5BASIN%7CB01N303YPU%5Bnid%7C2378331%5Bvid%7C2601606%5Bbrand%7CMH%5Butm%7C\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">BRUDER Moist Heat Eye Compress</a>&nbsp;on your eye for five minutes up to five times a day, says Dr. Wang. You can also make your own compress by soaking a washcloth in warm water or microwaving a sock filled with uncooked rice. The moist warmth can help encourage the infection to drain.</p>\n<p>In rare cases when these methods don\u2019t work, a doctor can remove the growth through an injection or surgery.</p>\n<p>Whatever you do, don\u2019t pop it\u2014and we really mean that. Popping an eye stye has the potential to be riskier than popping a zit. That's because the infection might spread to other parts of your eyelid or create cuts or abrasions in your skin, which give opening for other infections to enter, says Dr. Wang. It could even spread to your eye itself or, in rare cases, your brain, which can be fatal.</p>\n<p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/worst-things-you-do-to-eyes\">The 8 Worst Things You Can Do to Your Eyes</a></p>\n<h2>How to prevent eye styes</h2>\n<p>When you wash your face, Dr. Wang recommends gently going over your eyelids with warm water and mild soap, baby shampoo, or an eyelid cleanser like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000US084U/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=menshealth06-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000US084U&amp;ascsubtag=%5BASIN%7CB000US084U%5Bnid%7C2378331%5Bvid%7C2601606%5Bbrand%7CMH%5Butm%7C\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Ocusoft Lid Scrub</a>&nbsp;once a day. This will help make sure the follicles are kept clear and not clogging up.</p>\n<p>Eye styes themselves are rarely contagious, he adds.

Check out these <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/how-to-talk-dirty-like-a-porn-star\">dirty talk tips from porn stars</a>.)</p>\n<p>Dirty talk isn't just liberating, it's also a great way to amp up the conversation about consent. \u201cSaying what feels good to you as it\u2019s happening will lead to comfort with asking for more of it. \u2018Your hand feels great there,\u2019 or \u2018I love the way you look in that position\u2019 can be all you need to get the ball rolling. Pay attention to how your partner reacts, and gradually ramp things up,\u201d Morse advises.</p>\n<h2>2) Going to a strip club</h2>\n<p>Yup, you read that right: nearly 70% of women said they were interested in going to a strip club with their partner. It's not because she loves the wings at the buffet: strip clubs have a unique and intense sexual energy, so if you and your partner are up for it, going together can make for a hot date night.</p>\n<p>\u201cFora lotof couples, hitting a strip club is kind of like a safe way to explore a <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/negotiate-a-threesome\">threesome</a> without all the hassle. The taboo of watching your partner\u2014or having them watch you\u2014being teased by a stranger can be great foreplay,\u201d says Morse.</p>\n<h2>3) Using a remote-controlled sex toy</h2>\n<p>63% of women said they fantasized about using remote-controlled <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/sex-toys-for-couples\">sex toys</a>, while 44% said they wanted their partners to operate remote-controlled sex toys in public. The thrill of helping her get off without anyone knowing gives you both a dirty little secret to share. \"Giving a partner control over your pleasure is incredibly stimulating,\" says Morse.</p>\n<p>Products like the <a href=\"http://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1093213&amp;u=1304286&amp;m=65394&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">JIVE by We-Vibe</a> ($119) allow you to control a wearable vibrator via a smartphone app. Helping her get off without anyone else knowing gives you both a dirty little secret to share.\"The risk that you might be caught doing something sexual in your everyday environment is a classic turn-on, and it\u2019s heightened by the anticipation that comes with leaving your sexual fate in someone else\u2019s hands,\u201d Morse says. Just be careful not to use it while she's on a conference call.</p>\n<h2>4) Being blindfolded</h2>\n<p>58% of women said they fantasized about being blindfolded during sex. \u201cBesides the sexiness of trust and dominance, being blindfolded amplifies everything else,\u201d says Morse. \u201cAll of a sudden, unexpected touches and kisses create waves of pleasure that can turbo-charge arousal. And the anticipation of what\u2019s coming next can be enough to drive you over the edge.\"Just be sure to check in with her periodically and make sure she's comfortable with what you're doing.</p>]]></description>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>This Man Came Down With the Flu\u2014 and It&#039;s Going to Cost Him His Fingers and Toes</title>\n      <link>https://www.menshealth.com/health/man-to-lose-fingers-and-toes-flu-complications</link>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">3030216</guid>\n<pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2018 20:56:25 +0000</pubDate>\n<dcterms:modified>2018-02-09T13:34:00+00:00</dcterms:modified>\n<dc:creator>Reegan von Wildenradt</dc:creator>\n      <description><![CDATA[\n<img src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/man-lose-fingers-from-flu.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" alt=\"This Man Came Down With the Flu\u2014and It&#039;s Going to Cost Him His Fingers and Toes\" />\n<span class=\"copyright\">Image by WFAA-TV</span>\n<p>How common is this scary flu complication?

He said he started to feel sick and dizzy while at work, so he decided to go home. Days later, on December 29, he was feeling bad enough that he went to the doctor.</p>\n<p>\"I got there at 12 a.m., and by 3 a.m., they were telling me I only had 24 hours to live,\" Smith told WFAA.</p>\n<p>Smith had developed an extremely dangerous complication from the <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/adenovirus-symptoms-mimic-flu\">flu</a> \u2014 sepsis and pneumonia. Sepsis can cause organs to shut down in the body, and that's exactly what was happening to Smith.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/sepsis-death\">Sepsis</a> can be fatal if not treated quickly enough, regardless of gender, age or health. <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/guy-wisdom/21-year-old-bodybuilder-dies-septic-shock-influenza\">A 21-year-old bodybuilder recently died from sepsis</a> that developed from the flu. Fortunately for Smith, doctors were able to save his life, but his fingers and toes are a different story.</p>\n<p>Smith told WFAA that while he was in the hospital being treated for kidney failure, pneumonia and sepsis, doctors gave him drugs to help with his <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/lower-blood-pressure-without-medication\">blood pressure</a>. \u201cAs a result of the drugs from the high blood pressure that they gave me, it left me with compromised limbs,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Now most of his fingers are black and blue, his hands surrounded by bandages.</p>\n<p>While he can\u2019t speak to this particular case, Daniel P. Eiras, MD, MPH, assistant professor, Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases &amp; Immunology at NYU Langone Health, explained that although very rare, it\u2019s entirely possible for the flu to cause these effects.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you get the flu, your body\u2019s immune system is fighting off a severe infection,\u201d Eiras told <em>Men\u2019s Health.</em> \u201cYour blood pressure drops, and it makes it difficult for your body to get blood to places like certain organs and the tips of your fingers and toes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eiras explained that this loss of blood can cause necrosis, which is essentially the dying of tissue. \u201cThis would cause the limbs to become gangrenous, which is why an amputation would have to happen,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Developing sepsis from flu complications is rare, especially for people outside of the vulnerable populations (the elderly and the very young). It\u2019s even more rare for sepsis to lead to necrosing limbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/flu-myths\">Read these flu myths you must stop believing</a></p>\n<p>In the event that you do get the flu, there are steps you can take to make sure it doesn't become something worse.</p>\n<p>\u201cCold and flu symptoms can be very similar, especially in the beginning,\u201d Eiras said. \u201cIf you feel something come on and you think it might be the flu, go into your doctor and get tested. If you have the flu, there are medications your doctor can give you.\u201d These medications are more effective in earlier stages, so the sooner you go in, the better.</p>\n<p>As far as <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/can-grape-juice-prevent-norovirus-stomach-flu\">preventing yourself from getting the flu</a> in the first place, Erias said there\u2019s one thing everyone must do. \u201cGet your flu shot. If you\u2019re over 6 months in age, you should have your flu shot,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t gotten it yet, it\u2019s not too late. Go get it. It could save lives.\u201d</p>\n<p>Smith told WFAA that he'd gotten his flu shot, but still got the flu. However, that isn\u2019t an excuse to not get one.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a chance you could still get the flu even if you get your flu shot,\u201d Eiras said, \u201cBut getting the shot is still the best preventative measure you can take.\u201d</p>\n<p>Besides getting your flu shot, there are everyday habits you should be doing to lower your chances of getting the flu. \u201cMake sure you do things like cough into your sleeve and wash your hands frequently,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t come into work if you\u2019re sick.\u201d</p>]]></description>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>These Common Sex Problems Might Be Killing Your Relationship</title>\n      <link>https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/these-common-sex-problems-might-be-killing-your-relationship</link>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">3030211</guid>\n<pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2018 20:28:58 +0000</pubDate>\n<dcterms:modified>2018-02-09T13:34:33+00:00</dcterms:modified>\n<dc:creator>Stacey Leasca</dc:creator>\n      <description><![CDATA[\n<img src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/common-problem-ruining-sex-life.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" alt=\"These Common Sex Problems Might Be Killing Your Relationship\" />\n<span class=\"copyright\">Image by Getty  </span>\n<p>eHarmony polled 2,300 people about their happiness level in their relationships, and the results are in</p>\n<p>With Valentine\u2019s Day just around the corner, you may be evaluating the state of your relationship. If you\u2019re looking for something to measure it against, look no further than the latest survey by eHarmony.</p>\n<p>The dating site released a report on Thursday called <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/64-percent-of-americans-say-theyre-happy-in-their-relationships-300595502.html\" target=\"_blank\">Happiness Index: The State of Relationships in America.</a> In it, the company asked more than 2,300 people ages 18 and up who were either married or in long-term relationships about their happiness levels with their partner.</p>\n<p>According to the survey, a whopping 64 percent of people said they are at least \u201cvery happy\u201d with their relationships. Nevertheless, there's still plenty that bugs people about their romantic situations \u2014 and just 50 percent of people said they were happy with their sex lives.</p>\n<p>So what's bugging people the most when it comes to romance? Stress from work is at the top of the list, with 34 percent of guys and 36 percent of women saying it has a negative impact on their relationship. Twenty-five percent of men and 29 percent of women said that arguments about money added to their relationship unhappiness.</p>\n<p>As you might have guessed, much of people's relationship problems come come from their sex lives. Twenty-eight percent of guys and 38 percent of women complained about someone being \"too tired for sex\"; 21 percent of men and 35 percent of women about <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/low-libido-causes-in-men\">low sex drive</a>; and 13 percent of men and 16 percent of women about <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/easy-ways-to-make-sex-better\">boring sex</a>.</p>\n<p>If negative factors are putting a strain on your relationship, there are ways you can fix things. According to eHarmony, the couples who reported being happiest in their relationships are the ones who have \"open communication with their partner.\" This can mean talking to each other, to a therapist, or to friends.</p>\n<p>Believe it or not, Millennials are the most effective communicators of all.</p>\n<p>\"There\u2019s this narrative about millennials being entitled,\" eHarmony CEO Grant Langston told <em>Men's Health</em>. \u201cWe see them as most interested in communication of any of the age groups, and male Millennials are driving the difference.\u201d Langston added that Millennial guys are more willing to talk to friends, family, and therapists about their relationships than any other age demographic.</p>\n<p>Another key to happiness? Don\u2019t rush into getting married. As the survey showed, couples who were over the age of 30 and dated for five years before taking the plunge reported being far happier than those who didn\u2019t wait.</p>\n<p>If you're looking to spice up your relationship, it could be as easy as making new couple friends and <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/how-to-spice-up-your-marriage\">enjoying date nights out together</a> more often.

One reason? Your body constantly feels hungry, according to a new <a href=\"http://www.physiology.org/doi/10.1152/ajpendo.00322.2017\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> from the American Physiological Society.</p>\n<p>For the study, researchers had 40 obese volunteers \u2014 which was defined as having a body mass index greater than 40 \u2014 attend five three-week long weight loss sessions over the span of two years. During the sessions, the participants were coached through daily exercise and eating healthy.</p>\n<p>The researchers did a blood test to measure their hunger and satiety hormone levels after four weeks, one year, and two years into the experiment. They also recorded the participants\u2019 self-reported feelings of hunger and fullness during these times.</p>\n<p>All of the participants lost weight \u2014 but even though they were able to keep most of it off after two years, they felt hungry: At the one and two-year periods, the researchers discovered that their feelings of fullness dipped, while feelings of hunger significantly spiked.</p>\n<p>It might be an evolutionary reaction: When you lose a lot of weight, your body sees it as a threat to your survival, so it boosts your hunger hormones to signal that you need to eat. However, the patients in the study saw an increase in <em>oth</em> their hunger and satiety hormones. Yet, the hunger hormones seemed to override the ones associated with fullness.</p>\n<p>And that ravenous I-need-more-food feeling is a huge problem when you\u2019re trying to maintain weight loss.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis study shows what is known in the obesity clinical setting. Most people will fail diet and exercise programs for weight loss,\u201d explains obesity specialist <a href=\"http://drspencer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Spencer Nadolsky</a>, D.O., author of <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1518824226/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=menshealth06-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1518824226&amp;ascsubtag=%5BASIN%7C1518824226%5Bnid%7C2378311%5Bvid%7C2601536%5Bbrand%7CMH%5Butm%7C\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Fat Loss Prescription</a></em>. \u201cThere are multiple reasons for this, but <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/weight-loss/belly-off-weight-loss-secrets\">appetite</a> is one of the biggest ones.\u201d</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t mean your diet is necessarily doomed to fail: This study had the participants eat more often \u2014 five to six times a day instead of three \u2014 which could have skewed appetite and hunger ratings if they weren\u2019t used to chowing down so frequently. \u201cIt may prime them to want to eat more often,\u201d says Dr. Nadolsky.</p>\n<p>The good news is, despite their desire to eat more, the study participants did manage to keep off most of the weight they lost, says Dr. Nadolsky.</p>\n<p>Battling that appetite can be difficult for the long haul, though, especially if you\u2019re going at it alone. Here are a few things Dr. Nadolsky has his patients do when all they can think about is wanting more food:</p>\n<h2>OPTIMIZE YOUR MEALS</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/ultimate-guide-to-protein-supplements\">Protein</a> and <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/truth-about-fiber\">fiber</a> are your best friends here. Both slow down digestion, helping you feel fuller for longer. When hunger strikes, increase your protein intake by roughly 10 grams at each meal and double the amount of non-starchy vegetables on your plate.</p>\n<p>Make your fiber-packed carbs high in volume and low in calories. Foods like melon, berries, and legumes may help, says Dr. Nadolsky. \u201cTinker with how many meals per day you eat,\u201d he adds. \u201cYou may feel you do better with fewer but larger meals.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/natural-appetite-suppressant-snacks\">7 Healthy Snacks That Will Tame Your Appetite</a></p>\n<h2>DRINK PLENTY OF WATER</h2>\n<p>Glug water before and during your meals, says Dr. Nadolsky. Your stomach can only contain so much at once, so when it\u2019s partly full of water, you\u2019ll feel fuller faster and leave less room for extra food.</p>\n<p>In fact, overweight people who downed about 17 ounces of water 30 minutes before their meals for 12 weeks lost three more pounds than those who didn\u2019t, party due to the fact that water just made them feel more full, according to a <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.21167/abstract\">study</a> published in the journal <em>Obesity</em>.</p>\n<p><em>7 Foods Doctors Prescribe:&nbsp;</em></p>\n \n <media:content url=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/brightcove-proxy/video/5269486276001/file.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n<h2><strong>TALK TO YOUR DOC ABOUT MEDICATION</strong></h2>\n<p>\u201cIf these things don\u2019t work and the hunger is unbearable and weight regain is inevitable, we use <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/weight-loss/appetite-suppressants\">appetite suppressant medicines</a> to help,\u201d says Dr. Nadolsky.</p>\n<p>These drugs target receptors in your brain linked to your appetite.

What they learn during training can help you perform back here on Earth</p>\n<p>How many astronauts does it take to change a lightbulb? By the look of things on a recent morning in the NASA Neutral Buoyancy Lab at Johnson Space Center in Houston: two.</p>\n<p>Plus hundreds of support personnel, including 14 divers suspended in the water with video cameras, all manner of tech support poolside, and a cadre of coffee-sipping flight operations specialists watching on screens in a control room overlooking the scene.</p>\n<p>It's 9:11 a.m. when Col. Nick Hague, 42, encased in his 300-pound space suit, is lowered by crane into a pool that measures 202 feet long, 102 feet wide, and 40 feet deep. Submerged in it is a replica of the $75-billion-plus International Space Station, or ISS. For the next six hours, Hague and German astronaut Alexander Gerst will simulate an extravehicular activity (EVA), a.k.a. spacewalk, to perform maintenance tasks.</p>\n<p>This fall, Hague will ride a Russian rocket to the ISS and begin a six-month stint. He's one of just eight members of NASA's class of 2013, and first in the class to be assigned a mission. On this simulated spacewalk he'll adjust (not literally change) a light on the robotic arm of the $1.7 billion service system, a task that astronauts currently on the ISS will do eight days later. He'll also upgrade some batteries, a job he'll later take on in orbit. The spacewalk (a misnomer\u2014it's a hands-only climb across the station's exterior) is a physical challenge. Astronauts clench their hands thousands of times as they loosen and tighten bolts and screws, chafing fingertips, knuckles, and collarbones. It's the metabolic equivalent of running a marathon. There are no breaks; they wear diapers under their suits.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1286\" width=\"994\" data-delta=\"1\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/inline-1-see-you-on-mars-nasa.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<p>It's a painstakingly long process. Every move seems to be in slow motion, and every action is called out over the radio. Astronauts have major constraints on the speed of their movements due to the pressure in the suits, as well as the amount of force they can place on the structure. It's laborious yet intricate work, akin to doing mechanical surgery while wearing oven mitts and floating upside down. And an EVA requires sustained focus, says instructor Grier Wilt, NASA's EVA flight controller. \"You're handling critical hardware with a unique set of tools and equipment while maneuvering in microgravity under the extreme conditions of space.\" If you look down, you see Earth 250 miles below, sliding by at 17,500 miles an hour. Every 45 minutes the sun rises or sets, blasting you with light or pitching you into darkness.</p>\n<p>Rehearsals like this one in the pool allow flight controllers to assess hand and foot placements, tether locations, tool selection, and overall task choreography. Afterward there's a debriefing. \"We were able to successfully evaluate the body positioning and orientation for working on the robotic arm,\" says Hague. \"It was a short-notice task that was added to support a planned spacewalk. This checkout of procedures and techniques helped make the EVA a success.\" Astronauts typically do nine spacewalks during initial training and another nine after they're assigned a mission. This was Hague's sixth of the final nine. \"The aim is to constantly learn, improve, and be more efficient,\" says Wilt.</p>\n<p>That's NASA's philosophy, encapsulated: constant learning. As Tom Wolfe notes in The Right Stuff, a career in flying is an infinite series of tests, like climbing a ziggurat\u2014an extraordinarily high, steep Babylonian pyramid. Simply surviving the vetting process for the program is arduous. Hague was one of four men and four women chosen from 6,113 applicants in 2013. (The 2017 class drew 18,353 applicants for 12 spots. Selections are made roughly every four years.)</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1553\" width=\"1200\" data-delta=\"2\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/inline-2-see-you-on-mars-nasa.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<p>A NASA committee picks about 120 candidates who endure a week of interviews and mental and physical tests. Then that group is whittled down to 40 to 60, who must ace more interviews, excel in team-building exercises, and pass additional medical tests. These are the fastest of the fast learners. The chosen ones then embark on a two-year training program that encompasses everything from flight training to space station operations to rodent dissections. (Typically, 250 experiments are active on the space station at any given time.) There are also extreme survival courses\u2014both civilian wilderness programs and military training for crash landings. And you need to learn Russian.</p>\n<p>After graduating, trainees wait one to seven years before being assigned a mission. The right stuff still demands the moxie, reflexes, and coolness of earlier years, but now it also embraces softer skills. It's about \"space travel resource management,\" says Kathryn Bolt, NASA's chief training officer. \"How do you work in a team? How do you take care of others and yourself? How do you communicate? How do you listen?\" Meet the new breed of space explorers who may one day go to Mars.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1430\" width=\"1106\" data-delta=\"3\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/inline-3-see-you-on-mars-nasa.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<h2>COL. NICK HAGUE</h2>\n<p><em>Motto: \"Be part of something larger than yourself and never give up.\"</em></p>\n<p>At first blush, Air Force Col. Nick Hague seems like the prototypical astronaut. Ever since he was \"real little,\" growing up in Hoxie, Kansas, he gazed at the stars and dreamed of going up there. In the military, he worked his way up to test pilot and flew the F-16, F-15, and other stray cats and dogs. \"You go out and see if the plane is controllable or if it falls out of the sky,\" he says. \"It's interesting work.\" He's also a graduate of MIT, where he studied aeronautical engineering and built spacecraft components. \"Grad school taught me how to handle complicated concepts and models,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Hague applied to NASA in 2003 and 2009 before finally gaining acceptance in 2013. Those initial failures only inspired him to strive harder. \"You can't guess what the selection committee finds most valuable,\" he says. \"The process is to be yourself: I followed my passion and found success in my career. That brought opportunities.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Embrace Fear</strong></p>\n<p>\"When I'm scrunched up in the Soyuz on the launchpad in Baikonur in September, I know my heart rate and blood pressure will be elevated,\" Hague says. \"I'm expecting it.\" Jangled nerves are normal when you're perched on a rocket atop tens of thousands of gallons of kerosene and liquid oxygen fuel about to blast off and hit 1,200 miles per hour in 70 seconds. Embracing fear helps subdue uncertainty, explains Jim Picano, Ph.D., NASA's senior operational psychologist. Moreover, astronauts are trained to feel confident that they're prepared to handle anything that might go wrong. NASA is famous for its \"next-worst-case\" protocol for emergencies. The instructors drill worst-case and next-worst-case scenarios over and over. If something goes wrong, the astronauts have an emergency protocol and a plan to execute.</p>\n<p><strong>Strengthen Your Team</strong></p>\n<p>Success depends on everyone performing at their peak, so astronauts are trained to invest in their teammates. We picture the laconic astronaut, self-reliant and concise with his language. Sure, but the team needs more. \"It's providing opportunities for colleagues to talk,\" Hague says. \"We all have bad days. It sure helps if someone throws his arm over your shoulder and says, 'You're having a rough go. What's going on? Let's grab a drink and talk.' Or you say, 'I want to take your mind off things. Let's do something else.'\"</p>\n<p><strong>Know Your Flaws</strong></p>\n<p>Self-awareness is crucial. Hague knows he can be a hangry mess, so he keeps nuts on hand. At 6'1\", he's tall for an astronaut, so he does yoga weekly. \"On the Soyuz, I'll have my knees in my chest for three or four hours. I need to maintain flexibility.\" And he pulls strength from his wife and two young sons. \"There are moments when my boys understand what I'm doing,\" he says. \"But for the most part, I'm just the goofy, clueless guy who doesn't know anything and embarrasses them. I'm still just Dad, and that's pretty cool.\"</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1553\" width=\"1200\" data-delta=\"4\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/inline-4-see-you-on-mars-nasa.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<h2>LT.COL. ANDREW MORGAN</h2>\n<p><em>Motto: \"Always do right; this will gratify some people and astonish the rest.\" \u2014Mark Twain</em></p>\n<p>He's neither an aviator nor an engineer, and that's what makes Army Lt. Col. Andrew Morgan, M.D., 42, unlike many astronaut candidates. But that didn't stop the New Castle, Pennsylvania, native from gaining acceptance to NASA on his first attempt.</p>\n<p>Morgan graduated from West Point and earned a doctorate in medicine from the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. In a 19-year military career, he served as a physician with special forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and completed such elite courses as Special Forces Assessment and Selection, Ranger School, Combat Diver training, and Military Freefall Parachutist school. \"Being a bit different made me stand out. My special skills are medicine and having experience working in small, high-functioning teams in extreme environments.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Seek New Experiences</strong></p>\n<p>As part of his NASA training, Morgan had to learn to fly a plane solo. That meant attending Navy flight school with kids in their 20s fresh out of college. \"It was intense: Being alone in an aircraft for the first time is intimidating,\" he says. \"With the absence of human voices, I heard engine and cockpit noises I'd never heard and knew the inputs were all my own.\"</p>\n<p>NASA has always valued aviation training as an analogue for space flight\u2014it requires operating a complex machine, flawless knowledge of emergency protocols, and crew coordination in situations when error can mean death. Find your version of flight school\u2014forge resilience by challenging yourself to learn something new with a cohort of younger, fitter people.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn to Prioritize</strong></p>\n<p>Serving with Rangers and Green Berets in training and combat, Morgan realized that effective leaders care deeply about their team, and he made it a drill \"to think of others first,\" he says. \"It helps you avoid falling into a trap of 'self first' and the tendency to focus on your own discomfort. And by serving others first\u2014whether it's mentoring a teammate or helping a junior staffer with a personal issue\u2014you're prioritizing the team, and that's the right thing to do. If a priority is self-serving, then your tactics are often not aligned.\"</p>\n<p>That team-first approach extends to his own family and work-life balance. \"My wife and four children support me and are extremely understanding,\" he says, \"so I'm home as often as I can be for dinner because I want to be there for their lives. \"</p>\n<p><strong>Be Smart About Checklists</strong></p>\n<p>Morgan speaks passable French and was confident he could pick up Russian. And he did. But he found some of the technical material for the space station's systems harder to digest, though it was in English.</p>\n<p>\"You need more than a user's-guide understanding. You need to know how to fix something,\" he says. The discipline of following checklists was ingrained in him from his parachuting and pilot training, so he came to appreciate NASA's use of checklists to prevent user error in complex procedures.</p>\n<p>And not-so-complex ones, back home with the most important team of all. \"When my family vacates the house for a week, I run the checklist,\" he says. \"It adds a structure and formality to completing a task. And we remember to turn on the alarm.\"</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1601\" width=\"1200\" data-delta=\"5\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/inline-5-see-you-on-mars-nasa.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<h2>LT. CDR. JOSH CASSADA</h2>\n<p><em>Motto: \"The good thing about science is that it's true, whether or not you believe in it.\" \u2014Neil deGrasse Tyson</em></p>\n<p>Astronauts typically don't become untethered from the space station during a spacewalk, but if it happened, he or she would know how to handle it, thanks to a virtual reality simulation. In a small room at the Johnson Space Center, Navy Lt. Cdr. Josh Cassada, Ph.D., 44, is wearing a new Oculus Rift VR headset and toggling a joystick to control his jetpack thrusters. Within 20 seconds of being cast off, he's safely back to the station. All astronauts routinely do this test, even in orbit. Cassada, who hails from White Bear Lake, Minnesota, grew up blasting moon shots on the diamond.</p>\n<p>\"My first love was baseball,\" he says. \"Next it was science and aviation.\" At 26, Cassada earned a physics Ph.D. from the University of Rochester\u2014with five weeks to spare before the Navy's mandatory age cutoff for pilots. He flew missions over Iraq and later became an instructor at the Navy's test pilot school. NASA rejected him once, but he continued to serve as a Navy test pilot and was eventually accepted into the program.</p>\n<p><strong>Take Stuff Apart</strong></p>\n<p>Growing up, Cassada learned a lesson that turned out to be pretty useful: If something breaks, you fix it. \"It was partly because I was broke,\" he says. Still, he enjoyed discovering how things work. \"With YouTube and a soldering iron, I could conquer the world,\" he jokes. \"If the lawn mower hits a root, you've just got to get in there and fix the flywheel that sheared off\u2014concepts you may not be familiar with,\" he says, speaking from experience. \"When you disassemble something in your living room, you'd better know how to put it back together.\"</p>\n<p>Fixing things is core to the astronauts' mission. For the earthbound, it can hone resilience and self-confidence.</p>\n<p><strong>Get It Right</strong></p>\n<p>In grad school, Cassada did more elaborate experiments, studying quarks and collaborating with scientists from 40 universities. \"I learned to build an argument and then defend it,\" he says. \"There's nothing physicists love more than pointing out flaws in someone's analysis. It's not about being argumentative. It's about the need to get it right.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Respect the Hardware</strong></p>\n<p>In the Navy, Cassada flight-tested P-3 and P-8 planes. \"Ideally, nothing in a flight test should be exciting,\" he says. \"You collaborate with a team of engineers, mechanics, and programmers, sometimes for years for a one-hour flight. You work really hard to come up with a plan to identify risk and minimize it. Still, if it's the first time you're flying a new vehicle and you don't feel scared, then you're not doing it right.\"</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1553\" width=\"1200\" data-delta=\"6\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/inline-6-see-you-on-mars-nasa.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<h2>CDR. VICTOR GLOVER</h2>\n<p><em>Motto: \"The reward of a thing well done is to have done it.\" \u2014Ralph Waldo Emerson</em></p>\n<p>There's a regular gym for astronauts at Johnson Space Center. But there's also another gym featuring the equipment modified for zero gravity that they'll eventually use on the space station: a treadmill, spin bike, and exercise rack with a flywheel and pistons along with barbells and cables.</p>\n<p>Navy Cdr. Victor Glover, 41, is doing a modified workout, performing deadlifts, squats, and sprint intervals. Glover jokes that in zero G, he worries that his sweat droplets will float all over the space station. An F/A-18 fighter pilot and graduate of the Air Force Test Pilot School and California Polytechnic State University, Glover grew up wanting to fly the space shuttle. The 1986 Challenger explosion didn't deter him. \"We all watched it at school,\" he says. \"I realized space exploration was a big deal\u2014something important.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Train Efficiently</strong></p>\n<p>NASA's strength and conditioning specialist, Mark Guilliams, C.S.C.S., has been designing workouts for astronauts for 20 years. On the ISS they train daily to maintain strength, bone density, and cardio fitness. In just six months of zero gravity, astronauts can lose up to 20 percent of their lower-body strength. So Guilliams emphasizes variations of the deadlift and squat, total-body lifts that target areas that rapidly waste away in space. The astronauts also do interval sprints (100, 200, 400, and 800 meters) and steady-state cardio both on the treadmill and on a bike that has no handlebars\u2014a core-stability challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Know Your Role</strong></p>\n<p>With nearly 20 years of flying experience, the debrief is second nature to Glover. But at NASA he's learned to listen even better. \"By magnifying and analyzing your missteps, you learn faster,\" he says. At a meeting, for instance, be aware of priorities; ask yourself if what you plan to say will add value. Glover says survival training taught him role flexibility, to know when to lead and when to support. At a course with the National Outdoor Leadership School in Colorado, the astronauts were empowered to make decisions; everyone had a role to play, bringing clarity to the mission.</p>\n<p><strong>Overcome Loneliness</strong></p>\n<p>Military deployment includes rituals like writing your will and letters to be opened by loved ones if you're killed. Glover has done that, and he's landed an F/A-18 in the dark on an aircraft carrier. So he's ready for the risks of space travel. It helps that he's committed to spending time with his wife and four girls and is usually in bed by 9 p.m. NASA sends care packages to astronauts in orbit and allows calls and family video chats. Daily fitness training boosts well-being and reduces stress. On future expeditions\u2014such as to Mars\u2014real-time communication won't be possible, so NASA is working on solutions, such as virtual reality role-playing and time-release care packages.</p>]]></description>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>How Elite Military Trainers Create Strength Programs</title>\n      <link>https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/best-military-workouts-fitness-survival-tactics</link>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">3030121</guid>\n<pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2018 17:19:24 +0000</pubDate>\n<dcterms:modified>2018-02-09T13:34:06+00:00</dcterms:modified>\n<dc:creator>Ebenezer Samuel</dc:creator>\n      <description><![CDATA[\n<img src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/poster-new-rules-of-tactical.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1018\" alt=\"How Elite Military Trainers Create Strength Programs\" />\n<span class=\"copyright\">Photograph by Matt Nager</span>\n<p>A Jackson, Wyoming tactical program gives you the tools you need to prepare your body for more than just lifting weights</p>\n<p>Rob Shaul doesn't judge workouts the same way you do, and he doesn't care about the size of your biceps. As a trainer, his only concern is how you perform when it counts. \"Fitness training must have a 'mission direct' impact,\" says Shaul, a U.S. Coast Guard Academy grad. It's that impact that mountain athletes and the military seek when they venture to his Mountain Tactical Institute in Jackson, Wyoming, where the population (9,577) barely outpaces the elevation (6,237 feet). They come to be schooled in functional fitness that's geared toward survival in dangerous professions. \"Training should improve mission performance,\" Shaul says. Here's how to elevate your workouts to achieve that standard.</p>\n<h2>THE BIG PICTURE: Understand what you'll need to fulfill your goals</h2>\n<p>Anyone can put together a circuit of pushups, biceps curls, and box jumps, but why? \"Random programming is lazy,\" Shaul says. Before your next workout, look at each exercise in your routine and ask how it helps you reach your goals. Ponder the ensuing workout too; each session should build toward the next one.</p>\n<h2>THE PROGRAM: Know what you don't need</h2>\n<p>\"The needs, wants, and opinions of the individual are not a concern,\" says Shaul. Nothing matters unless it makes you better at your mission. For example, maximum strength probably isn't as critical as you think. \"Too much time getting stronger takes away from work on endurance or technical practice,\" he says.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1018\" width=\"1600\" data-delta=\"1\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/inline-1-new-rules-of-tactical.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<h2>THE EXERCISES: Don't overcomplicate</h2>\n<p>Instagram has tons of fancy exercise variations. Ignore them and stick to simple moves like the burpee: From a standing position, squat and place your hands on the floor; then kick back and lower your chest to the floor. Reverse and jump up. It's a full-body exercise with simple mechanics and clear benefits.</p>\n<h2>THE LOCATION: Get outside the gym</h2>\n<p>Your performance is needed in the real world, not the gym. For that, Shaul recommends moves like the sandbag getup (right) and the weighted stepup. He calls stepups \"pure drudgery\"\u2014step onto the box, step back down\u2014but they're worth it. \"There's a ton of carryover for mountain athletes,\" he says.</p>\n<h2>THE AWARENESS: Open your eyes</h2>\n<p>As important as it is to follow a routine matched to your goals, \"don't become so wedded to your program that you're blind to your deficiencies,\" Shaul says. \"All that matters is outside performance.\" If there's a movement or part of a movement that holds you back in your sport, consider varying your approach.</p>]]></description>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>You Won&#039;t See a Single Crunch In This Core Workout</title>\n      <link>https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/pushup-hollow-body-core-tabata-workout</link>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">3030081</guid>\n<pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2018 14:56:33 +0000</pubDate>\n<dcterms:modified>2018-02-09T19:12:02+00:00</dcterms:modified>\n<dc:creator>Naomi Nazario</dc:creator>\n      <description><![CDATA[\n<img src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/Gather_TABATA.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" alt=\"Anarchy Abs\" />\n<span class=\"copyright\">Image by Men's Health</span>\n<p>This Tabata from trainer Andy Speer targets even the deepest ab muscles </p>\n<p>When it comes to training your core, oftentimes simplicity is best.

But a <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/porn-themed-threats-report/20891/\" target=\"_blank\">new report by the cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab</a> shows that hackers are using a cheeky new way of spreading malware. In short, they're using porn as a trap, in the hopes that horny web-browsers will stumble into a pit of viruses with one click.</p>\n<p>Kaspersky's investigation shows that the risks are different depending on how you're browsing for porn. Macs don't get as many viruses as PCs, but users are still vulnerable to phishing and other exploits. Android phones are susceptible to sketchy applications, and PCs are always at risk of getting malware. Users on pretty much every device are in danger, but the risks are not unavoidable. To help you browse in peace and safety, here's what to watch out for.</p>\n<h2>Hackers Are Stealing Your Porn</h2>\n<p>Funnily enough, Kaspersky notes that one of the most common hacks plaguing porn browsers is theft of online porn credentials themselves. If you're a conscientious porn browser, you <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/6-reasons-men-should-pay-for-porn\">should probably be paying for at least some of your porn</a>, but there will always be a market for people who want it for free, or cheaper. Hackers will often use phishing, malware, or other ways to steal users' login info to paid porn sites like Brazzers, NaughtyAmerica, Pornhub Premium, and others, and then re-sell that info at a discount on the dark net. If you're paying for a premium account to one of those sites, be on the lookout for scams or popups that ask for your login information, and change your password frequently. Kaspersky notes that it saw more than 5,000 sales of hacked premium accounts during its research on dark net websites.</p>\n<p><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">Related:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/pays-for-porn\">Who Still Pays for Porn?</a> (If this sounds like you, you could be at risk.)</p>\n<h2>How to Recognize Phishing and Malware Scams</h2>\n<p><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">Phishing</strong> is one of the most common cyber attacks on the net. In a phishing attempt, a user is presented with a fake opportunity to voluntarily enter personal details, like emails, passwords, or credit card numbers. This can come in the form of a pop-up from a site or a fraudulent email that pretends to be from your bank, asking you to log in again. <strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">Malware</strong> is the classic \"computer virus,\" a sinister program that runs on your computer, usually without your noticing, that harms you in some way. You can get it by downloading a bad application on a computer or phone.</p>\n<p>All those flashy pop-up ads promising \"SINGLES IN YOUR AREA\" are risky clicks, because they could send you to a phishing site or trick you into downloading malware. Phishing schemes also like to pretend to be free services, like dating websites, that ask you to enter your credit card details onto the site to \"prove your identity.\"</p>\n<p>Some popups also pose as system alerts from virus software, prompting you to enter login information to \"scan your computer.\" Sometimes, they'll even give users a fake phone number to call, where a hacker will actually answer the phone and \u2014 pretending to be someone official \u2014 get you to give up your details. Kaspersky's memo notes that hackers often disguise phishing attempts as updates to Adobe Flash player, which tricks people into downloading an \"update file\" that is actually a piece of malware. Malware can do anything from use your computer as a click-bot to secretly click on a bunch of online ads, or log keyboard presses to steal important info like passwords and card numbers.</p>\n<p><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">Related:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/guy-wisdom/kovter-virus-adware-malware-pornhub\">Pornhub Was Infected With a Virus. Here's How to Tell if You Have It</a></p>\n<h2>How to Avoid Them</h2>\n<p>Phishing is pretty simple to avoid: don't click. If you do click, or if you get an email or a pop-up ad, don't enter any information. <strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">Just exit out.</strong> Don't call any phone numbers, and don't download any software updates.</p>\n<p>Stopping malware on porn sites is usually an exercise in discipline as well. Don't click the side-banner ads and pop ups, and don't agree to download any software from any website you encounter during a private-time internet session. Malware on phones can also come from apps, so don't download any app that an ad on a porn site prompts you to download. For most browsers \u2014 like Google Chrome \u2014 Flash player is built-in, so you shouldn't have to worry about updating it. If you're concerned about Flash Player, <a href=\"https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/\" target=\"_blank\">go to Adobe's official site</a> and check for an update.</p>\n<p><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">Related:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/guy-wisdom/porn-women-like-most-pornhub-2017-year-end-data\">Here's What Kind of Porn Women Like to Watch</a></p>\n<h2>Why is Porn a Target?</h2>\n<p>Kaspersky sums up why hackers are still targeting porn users: \"The difference is that, in general, victims of porn malware, especially the most severe scareware types of it, are unlikely to report the crime to anyone, because they would have to admit they were looking for or watching porn.\" If you think you've gotten a virus from porn, or anywhere else, it's not worth it to be ashamed. It happens. But you still need to address the problem.</p>\n<p>Kaspersky also offers three suggestions for staying safe: use only trusted websites; don't download applications from unknown sources; and don't buy hacked accounts to porn sites (the ones for sale on the dark net).

It happened in front of a live audience, but a video of the event was also posted online.</p>\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FN2Sreports%2Fvideos%2F1668713259903223%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n<p>Traywick told Men's Health that the purpose of the display was to \"engage and inspire the public in a novel and wholly transparent presentation of a therapy our researchers have been developing for nearly a year.\" He said he hoped the experiment would \"catalyze [the public's] engagement with similar self-experimentation using gene therapy.\"</p>\n<p>According to <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/5/16973432/biohacking-aaron-traywick-ascendance-biomedical-health-diy-gene-therapy\" target=\"_blank\">The Verge</a></em>, this bold move by Traywick isn't the first of its kind. As a <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/biohacking-care\" target=\"_blank\">biohacker</a>, Traywick reportedly has a history of encouraging self-experimentation. Last year, his biotech firm <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/this-guy-just-injected-himself-with-a-diy-hiv-treatment-1819659724\" target=\"_blank\">live-streamed a man injecting himself with a similarly untested HIV treatment</a>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe prefer to do everything before a live audience so you can hold us accountable in the days to come as we collect the data to prove whether or not this works,\u201d he said prior to the injection. \u201cIf we succeed with herpes in even the most minor ways, we can move forward immediately with cancer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ascendence, specifically, is focused on producing gene therapies to do things like reverse menopause, develop a drug that increases muscle mass and decreases fat mass, and, as Traywick demonstrated, cure <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/herpes-facts\">herpes</a>. Some biotech companies, including Ascendance, believe the current FDA approval process for drugs is too slow, so they turn to <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/dave-asprey-biohacking-tips\">biohackers</a> to both research and experiment with the drugs themselves.</p>\n<p>This, however, isn't necessarily true, says Arthur L. Caplan, PhD and founding head of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Langone Health. \"The FDA process is not slow,\" Caplan told <em>Men's Health</em>. \"If they get positive results they can move fast. Plus, the FDA permits expanded access if something looks safe and promising.\" This means that if a treatment for say, cancer, looked like it held serious promise, the FDA would expedite the process to make that available to those who need it as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Besides this, Caplan says, there's a rather large conflict of interest pertaining to this particular experiment \u2014 money. Traywick is administering a treatment on himself that his own company created. \"If they [Ascendance] own the vaccine, then their conflict of interest undermines the claim of a result,\" he said. This also directly impacts the outcome in the scenario that the drug actually works. \"Without objective independent controlled trials, few will believe their claims given their financial interest,\" Caplan said.</p>\n<p>When asked if he believes there's indeed a conflict of interest, Traywick said, \"No. We believe that the level of public spotlight and scrutiny placed upon myself and the other members of our team will actually do the opposite.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He thinks that being so public \"require[s] us to maintain a level of public transparency rarely \u2014 if ever \u2014 seen in the context of modern-day research.\"</p>\n<p>While the self-administration of unapproved drugs is on the rise, it's important to remember that there was a reason the FDA was created in the first place. Like any other business, biotech companies ultimately are looking to make money. Caplan thinks moves like Traywick's live self-injection are less about the science and more about getting publicity.</p>\n<p>\"There is a lot of interest in herpes vaccine, but it\u2019s tough to crack with fringe science by someone trying to make a profit and who lacks independent verification for any claims of a cure,\" he said, \"It looks more like showboating to hype something rather than seriously testing a vaccine.\"</p>\n<p><em>Men's Health</em> reached out to Traywick, but did not receive a response prior to publication. Traywick reportedly said that he \"felt great\" after injecting himself with the treatment. The long-term implications, however, are yet to be known.</p>\n<p><strong>Wednesday, Feb. 7, 5:08 p.m.:</strong> This story has been updated.</p>]]></description>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>How This Man Got Sober, Lost 190 Pounds, and Turned His Life Around</title>\n      <link>https://www.menshealth.com/weight-loss/noah-kingery-weight-loss-transformation</link>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">3029156</guid>\n<pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2018 17:14:18 +0000</pubDate>\n<dcterms:modified>2018-02-16T21:31:24+00:00</dcterms:modified>\n<dc:creator>Danielle Zickl</dc:creator>\n      <description><![CDATA[\n<img src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/articles/2018/02/transformation.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" alt=\"Noah Kingrey\" />\n<span class=\"copyright\">Photograph courtesy of Noah Kingery</span>\n<p>At 356 pounds, Noah Kingery didn't think he'd ever be happy\u2014until he got a wake up call that changed his life </p>\n<p>In 2007, <a href=\"http://www.nutritionmgmt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Noah Kingery</a> was playing professional youth soccer in Brazil. As an athlete, he got a crazy workout out on the field, but also spent plenty of time in the weight room and whipping up healthy meals.</p>\n<p>At 18, he was faced with a painful decision: He could either stay in Brazil and go pro or go back to his hometown of Dallas, Texas, to save his long-distance relationship. He chose his girlfriend and walked away from soccer for good.</p>\n<p>But when things didn\u2019t work out, Kingery took it <em>hard</em>. In just one year, he became 213 pounds heavier. As he found comfort in food and booze, the 143-pound athlete he knew was gone and the scale read 356 pounds \u2014 his heaviest weight ever.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was known as this high school athlete, and going from that to this, I can remember people being like, \u2018Oh my god, what happened?\u2019\u201d Kingery told <em>Men\u2019s Health</em>. \u201cI was just <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/what-depression-is-like-for-men\" target=\"_blank\">depressed</a> and spiraling into addiction.\u201d</p>\n<p>In 2009, Kingery moved to Los Angeles to start his own fashion brand, Prep Couture, which catered to celebrities like Kanye West and Justin Bieber. And while he seemed to have it all on the outside, on the inside, he was suffering. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wear anything I made,\u201d he says. \u201cI was always the man behind the scenes because I didn\u2019t actually want to be seen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Reality hit him once again just a year later after one of his closest friends was killed by a drunk driver. Kingery suddenly realized how short life could truly be.</p>\n<p>\u201cI said to myself, \u2018Okay, I\u2019ve got to stop drinking and get a handle on this. I\u2019ve got to get back to the soccer player I was in high school,\u2019\u201d he recalls.</p>\n<p>So Kingery mirrored the diet and workouts he followed when he was in shape. He swapped his daily 7,000-calorie Chinese buffet meals for simple whole foods. He stepped back into the gym and ramped up his cardio using the <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/tough-treadmill-cardio-workouts\">treadmill</a> and elliptical. He worked up to lifting again to <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/why-you-arent-building-more-muscle\">build muscle</a>.</p>\n<p>He even cut out booze. Slowly, 148 pounds melted off. \u201cBut my self-esteem still wasn\u2019t there \u2014 I still felt like I was 356 pounds,\u201d Kingery says. \u201cI was constantly fighting that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nine months later, Kingery relapsed. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to think about how bad I felt anymore, so I slipped back into my addiction to alcohol,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>He fell back into other unhealthy habits, too, like skipping his workouts and eating greasy fast food. Kingery gained back almost all the weight he lost, hitting 320 pounds again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI felt like I had it all financially, but personally, I felt empty. I didn\u2019t want to keep going,\u201d he says. \u201cSo one day, I brought a bottle of vodka and a handful of painkillers with me up to the 31st floor of my building. I wanted to jump.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut then one of my best friends called, and I told him what I was about to do and he rushed over. The next thing I remember is him saying, \u2018If anyone can change, you can, but you have got to find yourself. If this moment can\u2019t change you, nothing will.\u2019 That hit me hard.\u201d (If you or someone you know is suffering, do not hesitate to contact one of these international <a href=\"http://ibpf.org/resource/list-international-suicide-hotlines\">suicide prevention hotlines</a>.)</p>\n<p>Kingery decided from then on that he\u2019d channel his addictive personality into something positive: getting healthy \u2014 this time for good. \u201cThe gym became my sanctuary,\u201d he says. \u201cBeing strategic about my routine was the only way I was going to figure out what worked for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Because he was so successful the first time around, Kingery approached weight loss the same way again. He spent 30 minutes on either the treadmill or the elliptical almost every day. When he could do that with little struggle, he added strength training back into the mix.</p>\n<p>His current routine looks like this: Five days a week, he spends 20 minutes on the Stairmaster to get his <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/what-is-a-normal-resting-heart-rate\" target=\"_blank\">heart rate</a> up. Then, he lifts, doing five sets of 10 to 15 reps of his chosen exercise, increasing the weight with each set. This includes bicep curls, chest flys, dumbbell presses, and squats, but also <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/best-bodyweight-cardio-exercises\">bodyweight exercises</a> like <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/exercise/pullup\">pullups</a> and tricep dips.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"837\" width=\"621\" data-delta=\"1\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/noah_kingery_pants_size.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<p>The secret to his <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/attack-your-six-pack\">six-pack</a>? He does use tools like <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Valeo-Exercise-Fitness-Training-Abdominal/dp/B075MTJS48\" target=\"_blank\">ab wheel rollers</a> to work his core, but nutrition has made the biggest impact by far, he says. Kingery eats four meals a day, scheduling carb-heavy meals right before and after his workouts.</p>\n<p>He also loads up on <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/protein-myths-messing-up-your-diet\" target=\"_blank\">protein</a> \u2014 like lean cuts of meat, eggs, and Greek yogurt \u2014 so he can build and maintain his lean muscle. His <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/best-high-protein-snacks\">go-to snack</a>? Greek yogurt topped with either flavored protein powder or peanut butter powder, which satisfies his sweet tooth sans the added sugar.

A year later, he stepped away from fashion to become a nutritionist.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been there. I know what it\u2019s like to try and break bad habits. I really wanted to have a purpose in other people\u2019s journeys and see their lives transformed,\" he says. He even helped his mom lose 107 pounds.</p>\n<p>The same year he changed careers, he also got skin removal surgery. \u201cI rebuilt my body, but for me, it\u2019s so much more than skin-deep,\u201d he says. \u201cThis journey has been excruciating, but so worth it. I\u2019ve been sober four years, and I\u2019m a better brother, a better son, and a better friend because of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Today, 30-year-old Kingery still weighs in at 166 pounds. His advice for those looking to make a change in their own lives? Focus on what you can do to help yourself going forward \u2014 don\u2019t dwell on the past too much.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe cannot change what happened yesterday, but what you do today can change tomorrow.\u201d</p>]]></description>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>The New &#039;Deadpool 2&#039; Trailer Is Here, and Boy Does Josh Brolin Look Jacked</title>\n      <link>https://www.menshealth.com/guy-wisdom/deadpool-2-trailer-josh-brolin-cable-ryan-reynolds</link>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">3029136</guid>\n<pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:53:47 +0000</pubDate>\n<dcterms:modified>2018-02-08T13:34:09+00:00</dcterms:modified>\n<dc:creator>Vinnie Mancuso</dc:creator>\n      <description><![CDATA[\n<img src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/deadpol-2-josh-brolin-trailer-1.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" alt=\"deadpool 2 tailer\" />\n<span class=\"copyright\">Photograph courtesy of 20th Century Fox</span>\n<p>The actor, who plays Ryan Reynolds' nemesis Cable, got in insanely good shape for the role</p>\n<p>After Ryan Reynolds <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/guy-wisdom/ryan-reynolds-instagram-deadpool-2\">teased <em>Deadpool 2</em></a> with a <em>Flashdance-</em>inspired Instagram post, 20th Century Fox dropped a brand <a href=\"http://variety.com/2018/film/news/deadpool-2-trailer-debuts-video-ryan-reynolds-cable-1202683199/\">new <em>Deadpool 2</em> trailer</a> that covers all of your <a href=\"http://collider.com/deadpool-character-guide-to-the-merc-with-a-mouth/\">Merc With The Mouth</a> needs.

It tackled a variety of terrain we would have never otherwise attempted</p>\n<p>Reintroducing an icon is no easy task. Back in 2014, that\u2019s what Jeep did when they launched the brand new Cherokee after a 13-year absence. While it sold reasonably well, its looks were somewhat questionable. Squinty-eyed headlamps were anything but Jeep-like and, unlike past models, that was more of a grocery getter than a full-fledged off-roader. For 2019, Jeep has corrected some of its past decisions and delivered a revised Cherokee with a less polarizing look, a new engine option and fantastic on-road handling only outdone by even better off-road prowess.</p>\n<p>Among the more handsome design choices, daytime running lights along with the Bi-LED headlamps are now enclosed in a sculpted sealed beam housing with external driving lights in the lower front fascia. A new 7-slot grill sits upright in an aluminum hood and presents itself in a more mature manner, while out back a restyled composite lift gate features a license plate recess along with an updated bumper and lower treatment for new dual exhaust ports. There are also five new wheel options and 12 different exterior colors to choose from. All of these visual enhancements have helped the 2019 Cherokee evolve from a mild-mannered crossover into a handsome mid-size SUV with a burly demeanor.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1018\" width=\"1600\" data-delta=\"1\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/inline-1-off-road-jeep-2019.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/guy-wisdom/test-drive-review-car-2017-jeep-compass-off-road-vehicle\" target=\"_blank\">The 2017 Jeep Compass Deserves More Respect</a></p>\n<p>Climb into the cabin and you\u2019ll notice a host of interior updates. New materials and colors along with a redesigned center console give the Cherokee an upscale feel and\u2014when properly equipped\u2014it can be quite luxurious. Certain models can be outfitted with options such as leather clad heated and ventilated front seats along with a heated steering wheel.</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s the inclusion of Jeeps fourth-generation UConnect touchscreen infotainment and navigation system, which comes with a 7.0 or 8.4-inch screen with enhanced functionality. It\u2019s one of the most intuitive systems on the market offering occupants\u2019 access to media channels, climate controls, apps, phone and vehicle settings and drive modes. A standard backup camera is also integrated here. Engineers also saw fit to increase rear cargo space by over three inches in width for a total of 54.9 cubic-feet of storage with the rear seats folded down. Charging mobile devices is a snap thanks to multiple USB charge ports and a 115-volt outlet.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1018\" width=\"1600\" data-delta=\"2\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/inline-2-off-road-jeep-2019.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<p>Once underway, the cabin was extremely quiet at speed. During our Los Angeles press drive, routes consisted of highways, canyons and an off-road experience and, regardless of the environment, there wasn't a hint of a rattle or squeak.</p>\n<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.comThe%202018%20Jeep%20Wrangler%20is%20More%20Refined,%20Even%20More%20Rugged\" target=\"_blank\">The 2018 Jeep Wrangler is More Refined, Even More Rugged</a></p>\n<p>We're also introduced to Jeep\u2019s new 2.0-liter turbo inline-4 engine with start-stop technology. It pumps out 270 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque through a revamped 9-speed automatic transmission and will act as the top-of-the-line mill for the Cherokee. Other engine options include the base 2.4-liter Tigershark I-4 that makes 180 hp and 171 lb-ft of torque, and the 3.2-liter Pentastar V-6 with 271 hp and 239 lb-ft. Having driven all three variants, it's safe to say the base 2.4-liter could fall by the wayside. It simply doesn\u2019t have the grunt to properly motivate a vehicle with a minimum curb weight of 3,655-pounds. The Pentastar V-6 or I-4 turbo, however, are both great options.</p>\n<p>The 2019 Cherokee can be purchased with three different 4x4 systems: Jeep Active Drive I, II or Jeep Active Drive Lock. Active Drive I is fully automatic and provides seamless integration of the 4x4 system to the driver. Active Drive II utilizes a two-speed power transfer unit with torque management and low range capabilities, while Active Drive Lock has all the features of Active Drive II but also includes a locking rear differential. (All 4x4-equipped Cherokees come with five different drive modes: Auto, Snow, Sport, Sand/Mud and Rock<em>).</em> While you can get the new Cherokee with front-wheel drive, please don\u2019t. This is a Jeep after all, and Jeeps are supposed to be four-wheel drive, so spend the money and spec it properly.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1018\" width=\"1600\" data-delta=\"3\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/inline-3-off-road-jeep-2019.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<p>When we finally got a chance to tackle the off-road course, I was blown away by just how capable the Cherokee was. With a short billy goat like wheelbase, the Trailhawk tackled a variety of terrain that I would have never attempted. Rocks, sand, steep inclines and descents were overcome with ease. You need to trust the technology that\u2019s integrated into the Cherokee and let it do its thing. For instance, when we can upon a rock obstacle we were told to select \u201cRock\u201d mode, take our foot off the brake, and let the Jeep do the work. Inch-by-inch, the Cherokee climbed up and over, transferring power and torque to each wheel until we were out of harm's way. The same can be said for every other type of terrain we encountered along the course. There is no other mid-size SUV or crossover in this segment that comes close to the off-road abilities of the 2019 Jeep Cherokee.</p>\n<p>Available in five different configurations\u2014Latitude, Latitude Plus, Limited, Overland and Trailhawk<em>\u2014</em>the 2019 Jeep Cherokee offers customers a range of trim levels to satisfy their lifestyle. Combine that with three different engine choices, a host of interior and exterior options and 4x4 capabilities that set the standard for the segment and you\u2019ll soon realize that this new Jeep is definitely worthy of the \u201cCherokee\u201d nameplate.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1018\" width=\"1600\" data-delta=\"4\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/inline-4-off-road-jeep-2019.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<p>Prices start at $23,995.00 for a front-wheel drive Latitude and climb to $37,775.00 for a loaded 4x4 equipped Overland.</p>]]></description>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>While You Were Enjoying Super Bowl Sunday, Your Wife Was Watching Porn</title>\n      <link>https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/porn-data-super-bowl-52-pornhub-xhamster</link>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">3027906</guid>\n<pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2018 18:33:06 +0000</pubDate>\n<dcterms:modified>2018-02-07T13:37:28+00:00</dcterms:modified>\n<dc:creator>Reegan von Wildenradt</dc:creator>\n      <description><![CDATA[\n<img src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/p-1-sad-pats-turn-to-porn.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1018\" alt=\"Sad Patriots fans turned to porn\" />\n<span class=\"copyright\">Image by Getty  </span>\n<p>Data from xHamster shows that women were much more active than men in terms of post-game porn viewership</p>\n<p>The year's biggest night in football just wrapped up, with the Philadelphia Eagles coming out on top over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl 52.

You\u2019re still a young guy, so why is your hair turning silver?</p>\n<p>We associate gray hair with aging, so your graying strands inevitably raise an uncomfortable question: If your hair is aging, is the rest of your body following suit? Are you aging way too fast, and if so, what does that mean for your health?</p>\n<p>First, it is true that graying hair <em>is</em> due to an aging of sorts\u2014but of your melanocytes in your hair bulb. These are the same cells that produce pigment in your skin, says Melissa Piliang, M.D., a dermatologist at the Cleveland Clinic.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey gradually stop producing melanin pigment. The result is initially hair graying and then whitening over time,\" she says. This process does not affect the keratinocytes, which are responsible for producing the hair fiber, so there should not be any changes to your hair <em>structure</em>. However, you may also notice a change in the <em>texture</em> of your hair, like it becoming more coarse or wiry.</p>\n<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/unhealthy-habits-that-make-you-look-older\">6 Common Habits That Make You Look Way Older Than You Are</a></p>\n<p>Not everyone goes gray at the same time, which can be frustratingly obvious if you\u2019re sporting silver in your 30s while your old high school buddy still has glossy, dark hair.</p>\n<p>\"Up to 90 percent of the variation in hair graying can be explained by genetic factors, but we still have limited knowledge about the actual genes responsible,\" says Steve Daveluy, M.D., assistant professor and program director of Wayne State Dermatology.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s one reason why your ethnicity matters for your going-gray potential: \"The average age that hair starts going gray is the mid 30s for Caucasians, late 30ss for Asians and mid 40s for Afro-Caribbeans,\" he says.</p>\n<p>There are some general benchmarks for graying, though.</p>\n<p>\"About 50 percent of people are 50 percent gray by age 50,\" says Dr. Piliang.</p>\n<p><em>6 Grooming Hacks You Need to Know:</em></p>\n \n <media:content url=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/brightcove-proxy/video/4830808094001/file.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n<p>But if you\u2019re graying well before that time frame, does that mean your body is aging way too fast? Might other aspects of your health be in danger?</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a common question, and it\u2019s one that researchers have sought to answer. And there <em>is</em> some evidence that early graying can hint at some health issues, particularly to your heart.</p>\n<p>For instance, a <a href=\"https://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/male-pattern-baldness-and-premature-greying-associated-with-risk-of-early-heart-disease\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> presented at the 69th Annual Conference of the Cardiological Society of India found that men under 40 with premature graying were more than five times as likely as their gray-free counterparts to have coronary artery disease, a narrowing of the arteries that can lead to heart attack. Back in 2012, researchers from the U.K. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16723385\" target=\"_blank\">theorized</a> that the aging of the melanocytes that causes graying could be due to oxidative stress, a biological process that could damage healthy cells and tissue. So the same process going on in your hair cells might be going on elsewhere in your body, too.</p>\n<p>But don\u2019t freak out just yet. The evidence in favor of premature graying hurting your heart still isn\u2019t very strong, says Dr. Daveluy.</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t play the preventive game if silver strands keep popping up, though.</p>\n<p>\"If you do have significant graying before the age of 35, it would be a good idea to make sure you talk to your doctor about optimizing other risk factors for heart disease, like diet, exercise, weight, high blood pressure, high cholesterol,\" says Dr. Daveluy.</p>\n<p>That means it can\u2019t hurt to be extra vigilant about your heart health if you\u2019re going gray. But a few strands of gray hair likely don\u2019t mean as much danger to you heart as known heart-unhealthy habits, like gaining too much weight, smoking, eating junk, or skipping the gym. While you can\u2019t control when you\u2019ll go gray, you <em>are</em> in charge of those other factors\u2014so make them your main focus when thinking about your heart.</p>]]></description>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Michael B.

Next thing you know, your eyes are burning like hell.</p>\n<p>But other times, you\u2019re sweating just as hard, and you barely notice the sweat droplets dripping into your eyes. In those cases, you blink them away without a second thought.</p>\n<p>So why does sweat burn your eyes so badly during some workouts, but not with others?</p>\n<p>Well, it has nothing to do with the kind of workout you\u2019re doing\u2014it has everything to do with how you\u2019re body is prepped before you start sweating.</p>\n<p>We mean one simple thing: hydration.</p>\n<p>Your sweat is composed of water, salt, and other minerals, according to Rayna Habash, M.D., an ophthalmologist and consultant for TopLine MD in Miami. It\u2019s the salt content that can be the kicker when it comes to eye irritation.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe amount of salt fluctuates with the amount of hydration we\u2019ve had that day, which is why our eyes burn more at times than others,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re more hydrated, your sweat will have a lower salt concentration, since the water levels will dilute it more. Less salt in your sweat means less burning when it gets into your sensitive eye tissue.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you\u2019re dehydrated, or even just not at your normal level of hydration, there will be a higher concentration of salt in your sweat. That makes your sweat more irritating.</p>\n<p><em>Are Organic Sports Drinks Better?</em></p>\n \n <media:content url=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/brightcove-proxy/video/5544763916001/file.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n<p>Whether your sweat burns or not can be a handy signal of dehydration\u2014and the good thing is, even though it\u2019s uncomfortable, the irritation isn\u2019t really doing any damage to your eye, Dr. Habash says (Here are <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/dehydration-symptoms\">5 signs of dehydration that have nothing to do with thirst</a>).</p>\n<p>So, what can you do to stop the burn?</p>\n<p>The best thing you can do is play the preventive game: Make sure you\u2019re adequately hydrated before you hit the gym. One way to do that is to gauge the color of your urine\u2014shoot for a consistent color of clear straw or lighter, hydration expert Luke Pyror, Ph.D., C.S.C.S., <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/does-tom-brady-need-25-glasses-of-water-a-day\">told us</a> in the past.</p>\n<p>Plus, pay attention to other markers of dehydration, too. Hydration levels also affect your skin, so if you\u2019re lacking on H20, you might be suffering from dryness, especially in the skin around your eyes.</p>\n<p>Dry skin around your eyes can make the burning effect more pronounced, says Shilpi Agarwal, M.D., a family medicine physician in Los Angeles. That\u2019s because you may have micro-tears from the dryness, which can sting with salty sweat.</p>\n<p>So if you\u2019re dealing with dry skin too, make sure you use a light moisturizer that\u2019s formulated for the eye area, says Dr. Agarwal, and use it at night when it can soak into your skin more effectively. Try one of these <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/style/best-products-for-dry-skin\">best moisturizers for guys with dry skin</a>.</p>\n<p>Another preventive tool: Stay consistent with your exercise program, says Daren Garb, M.D., a family medicine physician at CareMount Medical in New York.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs you get in better shape, the body becomes more efficient and will excrete less sodium, possibly explaining a variation in burning in the eyes,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re experiencing the burn already, splash your face and eyes with cool water, Dr. Garb adds, which is best for getting the salty sweat out quickly.</p>]]></description>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>What Is Jackfruit?

But how do you, uh, actually eat it?</p>\n<p>Unless you're a connoisseur of exotic fruits, you've probably never heard of <a href=\"https://www.today.com/food/what-jackfruit-how-eat-it-bbq-pulled-pork-recipe-t106938\" target=\"_blank\">jackfruit</a>. Originating from Southeast Asia, Brazil, and Africa, jackfruit is a tree-borne, tropical fruit. When ripe, it has a sweet taste similar to that of a pineapple; when it's just off the tree, its flavor is blander, like a potato.</p>\n<p>Jackfruit is having a bit of a moment: according to last month's <a href=\"https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&amp;jsonp=vglnk_151733315395714&amp;key=47c18a0acb2cf2d0e713f4530ca2d7e5&amp;libId=jd1wwjhq01020o8h000DL1kqlhypl&amp;loc=https%3A%2F%2Fmoneyish.com%2Fupgrade%2Frestaurant-experts-say-jackfruit-charcoal-coconut-and-these-menu-items-will-be-hotter-than-ever-this-year%2F&amp;v=1&amp;out=https%3A%2F%2Fresources.upserve.com%2Findustry-report-2018.html&amp;ref=http%3A%2F%2Fweb.nypost.pro%2Fissues%2F164644&amp;title=Jackfruit%2C%20charcoal%2C%20and%2014%20other%20menu%20items%20will%20be%20hotter%20than%20ever%20this%20year&amp;txt=Upserve%E2%80%99s%20State%20of%20the%20Restaurant%20Industry%20Report%20for%202018.%20\" target=\"_blank\">Upserve State of the Restaurant Industry Report</a>, it saw a 131% increase in popularity in 2017, and some researchers have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/23/jackfruit-miracle-crop-climate-change-food-security\" target=\"_blank\">hailed it as a \"miracle\" crop</a> due to its ample nutritional content. But what, exactly, is jackfruit? And is it really all that it's cracked up to be?</p>\n<p>One reason why jackfruit is so popular is because many people consider it an excellent <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/vegan-diet-what-to-know-before-going-plant-based\">vegan</a> or vegetarian meat substitute based on its texture, which is similar to that of pulled meat. A popular choice is using <a href=\"http://www.organicauthority.com/how-to-make-the-ultimate-bbq-jackfruit-pulled-pork/\" target=\"_blank\">jackfruit as a filling inside a pulled \u201cpork\u201d sandwich</a>, says <a href=\"http://www.nutritionalanatalie.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Natalie Rizzo, MS, R</a>D.</p>\n<p>\u201cSome people swear that it tastes like pulled pork, so they substitute it for the meat in tacos and pulled pork sandwiches,\u201d she says. It can also go in soups, grain bowls, salads, yogurt, or even be used as a pizza topping.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1018\" width=\"1600\" data-delta=\"1\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/inline-1-jackfruit.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<p>An additional benefit to jackfruit is that it doesn't have a naturally strong taste when it's just off the tree, so it can take on a wide range of flavors. Many people add spices like cumin, cardamom, chili powder, or paprika to bring out more flavors.</p>\n<p><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\" data-verified=\"redactor\">Related: </strong><a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/can-you-eat-too-much-protein\">Can You Eat Too Much Protein?</a></p>\n<p>But is jackfruit actually the nutritional powerhouse that people say it is? While jackfruit has some great mineral benefits and some fiber content, it doesn\u2019t really make for an excellent meat substitute on its own, says Rizzo.</p>\n<p>\u201cJackfruit may have the same texture as meat, but it\u2019s much lower in <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/ultimate-guide-to-protein-supplements\">protein</a>. A cup only has about 3 grams of protein, but it does also contain iron and calcium, which is often lacking in a vegan diet,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>If you are using jackfruit as a meat substitute<a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/best-plant-protein-sources\">, add in extra protein</a> by pairing it with quinoa, lentils, or chickpeas. (And if <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/vegan-diet-what-to-know-before-going-plant-based\">you are starting a vegan diet</a>, here\u2019s what to know in terms of how much protein you'll need.)</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1017\" width=\"1600\" data-delta=\"2\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/inline-2-jackfruit.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<p>Still, if you see it at your local Whole Foods or health food store, there\u2019s no reason not to try jackfruit out. \u201cJackfruit is good for anyone who likes to experiment with new cooking techniques. It's also good for vegans who like the taste and texture of meat,\u201d says Rizzo.</p>\n<p>In addition to using it in a sandwich, you can also throw soft jackfruit into a taco for a #TacoTuesday, or lather it with BBQ sauce to make a juicy hamburger, says Rizzo. If you are cooking it and using it in a sandwich, Rizzo suggests cutting it into cubes and boiling it for about 45 minutes until it becomes stringy.</p>]]></description>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>I&#039;m a Urologist, and This Is What It&#039;s Like to Treat Over 20 Penises a Day</title>\n      <link>https://www.menshealth.com/health/urologist-jamin-brahmbhatt-day-in-the-life</link>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">3027811</guid>\n<pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2018 16:09:28 +0000</pubDate>\n<dcterms:modified>2018-02-07T13:37:34+00:00</dcterms:modified>\n<dc:creator>Reegan von Wildenradt</dc:creator>\n      <description><![CDATA[\n<img src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/poster-1-Urologist_0.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1018\" alt=\"day in the life of a urologist \" />\n<span class=\"copyright\">Image by Getty  </span>\n<p>Dr. Jamin Brahmbhatt's life is helping guys with their genitals\u2014 and he loves it</p>\n<p>If it weren't for penises, Dr. Jamin Brahmbhatt would be out of a job.

His expertise is in both the male and female urinary tracts as well as <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/9-reproductive-problems-you-can-prevent\">male reproductive health</a>. While he does see female patients for urinary tract issues, the male genitalia take up most of his time.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mom has a hard time explaining what I do to her friends,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"814\" width=\"1280\" data-delta=\"2\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/inline-2-Urologist_0.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<p>His day revolves around penises \u2014 many that are experiencing <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/erectile-dysfunction-myths\">erectile dysfunction</a>, others that pee too much, some that don\u2019t pee enough, and the occasional one that that has a BB pellet shoved up it (yes, really).</p>\n<p>He spends much of his day doing physical exams of the male genitalia. Testicle pain? Brahmbhatt's who you want to see. <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/harmless-reasons-you-cant-get-an-erection\">Having a hard time getting it up?</a> Brahmbhatt can help with that.</p>\n<p>He also does a lot of surgeries on penises and balls that go way beyond a vasectomy. His clinic is one of the first to use surgical robots on male genetalia for something outside of treating cancer. \"The technology we're using is pretty cool. We use (surgical robots) to do everything from help eliminate chronic <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/reasons-your-balls-hurt\">ball pain</a> to putting implants in prostates to help guys pee better.\"</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1200\" width=\"1600\" data-delta=\"3\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/inline-3-Urologist_0.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<p>Like any other doctor, Brahmbhatt also is on-call for emergencies. And unlike a lot of other doctors, he absolutely loves being on-call for the E.R. He never quite knows what to expect. He\u2019s seen dildos stuck in rectums, very stubborn cock rings, a few gunshot wounds to the genital area and a whole lot of <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/9-worst-penile-fracture-stories-ever\">broken penises</a>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhenever I think I\u2019m having a bad day, and I see one of those (a broken penis) I just think, well, I\u2019m definitely not having as bad of a day as this guy,\u201d he chuckles, \u201cAnd I get to help him, which is great.\u201d</p>\n<p>Brahmbhatt says that as a urologist, getting called into the E.R. isn't usually for something life-threatening, because, well, <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/penis-surgery\">you <em>can</em> survive without a penis</a>. But most guys would really prefer to keep it running, and Brahmbhatt loves that he can help.</p>\n<p>It takes a certain type of person to be a urologist, Brahmbhatt explains. Guys simply aren\u2019t that comfortable talking about their health, and especially not their penises. \u201cBeing a urologist requires a good sense of humor,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about pretty sensitive things. Everything we deal with is an uncomfortable part of the body. That\u2019s what attracted me to it. The personality of a urologist is to be able to break down barriers in seconds.\u201d</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1018\" width=\"1600\" data-delta=\"4\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/inline-4-Urologist.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<p>Brahmbhatt says his patients are potentially telling him more about themselves than they\u2019ve ever told anyone in their entire lives \u2014 which is why he immediately goes in, finds some common ground, and maybe cracks a <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/guy-wisdom/orlando-bloom-viral-penis-photo\">penis joke</a> or two to lighten the mood.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnce a patient relaxes, they really open up,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised by how many times I\u2019ve gone into a room thinking there was one thing wrong with a guy, and then he tells me something completely different from what he told the nurse.\"</p>\n<p>Brahmbhatt has heard about every excuse in the book from guys. They flat-out lie to the nurse about why they\u2019re at the doctor, then usually open up to Brahmbhatt about what really happened. But he says the best excuses are in the E.R., with penis trauma.</p>\n<p>\u201cGuys with penis trauma were usually doing something they shouldn't have been doing,\" he says. \"They\u2019ll say that they slammed their car door into their groin or had <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/penis-weight-plate-emergency\">an accident at the gym</a>. Then I come in and I\u2019ll find out they were doing doggie and missed the vagina, or something. I love hearing all the excuses, though. Guys are just so uncomfortable talking about this stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s something Brahmbhatt is trying to change \u2014 the way guys take care of themselves and talk about their health. For the past few years, he\u2019s done an annual \"<a href=\"https://driveformenshealth.com\" target=\"_blank\">Drive 4 Men\u2019s Health</a>\" to try to get guys to talk about their health and to go to the doctor. Every June, he and his partner drive across the country in a cool car, stopping in as many cities as they can to try and change the way guys view their health. What really gets guys to perk up and listen? The car, of course.</p>\n<p>\u201cGuys don\u2019t realize they should be getting their prostates checked every year,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I say is, \u2018You have a car, right? You get the oil changed, you do maintenance work on it. Same with your body. Big difference is, if your car breaks down, you can get a new one. You only have one body.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Something else Brahmbhatt says is extremely common is guys coming in worrying about their <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/can-your-penis-actually-shrink\">penis size</a>.</p>\n<p>\u201cMost guys come in and think they\u2019re not adequate. I\u2019ve seen a lot of penises, and I can tell you right now, you\u2019re fine. I\u2019ve never seen a penis I didn\u2019t think couldn\u2019t actually have sex,\u201d he says. \u201cMy advice to guys is to stop looking at porn and judging your penis. You may not be able to be employed in Vegas as a porn star, like most men, but you\u2019re completely fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Take it from a guy who has seen thousands of penises.</p>]]></description>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Build Bigger, Stronger Arms With This Superset </title>\n      <link>https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/cable-machine-superset-arm-exercises</link>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">3027221</guid>\n<pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2018 21:12:11 +0000</pubDate>\n<dcterms:modified>2018-02-06T13:37:43+00:00</dcterms:modified>\n<dc:creator>Naomi Nazario</dc:creator>\n      <description><![CDATA[\n<img src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/Gather_CAble.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" alt=\"cable machine superset arm exercises\" />\n<span class=\"copyright\">Photograph by Men's Health</span>\n<p>Use it as a finisher or as a quick workout for when you're short on time</p>\n<p>When it comes to your arms, your biceps and triceps are the stars of the show.

It wasn't for lack of motivation; he was born with cystic fibrosis, which can not only make exercising difficult, it can make the simple task of breathing a challenge all on its own. But Mudge has defied the odds \u2014 not just in getting ripped as hell dude, but in transforming himself into <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/man-cystic-fibrosis-gym-muscles-personal-trainer-recover-health-improve-thor-a8191616.html\" target=\"_blank\">a real-life version of one of the most jacked superheroes of all time, Thor</a>.</p>\n<iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameBorder=\"0\" src=\"//www.instagram.com/p/BeFqe_qlHT5/embed\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<p>It's pretty easy to see the resemblance.

But it's not just his weekly \"Thorsday\" posts that the 27-year-old's 55,000 Instagram followers love about him. Mudge is living with <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cystic-fibrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353700\" target=\"_blank\">cystic fibrosis</a>, and his story of overcoming the associated challenges to get to where he is today is inspiring others with the genetic condition to get fit, as well.</p>\n<iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameBorder=\"0\" src=\"//www.instagram.com/p/Bdz3i0IlzVF/embed\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<p>Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that causes damage to the multiple organs in the body, especially the lungs and digestive system. It affects the cells that produce secreted fluids in the body \u2014 namely sweat, mucus and digestive juices. These fluids are supposed to act as lubricants in the body, but in people with cystic fibrosis, these fluids become thick and sticky. Besides making it difficult to <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/breathe-like-a-yogi\" target=\"_blank\">breathe</a>, this can cause problems with digestion and make it difficult to gain weight and properly grow.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cystic-fibrosis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353706\" target=\"_blank\">Mayo Clinic</a>, exercising regularly can help those with cystic fibrosis by loosening up mucus and improving heart and lung function. Though it can be hard for people with cystic fibrosis to start an exercise regimen, Mudge has proven the hard work is worth it.</p>\n<p>Mudge was always a fairly active kid, according to the <em>Independent</em>. But when he was 18, he developed a lung infection from his cystic fibrosis that landed him in the hospital. Doctors told him his lung capacity was just 66 percent \u2014 a scary-low number for such a young person.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was scary,\u201d he told the <em>Independent</em>. \u201cI\u2019d never had any issues with breathing at all before that. But then after that it felt like someone was squeezing the bottom of my lungs shut. That\u2019s when I knew I had to get exercising.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mudge, who was self-admittedly a scrawny kid, turned to fitness as a way to improve his lung capacity and overall health. And that it did \u2014 today, nearly 10 years after his hospitalization, his lung capacity is at 95 percent, and he attributes most of that improvement to the gym.</p>\n<p>Mudge said that in the beginning, just lifting up a barbell was challenging. Today, his Instagram is full of his amazing gym feats, like this very impressive set of <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/better-bridging\" target=\"_blank\">glute bridges</a>.</p>\n<iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameBorder=\"0\" src=\"//www.instagram.com/p/BYis9yrANUe/embed\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<p>The Thor persona came about when friends at the gym started commenting he looked like the comic book hero. He decided to go all-out and grow out his hair, and hasn't looked back. \"Thor is not just a name, it\u2019s a mantle,\u201d he said. \u201cGrowing my hair long to look more like Thor is definitely a big part of what keeps me motivated, and encourages me to keep training.\u201d</p>\n<iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameBorder=\"0\" src=\"//www.instagram.com/p/Bb1jRB4lcDF/embed\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<p>Mudge's story is especially inspiring to those living with cystic fibrosis.

Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson is bringing a fitness competition to NBC, and it's currently accepting applications. The three obvious questions here are as follows:</p>\n<p>1. What kind of fitness competition is this?</p>\n<p>2. What exactly does one have to do to get on The Rock's fitness reality show?</p>\n<p>3. How on Earth does he get all this stuff done \u2014 a new reality show, <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/the-rock-thanks-crew-on-set-gym-workout\">workout out</a>, <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/guy-wisdom/the-rock-skyscraper-movie-poster\">rescuing people from burning skyscrapers</a> \u2014 with just 24 hours in a day?</p>\n<p>We've got some answers for two of three, at least. First of all, the idea behind <em>The Titan Games</em> is to \"offer everyday people the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to compete in epic head-to-head challenges designed to test mind, body and heart,\" according to its <a href=\"https://www.titangamescasting.com/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>. There aren't any details on what these challenges will consist of, but the website promises they'll be \"physical challenges of epic proportions.\" We certainly wouldn't expect anything less from The Rock, who'll be <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/guy-wisdom/the-rock-rampage-trailer-classic-arcade-game\">fighting a giant mutant ape</a> in one of his upcoming movies.</p>\n<p>Second, what kind of chance does a regular guy (or gal) have of getting on the show? Per the <a href=\"https://www.titangamescasting.com/pdf/titan-games-video-specs.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">application</a>, all a person has to do is submit a three-minute video describing themselves and showing off their fitness. There's also opportunity to write a bit more about yourself, and then, of course, there's a small \"fitness test\" to complete on camera. It has three parts: a core test (hold a <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/gym-jones-plank\" target=\"_blank\">plank</a> for as long as possible); an endurance test (<a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/jumping-rope-workout-circuit-exercises\" target=\"_blank\">jump rope</a> for two minutes); and a strength test. The strength test is a <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/total-body-ladder-workout\" target=\"_blank\">descending ladder</a> of pull-ups and pushups, starting with five of each, then four of each, all the way down to one rep of each. Time to start working on that <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/ben-lauder-dykes-pull-up-variations\" target=\"_blank\">pull-up strength</a>.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately we're just as baffled as the rest of you as to how exactly The Rock is finding time to host a new reality show. Maybe that <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/guy-wisdom/the-rock-talks-about-high-school-years-instagram-lebron-james\" target=\"_blank\">time machine joke Johnson had with LeBron James</a> wasn't really a joke after all.</p>\n<p>Johnson said while on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti8CzxxD5Qk\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon</em></a> that he drew inspiration for the show from one of his all-time favorite fitness reality shows, <em>American Ninja Warrior</em>. Yes, you're understanding this correctly: <em>The Titan Games</em> is the making of Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/the-rock-instagram-workout-video-upper-body\" target=\"_blank\">a man who single-handedly gives a new meaning to fitness</a> \u2014 and draws inspiration from <em><a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/otis-hooper-american-ninja-warrior\" target=\"_blank\">American Ninja Warrior</a></em>.

That\u2019s why when <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/life/the_kids/2017/01/you_can_t_protect_yourself_from_norovirus_by_guzzling_grape_juice.html\" target=\"_blank\">multiple reports</a> (<a href=\"https://musthavemom.com/stomp-out-stomach-flu-with-grape-juice/\" target=\"_blank\">most notably from blogger moms</a>) surfaced about grape juice\u2019s ability to fend off the violent virus last year, they went viral.</p>\n<p>But as with most Google-able remedies, this one\u2019s not as straightforward as it seems. Read on before you glug a bottle of Welch\u2019s.</p>\n<h2>Can Grape Juice Prevent the Stomach Flu?</h2>\n<p>There\u2019s no conclusive evidence that grape juice will prevent or fight norovirus, confirms Kellogg J. Schwab, Ph.D., a professor at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health who researches norovirus.</p>\n<p>The thought behind the claim? Grape juice could alter the pH levels in your stomach, so the norovirus can\u2019t multiply. Plus, thanks to the juice\u2019s anti-viral and antioxidant properties, it might even flush, fight, or kill the virus.</p>\n<p>But those theories don\u2019t really live up to the hype. \u201cThe pH balance in the stomach is changing at all times depending on what you eat or drink or what time of the day it is. When you drink something acidic, it may decrease pH in the stomach, but that would only be temporarily,\u201d explains Amber Tully, M.D., a family medicine physician at the Cleveland Clinic. Plus, norovirus doesn\u2019t multiply in your stomach, it multiples in your intestines, which naturally has a more neutral pH, she adds.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also worth mentioning that not everyone is susceptible to the 150 circulating strains of norovirus. \u201cThere are sub-populations of people who don't have the right receptors for the virus to attach to, meaning they don\u2019t get sick,\u201d says Schwab. That means that there could be other reasons (besides drinking grape juice) that you didn\u2019t come down with norovirus when everyone else around you did.</p>\n<p>While some <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3485726/\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> done in petri dishes has suggested grape seed extract may reduce the chances of a norovirus multiplying enough to causes infection, you\u2019re not getting those chemicals from the seeds when you drink grape juice, says Dr. Tully.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuman noroviruses are very hard to replicate in a lab setting\u2014and surrogates may or may not reflect what\u2019s going on in the human body,\u201d says Schwab.</p>\n<p>Grapes <em data-redactor-tag=\"em\" data-verified=\"redactor\">are</em> high in <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/vitamin-c-foods\">vitamin C</a>, though\u2014and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19263912\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> does show that C is helpful in boosting immunity. Still, to rely on grape juice alone is probably not the way to go.</p>\n<p><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\" data-verified=\"redactor\">Related:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/flu-myths\">7 Myths About the Flu You Must Stop Believing</a></p>\n<h2>How Can You Protect Yourself From the Stomach Flu?</h2>\n<p>Norovirus spreads when you make direct contact with someone who\u2019s sick, down foods or drinks contaminated with virus, or touch surfaces with the virus on it, so <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/style/how-to-wash-your-hands\">washing your hands</a> is the single most important thing you can do to protect your health and the health of those around you, says Schwab.</p>\n<p>Scrubbing with soap won\u2019t <em data-redactor-tag=\"em\" data-verified=\"redactor\">kill</em> the virus, but it will remove it from your hands if it\u2019s present. Choose a non-antimicrobial soap and skip hand sanitizers, which do not effectively inactivate the virus, he says. Otherwise, wash your fruits and vegetables and be careful about touching other people\u2019s hands or sharing utensils and pens.

No problem</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re an avid <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/smarter-way-do-high-intensity-interval-training\">HIIT</a> or CrossFit junkie, you\u2019ve probably done your fair share of AMRAPS by now. Usually, they involve <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/dell-polanco-amrap-challenge\">doing several burpees in a row</a> within 60 seconds, and ending up on the floor out of breath. But if you've never done CrossFit before, you've probably wondered what your friends are talking about when they use the acronym.</p>\n<p>AMRAP stands for \"as many reps as possible\" or \"as many rounds as possible.\" It's a workout structure frequently used for conditioning that pushes your body to the max within a set period of time (anywhere from 3 minutes to 60 minutes).</p>\n<p>To do an AMRAP, you set a timer for a certain amount of time, and pick a set of exercises (say, 10 pushups, 10 pull-ups, and 10 squats). Repeat that sequence for as many rounds as possible until time expires, resting when needed.</p>\n<p>Doing AMRAPs helps you track your progress over time, as you\u2019re basing your review of your performance off a set period of time or a specific exercise.</p>\n<p>\u201cAMRAPs allow you to specify the amount of time that a training session will take. This is important for shooting for specific kinds of adaptation. If you know that you'll be going for exactly 7 minutes, it's much easier to understand the pacing of the effort required over that 7 minutes,\u201d says <a href=\"http://toddnief.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Todd Nief</a>, head CrossFit coach and owner of <a href=\"http://southloopsc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">South Loop Strength &amp; Conditioning</a> in Chicago. As you keep at it, you can see if you can do more and more rounds within those 7 minutes with practice.</p>\n<p>It also pushes that intensity factor, so you\u2019re not wasting any time activating those muscles and breaking a sweat. (FYI, there are <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/guy-wisdom/amrap-mentality-outside-gym\">benefits to having an AMRAP mentality outside the gym</a>, too.)</p>\n<p>\u201cRather than specifying reps, sets, and rest time, you are able to move through as quickly as you are capable, which will increase the overall training volume completed in a specific timeframe,\u201d explains Nief.</p>\n<p>Below, Nief takes us through the dos and don'ts of doing AMRAPs and suggests a few workouts that'll have you dripping sweat on the floor in no time.</p>\n<p><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\" data-verified=\"redactor\">Related: </strong><a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/deadly-40-minute-workout-will-shrink-belly\">This Deadly 40-Minute Workout Will Shrink Your Belly</a></p>\n<p><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\" data-verified=\"redactor\">1) Before starting AMRAPs, make sure you know the rules.</strong> \u201cHaving a basic understanding of your expected split times is crucial for an AMRAP. If you look at a workout, you should be able to guess roughly how long each movement will take you, how long you expect to spend transitioning from exercise to exercise, and how much you expect to slow down over the course of the session,\u201d says Nief.</p>\n<p><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\" data-verified=\"redactor\">2) Try not to make common mistakes that can impair your performance.</strong> \u201cMost people go out way too fast at the beginning of an AMRAP. Especially if it's longer than 5 minutes, this can set them up to be very uncomfortable for the last half of their workout,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\" data-verified=\"redactor\">3) Keep in mind that you\u2019ll naturally slow down as you get fatigued,</strong> <strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\" data-verified=\"redactor\">but don't let it come on too quickly.</strong> \u201cPeople should expect to probably slow down a bit over the course of the AMRAP, but their later rounds shouldn't be <em data-redactor-tag=\"em\">that</em> much slower than the first few rounds, and they also shouldn't get to the point that they're engaging in a ton of compensatory patterns to complete their reps,\u201d Nief explains.</p>\n<p><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\" data-verified=\"redactor\">4) Set a specific goal for how many rounds/reps to complete before time is up.</strong> \u201cPeople often create AMRAPs without understanding what their goal is for the session. If you want to move quickly the entire time, you need to set something up so that you will be able to keep going through the rounds without significant breakdown over the course of the training session,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\" data-verified=\"redactor\">5) Try to mix it up.</strong> For instance, \u201cif you have both a <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/how-to-fail-a-squat-safely\">squatting-based movement</a> and <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/sandbag-lunge-sequence\">a lunging-based movement</a>, you can assume that you will run into a limiter with muscle endurance in your quads,\u201d he says, as it puts excess strain on the area.</p>\n<p><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\" data-verified=\"redactor\">Related: </strong><a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/dell-polanco-amrap-challenge\">10-Minute AMRAP Challenge</a></p>\n<p>To get you started, here are a few AMRAP workouts to get you blasting fat and building muscle.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"636\" width=\"1000\" data-delta=\"1\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/AMPR-workout-circuit-1.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<p>1) One of the most famous and classic starter AMRAPs is \"Cindy\" (20 min.):</p>\n<p>5 pull-ups</p>\n<p>10 push-ups</p>\n<p>15 squats</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"636\" width=\"1000\" data-delta=\"2\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/AMPR-workout-circuit-2.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<p>2) This workout is great for a muscle endurance training session, says Nief.

It\u2019s all about how you take care of your body.\u201d</p>\n<p>While the perception is that golfers don\u2019t <em>need</em> to be physically fit to perform, Koepka insists it\u2019s what is giving him an edge over his opponents. \u201cAfter four weeks of tournaments, and it comes down to that last Sunday, I know I\u2019m more physically fit than most.\u201d</p>\n<p>Koepka says that when he heads into long tournaments, the benefits of taking care of himself extend far beyond the physical gains. While he says <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/best-glutes-and-hips-workout-circuit\" target=\"_blank\">glute and core strength</a> really help in instances when he has a bad lie in the rough, the mental gains of taking care of his body definitely are profound, and play a big role in his golf game. \u201cA lot of it is mental, obviously, and I mentally feel good when I\u2019m healthy. It gives me an edge, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>Koepka attributes much of his mental strength to his diet, which he says consists mostly of whole, clean foods. \u201cI know it sounds weird, but I travel with a chef,\" he says. \"He cooks me really healthy meals.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another thing Koepka says keeps his mental game strong is giving his mind and his body a break. He says his favorite way to unwind\u2014surprise!\u2014is grabbing a few beers, his girlfriend, and some friends and heading out on his boat.</p>\n<p>\u201cStaying fit is fun, but you have to have a good balance in your life,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>So take it from a pro: Part of living a healthy lifestyle is, well, taking time to enjoy life.

Wings, nachos, burgers, chips, and beer; It really doesn\u2019t get any better than that, does it? If you\u2019re throwing your own party this year or just attending someone else's, you\u2019re going to need some boozy delights to keep spirits high throughout the game. Below are two hassle free punch bowl recipes that you can prep the night before. And sample the night before too, because you gotta taste it, right?</p>\n<h2>J\u00e4germule Punch</h2>\n<p><em>Crafted by Flinn Pomroy, Sweetwater Social</em></p>\n<p><strong>What You Need:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>125 oz J\u00e4germeister</li>\n<li>42.5 oz Fresh Lime Juice</li>\n<li>37.5 oz Ginger Syrup</li>\n<li>35 oz Bigelow Orange &amp; Spice Tea</li>\n<li>60 oz Soda Water (add to taste)</li>\n<li>2 whole oranges sliced into thin discs (to garnish)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How To Make It:</strong></p>\n<p>Combine J\u00e4germeister, Lime Juice, and Ginger Syrup in punch bowl. Bring 5 cups of water to a boil and add 5 tea bags of Bigelow Orange &amp; Spice. Remove water from heat and allow to steep for roughly 6 minutes (Note: you will have more tea brewed than you are actually going to use). Add Bigelow Orange &amp; Spice tea to the punch bowl. Stir vigorously, and add soda to taste. Garnish with orange slices.</p>\n<p><strong>Pairs Well With:</strong></p>\n<p>Smoky, spice-forward barbecue sauce or wings which will bring out the spices in the Bigelow Orange &amp; Spice Tea.</p>\n<h2>Peach Lemonade Punch</h2>\n<p><em>Crafted by Nolet's Gin</em></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"636\" width=\"1000\" data-delta=\"1\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/2-Super-Bowl-Drink-Essentials-Party-peach-lemonade.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<p><strong>What You Need:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 bottle of Nolet's Silver Dry Gin</li>\n<li>2.25 L Lemonade</li>\n<li>6.3 oz Elderflower Liqueur</li>\n<li>2 bags frozen peaches, cut appropriately</li>\n<li>Lemon or peach slices (to garnish)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How To Make It:</strong></p>\n<p>Combine all ingredients in punch bowl and stir.

We live in an age where there are tons of services that will deliver right to your door. We did some research and found three great services that can help you out in a pinch.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to seriously amp up your home bar, we recommend <a href=\"https://minibardelivery.com/store\" target=\"_blank\">Minibar Delivery</a>.

If you\u2019re feeling <em>really</em> fancy, you can even schedule a professional mixologist to serve your party. All you have to do is choose how long and confirm the details.</p>\n<p>If you need to stock up on booze, food, <em>and</em> paper goods for your party we suggest <a href=\"https://www.maxdelivery.com/nkz/exec/HomePage/Display\" target=\"_blank\">MaxDelivery</a>.

Your productivity might not be the only thing in danger. Men who experience migraines\u2014severe, throbbing headaches that are usually confided on one side of the head and can come with nausea and light sensitivity\u2014are at higher risk of heart problems than those without the condition, new <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/360/bmj.k96\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> out of Denmark suggests.</p>\n<p>In the study, researchers pulled health records over 19 years from about 50,000 people who suffered from migraines and more than 500,000 people who didn\u2019t have the headaches. Over that time, migraine sufferers were more than twice as likely to experience an ischemic stroke\u2014the most common kind of stroke, caused by an artery blockage in your brain\u201449 percent more likely to have a heart attack, 59 percent more likely to have <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/blood-clot-deep-vein-thrombosis-symptoms\">a blood clot in your legs or lung</a>, and 25 percent more likely to have an irregular heartbeat.</p>\n<p>In particular, the chances of experiencing a stroke were much higher within the first year of the migraine diagnosis. Men with migraines had 12 times the risk of a stroke within that first year than those without the headaches.</p>\n<p>One possible reason? Something called a vasospasm in the arteries of your brain, explains study author Kasper Adelborg, M.D., Ph.D. A vasospasm\u2014the constricting and narrowing of blood vessels that blocks blood flow\u2014can lead to a migraine, but it can also boost your changes of having a stroke, too.</p>\n<p>As for the heart risks, it\u2019s possible that the meds many people take to control the pain with migraines might be playing a role, too. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs like ibuprofen or naproxen) have been shown to <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/nsaid-and-heart-attack\">increase your chances of heart attack</a>, as we reported. That\u2019s because they may trigger abnormal clotting of your blood.</p>\n<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/signs-heart-attack-in-future\">6 Surprising Signs You're On Your Way To a Heart Attack</a></p>\n<p>But before you get too freaked out, it\u2019s important to recognize that the <em>absolute</em> risk experiencing such problems was still pretty low. Take a heart attack, for instance. For every 1,000 people with migraine, 25 would experience a heart attack over that 19-year period, compared to 17 without migraine.</p>\n<p>The low risk is in part because the people in the study were relatively young, with an average age in their mid-30s. Things like heart attack and stroke aren\u2019t all that common to begin with in that age group.</p>\n<p>But even that small increase in risk can be significant.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe increased risk translates into a substantial increase in risk at the population level, because migraine is a common disease, affecting many men worldwide,\u201d says Dr. Adelborg.</p>\n<p><em>8 Weird Facts You Never Knew About Your Heart:</em></p>\n \n <media:content url=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/brightcove-proxy/video/5031240079001/file.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n<p>More studies need to be done to determine if migraines need to be treated differently to alleviate these heart risks\u2014in particular, whether guys at higher risk of heart problems should also be taking blood thinners in addition to their NSAIDs, he says.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, if you\u2019re suffering from any kind of recurring headache, loop in your doctor. He or she can help you determine if you\u2019re suffering from migraines, and if so, which treatment is most appropriate. Plus, your doctor can also monitor things like blood pressure and cholesterol levels, which can help gauge your risk of heart disease.</p>]]></description>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>If Your Neighbors Are Obese, It Could Be Contagious</title>\n      <link>https://www.menshealth.com/health/is-obesity-contagious-study</link>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">3025321</guid>\n<pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2018 16:40:23 +0000</pubDate>\n<dcterms:modified>2018-02-03T13:37:17+00:00</dcterms:modified>\n<dc:creator>Danielle Zickl</dc:creator>\n      <description><![CDATA[\n<img src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/neighbors-obese-potentially-contageous.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" alt=\"If Your Neighbors Are Obese, It Could Be Contagious\" />\n<span class=\"copyright\">Image by Getty  </span>\n<p>If the people around you are overweight, it may increase your own chances of packing on pounds, according to a new study </p>\n<p>Obesity in America is on the rise. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/obesity-rate-in-america\">more than 20 percent of adults</a> in every state are affected by this epidemic. And while there are many reasons why this may be \u2014 genetics, eating too much fast food \u2014 a new study suggests another explanation: your neighbors.</p>\n<p>Published in <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2668504\" target=\"_blank\"><em>JAMA Pediatrics</em></a>, the study sought to find out if people who live in communities where the majority of people are obese are more likely to become obese by association \u2014 almost like how the flu spreads from person to person. In other words, is obesity contagious?</p>\n<p>From November 2016 to October 2017, study authors Ashlesha Datar, Ph.D., Director of Program on Children and Families at USC\u2019s Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research, and Nancy Nicosia, Ph.D., senior economist at the RAND Corporation, gathered data from 1,519 military families \u2014 men, women, and children \u2014 living on 38 bases across the country that had varying levels of obesity.</p>\n<p>\"One of the reasons we chose to study military families is that these families cannot choose where they live. Rather, they are assigned to installations,\" Datar told <em>Men's Health</em>. \"Some of those installations are in counties with higher rates of obesity while others are in counties with lower rates of obesity. So, this would allow us to examine whether living in communities with a higher risk of obesity increases one\u2019s own risk of being obese.\"</p>\n<p>The results? For every 1 percent increase in a county's obesity rate, the risk of a teenager becoming overweight went up between 4 and 6 percent, and the risk of an adult becoming overweight went up by 5 percent.</p>\n<p>Datar attributes the study's findings to the social contagion theory. If more people around you are obese, that may increase your own chances of becoming obese.</p>\n<p>\"In other words,\" Datar says, \"living in a community where obesity is more common can make sedentary lifestyles, unhealthy eating, and overweight or obesity more socially acceptable.\"</p>\n<p>Datar says that families exposed to more obese communities reported being less physically active, less likely to have a healthier home environment (tons of junk food in their cabinets and no limit on how much of it they ate), and less likely to cook at home. (Here's why making meals in your own kitchen can help you <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/cooking-at-home-healthy-eating-lose-weight\">lose weight and drop body fat</a>.)</p>\n<p><em>Try making this spicy ground chicken and vegetable stir fry for dinner tonight:</em></p>\n \n <media:content url=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/brightcove-proxy/video/5089281136001/file.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n<p>Datar and Nicosia are following these military families over time, and hope to have specific data on the weight changes of participants starting from when they began living in their current counties in the near future.</p>\n<p>But their findings so far don't only apply to military families.</p>\n<p>\"Our data suggests that the rate of overweight or obesity in military families is close to that in the civilian population,\" Datar says. \"Moreover, a growing proportion of military families live outside the installation in civilian communities, and their children largely attend public schools.

While there were a lot of fun statistics to come out of this year\u2019s edition, one fact stood out: some of us are messing up sex.</p>\n<p>In the survey, Match.com asked single people what their biggest red flags were during sex \u2014 the things most likely to make them say it was bad. 82 percent of singles said \u201ctoo much talking\u201d was the quickest way to get sex rated as bad, followed by \u201cno passion\u201d at 74 percent, \u201clittle movement\u201d at 63 percent, and finally, being a bad kisser at 62 percent.</p>\n<p>(Are you a bad kisser? <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/lousy-kisser\">Here's how you can tell.</a>)</p>\n<p>So what's the opposite of someone who talks too much, doesn't move, and isn't passionate? The study had some insight into what makes for good sex as well.</p>\n<p>An overwhelming 83 percent of singles \u201cregard a caring and enthusiastic partner\u201d as the number one sign of good sex. The second most important indicator of good sex, the survey said, was <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/tips-for-a-better-relationship\">communication</a>, at 78 percent, and \u201cbeing a good kisser\u201d came in third at 76 percent.

The data shows that ideally, to have great sex, you should be genuinely into the sex you\u2019re having, be an open communicator (but don\u2019t talk too much!), and make damn sure you\u2019re a good kisser.

But if you're like Theo, you might have a serious problem</p>\n<p>Theo*, 47, has a successful job, a daughter, and many healthy friendships. From the outside, it appear as though he has a fairly conventional life. But for most of his life, he had a problem: he <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/masturbation-secrets\">masturbated</a>. A lot.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere were times it would be every day, for only 15-20 minutes, and other times I would masturbate for eight, 10, or 12 hours,\u201d he says. And when he started, he could not stop.</p>\n<p>\"For me, it was a maladaptive coping mechanism,\" he says. \"[It was] much akin to someone going to a bar and wanting to get that edge off with a drink, and then five or six drinks later, they have a problem. But everything else [in my life was] in control.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eventually, Theo went to therapy and discovered what he had already suspected: he had a problem with out-of-control <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/how-porn-affects-your-sex-life\">porn use</a>. But acknowledging that he had an issue was only the first step to getting his life back.</p>\n<p><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\" data-verified=\"redactor\">Related: </strong><a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/shocking-masturbation-facts\">11 Shocking Facts You Never Knew About Masturbation</a></p>\n<p>In itself, getting off on a regular basis is hardly a problem. In fact, for the vast majority of men, masturbation isn't just enjoyable \u2014 it's healthy. Studies have suggested that <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/5-reasons-you-should-masturbate-tonight\">regular masturbation</a> can improve your immune system, reduce your cancer risk, and boost your performance in bed.</p>\n<p><em>Four Reasons to Masturbate:</em></p>\n \n <media:content url=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/brightcove-proxy/video/4119626818001/file.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n<p>But for a small percentage of men (one sexual health organization puts the number at <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/sex-addiction-epidemic-66289\" target=\"_blank\">3 to 5 percent</a> of the general population, though specific numbers are hard to come by), masturbation can cross the line from a healthy habit to a compulsive behavior.</p>\n<p>While the term \"sex addiction\" is often used to describe such behavior, it\u2019s important to note one thing: sex addiction is a <a href=\"https://www.aasect.org/position-sex-addiction\" target=\"_blank\">hotly debated topic</a> in the medical and mental health community, to the point that many experts question whether it\u2019s even a legitimate disorder. It isn't in the American Psychiatric Association (APA)'s <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/07/sex-addiction-dsm-official-disorder_n_2258027.html\" target=\"_blank\">Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Psychiatric Disorders, a.k.a. the DSM-V</a>, nor is it a term used by the <a href=\"https://www.aasect.org/\" target=\"_blank\">American Association of Sexual Educators, Counselors, and Therapists</a> (AASECT), an organization devoted to promoting sexual health. In a <a href=\"https://www.aasect.org/position-sex-addiction\" target=\"_blank\">statement on its website</a>, AASECT says it \"does not find sufficient empirical evidence to support the classification of sex addiction or porn addiction as a mental health disorder.\"</p>\n<p>But that doesn't mean that compulsive masturbation or sexual activity doesn't cause significant duress to those who struggle with it. That's why AASECT prefers to use to the term \"out of control sexual behavior,\" which includes compulsively watching online porn, hiring sex workers, having numerous extramarital affairs, etc.</p>\n<p>There are a few reasons why the term \"sex addiction\" has caused so much controversy. Often, people use the label as a way to excuse bad behavior or gloss over a deeper emotional issue that needs exploring. (Remember <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anthony-weiner-sex-addiction_us_591f26d5e4b034684b0c14aa\" target=\"_blank\">Anthony Weiner going to sex addiction rehab</a> after he was caught sexting for the umpteenth time?)</p>\n<p>\"Many times, clients have come in describing themselves as 'sex addict,' and what I discover is that they are feeling guilty for watching porn two times a week when they promised their partner they wouldn't. Or they are having an affair and are feeling ashamed and unable to end it because they have developed an emotional attachment to the lover,\" says Sari Cooper LCSW, CST, the founder and director of the <a href=\"https://centerforloveandsex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Love and Sex</a> in New York City.</p>\n<p>Just as an eating disorder is usually about much more than food, the root of a compulsive sexual behavior is often about sex at all. Usually, there are underlying psychological issues. Theo, for instance, was sexually abused as a child, and says he has been struggling with out-of-control porn use ever since.</p>\n<p>\"Because I experienced something traumatic that sexually activated me at a young age, watching porn and masturbating became a go-to for managing stress or anxiety and dealing with my feelings,\" he says.</p>\n<p><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\" data-verified=\"redactor\">Related: </strong><a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/how-porn-affects-your-sex-life\">The Truth About How Porn Affects Your Sex Life</a></p>\n<p>So how do you know if you\u2019ve crossed the line from simply enjoying your own company, to having an out-of-control sexual behavior?</p>\n<p>Well, there's good news: just because you like to get off (a lot) doesn't necessarily mean that you have a problem, says Cooper. It's possible that you could have an unusually high <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/sex-drive-differences\">libido</a>. The difference between having an unusually high libido and having a compulsion is whether you use masturbation as an escape or a coping mechanism, rather than just for an overall good time.</p>\n<p>There is no magic number for how many times a day you must masturbate to be diagnosed with a compulsive sexual disorder.\"While the sex addiction industry sets some sort of number... the out-of-control sexual behavior model [is defined as] a person's internal sense of their own agency not being clearly understandable to the individual,\" says Cooper (basically, if your sexual behavior makes you feel helpless or out of control).</p>\n<p>Additionally, if your masturbation habits are \u201ctaking time away from family, work and responsibilities,\" or if you're \"at risk for job loss, financial ruin, criminal charges and/or sexually transmitted infections,\" then that might mean you have a problem, says Cooper.</p>\n<p>But it doesn't have to be extreme as that. Theo, for instance, knew he had a problem when masturbation became his sole outlet for managing stress and anxiety. A workaholic, he used porn as a way to unwind and escape from daily stressors. At his lowest point, he was masturbating for 12 hours a day, which didn't leave much time to connect with real-life women.</p>\n<p>\"I realized my behavior was dulling and deadening the quality of life and the vibrancy of intimacy. I wasn't really able to connect with partners and be present in life,\" says Theo. \"There were large gaps of time that were lost. I didn't have the same energy.\"</p>\n<p><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\" data-verified=\"redactor\">Related: </strong><a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/sex-addiction\">Are You a Sex Addict or Just a Guy?</a></p>\n<p>Fortunately, compulsive sexual behaviors are treatable. The key is acknowledging you have a problem, communicating about it, and getting to the root of the behavior.</p>\n<p>Cooper suggests consulting a mental health expert or seeking a certified sex therapist for a basic assessment. If you're looking for a support system, there are also 12-step programs for out-of-control sexual behaviors. Avoid any expensive rehabilitation programs that claim to \"cure\" sex or porn addiction.</p>\n<p>Theo, who has been in therapy for years, says the first thing to do is start a dialogue with your loved ones. Be prepared to face confusion or judgment, at least at first. \"There's a huge stigma applied to porn, because so many people watch it, so talking about abusing porn with other people can be difficult because they get defensive,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, it's important to \"talk to people who are valuable in your life, so you're not living in denial, shame, guilt, or awkwardness.\"</p>\n<p>*<em data-redactor-tag=\"em\">Last name has been withheld to allow subjects to speak freely on private matters.</em></p>]]></description>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>The Buick Regal TourX Wagon is Shockingly Awesome</title>\n      <link>https://www.menshealth.com/guy-wisdom/test-drive-review-buick-regal-tourx-wagon</link>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">3024466</guid>\n<pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 17:46:11 +0000</pubDate>\n<dcterms:modified>2018-02-02T13:38:07+00:00</dcterms:modified>\n<dc:creator>Brett Berk</dc:creator>\n      <description><![CDATA[\n<img src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/p-1-The-buick-regal-tourx-wagon-is-awesome.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1018\" alt=\"Buick Regal TourX Wagon\" />\n<span class=\"copyright\">Photograph courtesy of Buick</span>\n<p>Buick's first wagon in nearly three decades doesn't disappoint. We test and review the TourX</p>\n<p>I grew up in American station wagons. In the child-ridden Detroit suburbs of the 1970s they were ubiquitous, as common as Sherpa-lined jeans jackets and halter-tops. Nearly every family had one. So it made perfect sense for me to test out the Regal TourX\u2014Buick\u2019s first wagon in nearly a quarter-century\u2014when I was home in Detroit recently to cover the Motor City\u2019s big annual Auto Show. The locale\u2019s combination of hideous winter weather, potholed streets, and familial schlepping duties only enhanced the match of car and place.</p>\n<p>The TourX comes wrapped in a very handsome package, with sneering LED running lights, a tight beltline crease, pressed-in flanks, and a rounded fastback hatchback that are all reminiscent of the class-leading Mercedes-Benz E-Class Estate. All of these design features enunciate the length of the wagon, which is actually quite significant. It\u2019s not only a couple inches longer than the Benz, it\u2019s more than a foot longer than a Volvo V60. In fact, it\u2019s just 2.5-inches shorter than the baleen Porsche Panamera Sport Turismo.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1017\" width=\"1598\" data-delta=\"1\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/inline-1-The-buick-regal-tourx-wagon-is-awesome.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<p>This lovely appearance is marred only by the cheap black plastic trim pasted around the wheel wells. This blight on all-wheel-drive wagons can be traced epidemiologically to the Subaru Outback, but it has now spread virally to nearly everything in the category from the VW Golf AllTrack to the Audi A4 AllRoad. These fender liners work okay in dark colors, like the greenish-grey \u201csmoked pearl metallic\u201d slathered on our test car, but they have a tendency to make the wheel openings look a bit gape-y, an issue that isn\u2019t aided by the psychedelic-pinwheel-screensaver design of the Buick\u2019s rims. Don\u2019t look directly at them while they\u2019re moving, or you\u2019ll end up hypnotized or nauseous.</p>\n<p>The cockpit is far more serene. Not only is it quiet, part of Buick\u2019s commitment to best-in-class noise-mitigation in every vehicle category in which it competes. There\u2019s also a lack of the frenetic and mismatched materials selection that plague so many recent General Motors cars\u2014just a single color of leather with some contrasting stitching, and (fake) wood. Moreover, the actual layout of the controls is sensible and logical, and delightfully analog, with straightforward knobs for things like climate and entertainment systems, a mechanical-feeling shifter for the 8-speed transmission that doesn\u2019t introduce unnecessary guesswork into going from park to reverse to drive, and a simple infotainment touch-screen featuring standard Apple CarPlay (or AndroidAuto.)</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1018\" width=\"1600\" data-delta=\"2\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/inline-2-The-buick-regal-tourx-wagon-is-awesome.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<p>Our tester had the optional $1,000 stereo package, which we\u2019d skip, since all of that is better on our phone and CarPlay mirrors all of that on the screen. It also had nearly $3,000 worth of driver assistance technology, which we\u2019d also probably skip since we know how to drive. We might be tempted by the $1,200 sliding glass panoramic roof, which brings light into the cabin, a near-necessity in the heinous dinge of a Detroit winter. That would drop the list price to under $37,000, which seems like a bargain when you consider items like all-wheel-drive, heated power seats, heated steering wheel, remote start, power liftgate, and a 4G wifi hotspot are all standard.</p>\n<p>The interior is also comfortable, and quite cavernous, especially in the way-back. The long area behind the hatch can swallow things so deeply that you may require an endoscope to reach some of your cargo. And if you power-fold down the rear seats, you\u2019ll end up with enough space for anything a Costco run can throw at you. We think you can easily fit a couple trail bikes back there. It seems like you might even be able to squeeze in a kayak, but we didn\u2019t have a kayak or a tape measure. Anything that won\u2019t fit inside can be strapped up top to the aluminum roof rails.</p>\n<p>All of this wagony goodness weighs things down a bit, so in this 4,200-pound package, the turbocharged four-cylinder engine isn\u2019t exactly an Autobahn-burner. But it\u2019s torquey and potent enough for all of your driving duties, and will kickdown rapidly enough when you floor it to readily handle highway onramp merges, even in Detroit, where everyone cruises above 85 mph. With Blizzak snow tires mounted to the Regal\u2019s mesmeric rims, we were able to plow through anything that the Michigan winter threw at us, which included snow, sleet, ice, freezing rain, and some weird contractions we\u2019d never heard of like, \u201cslew.\u201d Cornering and road-handling is well above average, and surprisingly stable, even with passengers. (My niece giggled quite often as we took on cloverleaves, which is a good sign. She likes to go fast.)</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1018\" width=\"1600\" data-delta=\"3\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/inline-3-The-buick-regal-tourx-wagon-is-awesome.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<p>With the only TourX in America, we also felt kind of special behind the wheel, especially surrounded by our peers in the world of automotive journalism, a community in which wagons are fetishized far beyond their sales numbers. \u201cWere you at the Detroit Institute of Arts yesterday,\u201d one of my peers asked, excitedly, when I ran into him at the motor show. \u201cI saw that TourX wagon parked on the street out front.\u201d</p>\n<p>We imagine that owning a Regal TourX would give an ordinary owner a similar sensation of near-celebrity. Wagons are making a slow but steady comeback, especially among discerning, higher-income buyers. Audi, Volvo, Porsche, and even Jaguar are getting into the game here. In a sea of crossovers and SUVs, instead of being the presumed choice, the wagon is now a way to stand out from the crowd. I just bought a wagon, the VW Golf AllTrack, the only wagon in America with a manual transmission. But if I were looking again, now, this TourX would be on the very shortlist.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1018\" width=\"1600\" data-delta=\"4\" src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/inline-4-The-buick-regal-tourx-wagon-is-awesome.jpg\" />Credit Link:&nbsp;    </p>\n<p><strong>SCORECARD:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Performance:</strong> B+</p>\n<p><strong>Comfort:</strong> A-</p>\n<p><strong>Cargo Capacity:</strong> A</p>\n<p><strong>Lust Factor:</strong> A-</p>\n<p><strong>Overall:</strong> A-</p>\n<p><strong>SPECS:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Price (As Tested):</strong> $35,020 ($41,550)</p>\n<p><strong>Powertrain:</strong> 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-Cylinder 250 hp/295 lb-ft</p>\n<p><strong>Fuel Economy:</strong> 21 city/29 highway/24 combined</p>\n<p><strong>Crossover Compatibility:</strong> Don\u2019t Agonize.

His <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Key_(album)\" target=\"_blank\">Major Key</a> for this was Weight Watchers, and so far, it's working: he lost one pound. Then another one. And\u2026 another one.</p>\n<p>\u201cMan. Weight Watchers is going good,\u201d Khaled told <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2018/02/01/dj-khaled-down-26-pounds-after-joining-weight-watcher/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Page Six</em></a> about the new lifestyle program he both started in December and began repping on <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/weight-loss/dj-khaled-instagram-joins-weight-watchers\">New Year\u2019s Day</a>. \u201cThe freestyle program is doing real big. It\u2019s a real lifestyle because all you have to do is not go over your point [total]. And there are so many zero points [foods] in case you get hungry. I got the freestyle dance.\u201d</p>\n<p>Khaled's never been shy about making his life public, and an Instagram video he posted on January 21 has some details. He's chatting with his personal Weight Watchers coach about his progress, noting that he's down to 266.4 pounds, after starting at 293.</p>\n<iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameBorder=\"0\" src=\"//www.instagram.com/p/BeOUcUKl1By/embed\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<p>But don't say he's \"losing\" weight \u2014 even if he is down almost 26 pounds.</p>\n<p>\"I got rid of \u2013 I don\u2019t lose,\" Khaled told <em>Page Six</em>. \"All I do is win \u2013 you know what I mean.\u201d Yes, yes we do know what you mean.</p>\n<p>But catchphrases aside, Khaled's made some serious progress. He also notes in the video that he weighed 272.2 on January 5, which mean's he's down another 6 pounds or so in the past few weeks.</p>\n<iframe width=\"320\" height=\"320\" frameBorder=\"0\" src=\"//www.instagram.com/p/BdrZw7fFyz-/embed\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<p>Still, Khaled says his goal is to build a healthier lifestyle, not just shed pounds fast.</p>\n<p>\"I'm not in any race to get rid of weight,\" he said in another Instagram post. \"I just want to make sure I stay super focused and continue at being healthy.\"</p>\n<p>If you're looking to drop a few pounds with an easy-to-follow plan, Weight Watchers may actually be a good way to go. As <em>Men\u2019s Health</em> previously explained, Khaled\u2019s freestyle program and other programs under the Weight Watchers system <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/weight-loss/dj-khaled-instagram-joins-weight-watchers\">assign points to different foods</a>, so you don't have to count calories or stick to one regimented diet. The only thing you have to do is stay within your points limit and you\u2019ll likely see change.</p>\n<p>The only risk with commercial diet plans is actually keeping the weight off weeks, months and years down the road. Studies show dieters often have a <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/does-weight-watchers-really-work\">difficult time transitioning</a> from a weight-loss plan to a full-fledged healthy lifestyle. Though, according to at least one study, Weight Watchers may be one of the few plans to buck this trend. In a 2015 study published in the <a href=\"http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2015.303035\" target=\"_blank\">American Public Health Association</a>, pre-diabetics were able to lose 6 percent of their body fat in six months using the plan. They were all able to <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/weight-loss/todd-gonzales-200-pound-weight-loss-transformation\">maintain that weight loss a year later</a>.</p>\n<p>So yeah, there\u2019s hope for Khaled, but here\u2019s our Major Key Alert for him: Make sure to pair this new diet with an equally <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/diet-or-exercise-for-your-heart-health\">healthy exercise regime</a>. Pairing the two will help you kick things up a notch with weight loss, and help protect your heart in totally different ways than food alone.</p>\n<p>And Khaled, if you need a little help we\u2019ve got you covered.

Their meals consisted of seven foods with different calorie loads, and the <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/portion-size\">portion sizes</a> they were served varied each week.</p>\n<p>The researchers discovered that <em data-redactor-tag=\"em\" data-verified=\"redactor\">both</em> groups ate more food when their plates contained more food, lead study author Faris Zuraikat, a graduate student in Penn State\u2019s department of nutritional sciences, told <em data-redactor-tag=\"em\" data-verified=\"redactor\">Men\u2019s Health</em>. This was surprising, because even though the trained group should have eaten less, they couldn\u2019t resist the amount of food that was put in front of them. There was no significant difference in the total volume of food that both groups ate.</p>\n<p>There was a silver lining, though, he says. \u201cThe women who were trained in portion sizes still ate less calories compared to the controls,\u201d Zuraikat explains. \u201cAnd they did not by eating less, but by eating <em data-redactor-tag=\"em\" data-verified=\"redactor\">more</em> of the lower-calorie dense foods and less of the higher-calorie dense foods.\u201d</p>\n<p><em data-redactor-tag=\"em\" data-verified=\"redactor\">7 Foods Doctors Prescribe:</em></p>\n \n <media:content url=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/brightcove-proxy/video/5269486276001/file.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n<p>This particular study didn\u2019t measure whether or not the women lost weight and was likely not long enough to see a direct effect, but past clinical trials support the idea that eating more foods with a lower calorie density can lead to weight loss. People who were told to eat more foods with a lower calorie density, like water-rich <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/delicious-ways-to-eat-vegetables\">vegetables</a>, ate a greater weight of food and felt less hungry, says Rolls.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s because an \u201ceat more\u201d message may be a better approach when it comes to weight loss, says study co-author, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., author of <em data-redactor-tag=\"em\" data-verified=\"redactor\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062060651/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=menshealth06-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0062060651&amp;ascsubtag=%5BASIN%7C0062060651%5Bnid%7C2373356%5Bvid%7C2594096%5Bbrand%7CMH%5Butm%7C\" target=\"_blank\">The Ultimate Volumetrics Diet</a></em>, \u201cResearch finds that people have a tendency to eat a very consistent weight or volume of food, more so than managing calorie intake,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to recognize subtle differences in portion sizes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Plus, \u201cfullness\u201d is heavily weighed by the amount of food you eat, rather than the calories they contain alone, explains Zuraikat. If you can reduce your calorie intake by eating a satisfying amount of food, you can still lose weight.</p>\n<p>Even though the study only included women, the message is completely universal. \u201cMen really like this approach,\u201d says Rolls. \u201cIt makes sense to them, and they like that they can have a full plate of food.\u201d</p>\n<p>They both agree that you don\u2019t need special training to take this approach. The easiest thing you can do is make small changes that add up to a huge difference in your daily calorie intake.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor example, take a sandwich. Go for the whole grain bread for more <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/signs-of-low-fiber-diet\">fiber</a>, go for a leaner cut of meat, manage your spread and choose mustard over mayonnaise,\u201d says Rolls. You\u2019ll eat the same amount of food, but take in fewer calories without even realizing it.</p>\n<p>These 12 <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/weight-loss/easy-foods-swaps-for-weight-loss\">easy foods swaps</a> are a good place to start.</p>]]></description>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title>Chris Pratt Wrestled with the UFC&#039;s Randy Couture, and Everyone Came Out a Winner</title>\n      <link>https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/chris-pratt-randy-couture-wrestling-reunion</link>\n      <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">3023451</guid>\n<pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2018 18:37:09 +0000</pubDate>\n<dcterms:modified>2018-02-01T13:34:16+00:00</dcterms:modified>\n<dc:creator>Jack Crosbie</dc:creator>\n      <description><![CDATA[\n<img src=\"http://www.rodalewire.com/sites/rodalewire.com/files/701/chris-pratt-fight-randy-couture.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" alt=\"chris pratt randy couture fight\" />\n<span class=\"copyright\">Photograph courtesy of Instagram/prattprattpratt</span>\n<p>Couture actually coached Pratt when he was just 17 at an Oregon State wrestling camp</p>\n<p>Chris Pratt is no stranger to the wrestling ring.

For people whose entire livelihoods depend on their bodies, like professional athletes in the MLB, NHL, and NFL, choosing supplements is just part of the job. So how do they do it? They use an app.</p>\n<p>Specifically, they use NSF International's \"<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nsf-certified-for-sport/id489806362?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">Certified for Sport</a>\" app, which functions like a digital encyclopedia of pretty much everything, good or bad, that you can put in your body. The app draws on years of testing and research by NSF International, an independent organization that tests supplements and drugs for harmful ingredients. According to Jon Coyles, the Vice President of Drug, Health and Safety Programs at the MLB, NSF-I is pretty much the \"gold standard\" for what's safe for their athletes to use. In the 2018 season, it's the only standard they'll use.</p>\n<p>Coyles told <em>Men's Health</em> that MLB nutritionists follow a \"food-first\" approach to getting their athletes what they need \u2014 tailoring their diets so most of their nutrients come from food.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe also realize that professional athletes \u2014 there are a large percent of them that are going to use dietary supplements to accomplish a certain goal,\" Coyles said. \"In light of that, and the fact that our athletes are some of the most drug-tested athletes on the face of the planet, if they\u2019re going to choose to use supplements we want to make sure they make educated decisions.\"</p>\n<p>MLB teams actually have a list of 10 categories of supplements they must provide to players, but it's relatively routine stuff: multivitamins, omega 3/ fish oil, probiotics, amino acids, joint aids, protein, and some kind of \"cognitive, sleep, and vision support,\" alongside the energy bars and sports drinks that every athletic competition has. If players want to go outside of that, they have to make sure what they're taking in doesn't contain a banned or unsafe substance.</p>\n<p>In the world of supplements, failing a drug test could actually be considered getting off easy. The supplement market, a <a href=\"https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/01/11/905073/0/en/Global-Dietary-Supplements-Market-will-reach-USD-220-3-Billion-in-2022-Zion-Market-Research.html\" target=\"_blank\">$132.8 billion</a> <a href=\"https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/01/11/905073/0/en/Global-Dietary-Supplements-Market-will-reach-USD-220-3-Billion-in-2022-Zion-Market-Research.html\" target=\"_blank\">business globally</a>, is filled with sketchy products and pills that skirt regulations. In November, NSF discovered that <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/nsf-supplements-toxicology-dangerous-preworkout-dmaa-ephedra\">six commonly-used preworkout supplements</a> contained a banned substance similar to one <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/business/death-after-use-of-jack3d-shows-gap-in-regulation.html\" target=\"_blank\">linked to the death of several soldiers in 2013</a>; other supplements have caused <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/guy-wisdom/ufc-lyman-good-vitamin-shoppe-gaspari-nutrition-steroids\">MMA fighters to fail drug tests without knowing why</a>. <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/health/is-your-supplement-toxic\">This story, about a man who wrecked his liver on a shady muscle-growth supplement</a>, is particularly haunting.</p>\n<p>For more than 10 years, Coyles said, the MLB has been relying on NSF to help prevent mishaps and tragedies alike, but the app just makes it a lot easier. Players can scan the barcode or UPC on any given supplement and check if it's NSF-approved, as well as compare its ingredients to other options. In the MLB, NHL, and Canadian Football League, players are only allowed to take Certified for Sport supplements, and the NFL, PGA, and LPGA recommend it as well.</p>\n<p>Lisa McDowell, the team dietician for the Detroit Red Wings, also told <em>Men's Health</em> that her organization was food-first, but the grueling demands of hockey mean almost every player has some special needs.</p>\n<p>\"Our players are looking to extend their career span as long as possible \u2014 attempting to keep playing into their 40s,\" McDowell said. \"The way they\u2019re doing that is by paying meticulous attention to what they\u2019re putting into their bodies. When food can't do it, we do rely on supplements that we know give us an advantage for the recovery process.\"</p>\n<p>While rehydration is the main key \u2014 McDowell said that players can lose <em>six to eight pounds</em> in water weight in a game \u2014 some players have their own preferences on what else to do to help them bounce back. (To get them hydrated, she loads players up with fresh squeezed juices, protein shakes and other electrolytes during post-game meals.) The NHL is an international league, and players often come from other countries with ideas of what they should be taking (the Fins often swear by saunas and cryotherapy, which aren't a supplement but also aren't for everyone). But in the clubhouse, McDowell says the NHL makes sure that the only products allowed are NSF certified for sport.</p>\n<p>Still, Coyles noted that no nutritionist can completely control their player's consumption. But if they are getting a little something on the side, they're on their own.</p>\n<p>\"Our players are adult men and make their own decisions, but if they go outside that Certified for Sport list they do so at their own risk,\" Coyles said.</p>]]></description>\n    </item>\n  </channel>\n</rss>\n",
