After years of keeping things intentionally cryptic, Vancouver&#039;s Cary Pratt is fully embracing his creative moniker of Prairie Cat with the aptly-titled new album, Prairie Cat Is Cary Pratt. He tells Andrew about how his newfound comfort in the spotlight and behind the mic influenced the composition of this latest album, and some of the other projects that keep him busy - including playing drums with supergroup Mounties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n    <itunes:author>Mike Raine</itunes:author>\n    <itunes:subtitle>JUNOs Return to CBC, Minotaurs, Prairie Cat</itunes:subtitle>\n    <itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit>\n    <itunes:duration>01:02:40</itunes:duration>\n    <itunes:image href=\"https://cdn.zencast.fm/download/Podcast/artworks/1576/large/da3270018b712b8a4b1841f92c26ff067a088a391dc6031610e6300ee261df15/CM%20Radio%20crest%20500x500.jpg\"/>\n    <enclosure url=\"https://media.zencast.fm/canadian-musician-radio/212.mp3?source=feed\" length=\"60153333\" type=\"audio/mp3\"/>\n  </item>\n  <item>\n    <title>CM Radio - May 31, 2017 - Bishop Brigante, Honey Beard, Music BC's Phoenix</title>\n    <dc:creator>Michael Raine</dc:creator>\n    <pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2017 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate>\n    <link>https://media.zencast.fm/canadian-musician-radio/episodes/211</link>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">ad2847de-6a1e-4b6e-b771-8efb4060c827</guid>\n    <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>\n    <description>\n      <![CDATA[ <p>Bishop Brigante is a veteran of Canadian hip-hop and legend in the battle rap world.

And finally, Mike had the chance to speak with LyricFind CEO Darryl Ballantyne at CMW 2017 about some improtant incoming trends in the music industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n    <itunes:author>Mike Raine</itunes:author>\n    <itunes:subtitle> Ascot Royals, Steph Cameron, LyricFind</itunes:subtitle>\n    <itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit>\n    <itunes:duration>00:50:53</itunes:duration>\n    <itunes:image href=\"https://cdn.zencast.fm/download/Podcast/artworks/1576/large/da3270018b712b8a4b1841f92c26ff067a088a391dc6031610e6300ee261df15/CM%20Radio%20crest%20500x500.jpg\"/>\n    <enclosure url=\"https://media.zencast.fm/canadian-musician-radio/206.mp3?source=feed\" length=\"48853390\" type=\"audio/mp3\"/>\n  </item>\n  <item>\n    <title>CM Radio - Apr. 19, 2017 - Eric Ethridge, The Long War, Guitar Workshop Plus</title>\n    <dc:creator>Michael Raine</dc:creator>\n    <pubDate>Wed, 19 Apr 2017 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate>\n    <link>https://media.zencast.fm/canadian-musician-radio/episodes/205</link>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">32030df9-0a25-4265-94f0-fc525ae8ca7f</guid>\n    <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>\n    <description>\n      <![CDATA[ <p>Did you know there's a program where guitarists and other musicians can gather to get first-hand instruction from the likes of Steve Vai, Robben Ford, Alex Lifeson, and many other of the world's top musicians? It's called Guitar Workshop Plus and it was founded right here in Canada. Walter Tavares joins us to talk about the program and how the 2017 guest artist lineup is coming together. Since winning the 2016 CCMA Discovery Program, Eric Ethridge's name has been on a lot of people's tongues. His single \"Liquor's Calling the Shots\" is garnering plenty of attention, and he's had the chance to perform it in some pretty high-profile settings. He talks with Mike about his contemplative and calculated approach to his career - including how he's been handling the incoming interest from record labels and other industry pros. And finally, congratulations to The Long War, who were recently named the winners of CBC's 2017 Searchlight competition. We catch up with the band en route to the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity to talk about their experience in the competition and what's on the horizon - considering they've been together for less than a year.</p> ]]>\n    </description>\n    <itunes:summary>\n      <![CDATA[ <p>Did you know there's a program where guitarists and other musicians can gather to get first-hand instruction from the likes of Steve Vai, Robben Ford, Alex Lifeson, and many other of the world's top musicians?

We'll talk about his work with last year's winner, Desiree Dawson, how artists can best prepare for a studio session, and more.

In many ways, Leger\u2019s artistic path has been leading up to this ambitious display of both sides of his musical personality, fueled by countless nights playing in Toronto bars with a loyal band equally committed to keeping rock and roll\u2019s original flame burning. Apocalipstick is the follow up to The Harpoonist &amp; The Axe Murderer's 2014 release A Real Fine Mess, which received considerable recognition, including a Blues Album of the Year JUNO nod and win for the Blues Album of the Year and Alternative Album of the Year at the WCMAs.

Why did tech companies get subsidized and become extremely rich on the backs of creators and what can now be done about it.

There's easy-to-love indie trio TUNS and the TransCanada Highway Men, a unique project where he, ex-Barenaked Lady Steven Page, Mo Berg of The Pursuit of Happiness, and Odds lead man Craig Northey trade off songs from their well-known catalogues. He touches on all of this and lets us in on the secrets of how he does it all. Plus, A Fat Wreck is a documentary about iconic punk label Fat Wreck Chords.

The new album was written in his cozy Mile End flat, in a 10-foot by 10-foot room with a perfect view of Mont-Royal, and a little piano in it hauled over from Halifax, on which many of the songs were composed. Isaiah had never taken this approach before, but through it he found chords that he wouldn\u2019t have on his usual guitar. And though writing the songs took considerable time, not much rehearsing or preparation went into recording them. The looseness of the recordings works so well precisely because the songs are so well crafted. We also catch up with 3/4 of the bill for the April 2nd edition of Generation Next Live at The Phoenix in Toronto in electro-rock four-piece DLV, alt quartet The Control Room, and upbeat indie pop trio Goodnight, Sunrise.

The brainchild of frontman and pricipal songwriter Cary Pratt, Prairie Cat is fresh off the release of Who Knows Where To Begin? The touring band features a few familiar faces from the west coast music community and we'll chat with Cary about his songs and how they come to life on the stage. As for Shimmering Stars, they're even fresher off the release of their second and latest LP, Bedrooms of the Nation. The album integrates elements from across the pop, noise, punk, and experimental spectrums - The Pixies, Flipper, Yo La Tengo, Women, and Nirvana running head into The Beach Boys, Phil Spector, and 50s/60s AM radio. Finally, the cats in Coyote have their first full-length dropping in the coming weeks, and in addition to the unique sound they've crafted, we'll speak about their adventures as a band thus far - which most recently included the theft and recovery of close to $10,000 worth of musical equipment.</p> ]]>\n    </description>\n    <itunes:summary>\n      <![CDATA[ <p>It's indie pop week for Canadian Musician Radio, and we're reaching from sea to sea for this one.

The album title even is a big part of the story here - a symbol of Afie taking ownership of the name Bahamas. It\u2019s a self titled record of sorts, that for lack of a better term is kind of a revealing moment in his career which has come with some high acclaim both here in Canada and the US and overseas. The music is expansive, thoughtful, full of huge catchy hooks that are at the same time beautiful and a really fun listen. He also unleashes some incredible guitar playing to boot. Be sure to keep an eye for that... We've also got an interview with Nathan Gill, frontman of Charlottetown rock outfit The North Lakes, talking about the band's in-the-works third release. They've had a busy summer, performing tracks from 2012's stellar Grand Prix at fests like Evolve and Big Red Music Festival. And on that note, we also catch up with Jeff Squires and Alex Douglas, two of the organizers behind Big Red Music Festival, which this year brought massive acts like The Killers, Death Cab For Cutie, Marianas Trench, Sam Roberts Band, and Lights to Canada's smallest province.

With all of these great summer festivals and tours, we've been able to deliver a heap of artist interviews, and this week is no different. Join us as we catch up with Juno-winning six-piece \"folk popgrass\" outfit The Strumbellas, singer-songwriter Astrid Young (also the half-sister of the one and only Neil), and Ryan McCambridge. The Strumbellas are playing summer festivals across Canada and the U.S. this summer, continuing to promote the sophomore album, We Still Move Dance Floors. While its predecessor, My Father and the Hunter, was nominated for a Juno Award for Roots &amp; Traditional Album of the Year in 2013,We Still Move Dance Floors actually took the trophy earlier in 2014 and was recently long-listed for the 2014 Polaris Music Prize. They're more focused than ever now, and we'll find out why. Musician, composer, actor, author screenwriter, and sommelier Astrid Young released her fourth solo record, One Night at Giant Rock, at the end of June. In a special performance, Young is kicking off her \"psychedelic acid folk\" tour in southern Ontario in late July and will work her way west. The album, featuring Victor DeLorenzo of the Violent Femmes is a collection of songs that reflect her personal discovery of the karmic meaning of all her relationships. She speaks about the long gaps between records, some of her other musical endeavors, and more. Finally, in addition to being a studio engineer who's been the right hand man of producer/engineer David Bottrill (Peter Gabriel, Tool, Dream Theater), Ryan McCambridge has been making music under the moniker of A Calmer Collision. We talk about the sonic balance he's struck between modern rock and electronica as well as how his experience in the studio informs his work as a musician and more.</p> ]]>\n    </description>\n    <itunes:summary>\n      <![CDATA[ <p>Another Wednesday, another edition of Canadian Musician Radio.

While its predecessor, My Father and the Hunter, was nominated for a Juno Award for Roots &amp; Traditional Album of the Year in 2013,We Still Move Dance Floors actually took the trophy earlier in 2014 and was recently long-listed for the 2014 Polaris Music Prize. They're more focused than ever now, and we'll find out why. Musician, composer, actor, author screenwriter, and sommelier Astrid Young released her fourth solo record, One Night at Giant Rock, at the end of June. In a special performance, Young is kicking off her \"psychedelic acid folk\" tour in southern Ontario in late July and will work her way west. The album, featuring Victor DeLorenzo of the Violent Femmes is a collection of songs that reflect her personal discovery of the karmic meaning of all her relationships. She speaks about the long gaps between records, some of her other musical endeavors, and more. Finally, in addition to being a studio engineer who's been the right hand man of producer/engineer David Bottrill (Peter Gabriel, Tool, Dream Theater), Ryan McCambridge has been making music under the moniker of A Calmer Collision. We talk about the sonic balance he's struck between modern rock and electronica as well as how his experience in the studio informs his work as a musician and more.</p> ]]>\n    </itunes:summary>\n    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Another Wednesday, another edition of Canadian Musician Radio.

This week, we're happy to bring you a special interview with a true Canadian music icon, Roch Voisine. He's fresh off of the release of an all-English greatest hits collection, \"My Very Best,\" which also features four new tracks, including \"Living Out My Dreams\" - the Canadian Olympic Committee's anthem for the 2014 Winter Games. His career of entertaining audiences in two languages spans more than 25 years, so Mike had plenty to ask about during their conversation. Also, we've got Anthem/SRO Management's Tyler Tasson on the episode.

What's more, we also have a candid conversation with music publicist and Canadian industry icon Richard Flohil, plus some goodies from East Coast Music Week 2014 and more. The founder of Richard Flohil &amp; Associates has been an instrumental component to the careers of a plethora of successful artists, from k.d. lang and Colin James to Serena Ryder and Justin Rutledge and well beyond. He's received numerous awards and honours from the likes of SOCAN, the CASBYs, and was just named the recipient of the 2014 President's Choice Award from Folk Music Ontario. Join us as we take a look back at Richard's decades in the business. Then, we'll catch up with Dallas Smith who, after 10 years fronting Canadian rock outfit Default, has released a solo country EP called \"Tippin Point.\" We'll talk about the transition from one genre to the other and get some insight into his creative process, among other things. We're also very pleased to have Maritimer Meaghan Smith on the program. After a JUNO win for her major label debut, The Cricket's Orchestra, Smith took a few years off to prepare her next release, Have A Heart, set to drop April 22nd. The single of the same name is out now and doing very well at radio. We'll get the scoop from Meaghan on her sonic shift, upcoming affairs, and a whole lot more.

We chat about the band's success on radio, their tours with the likes of Alice in Chains, Deep Purple, Buckcherry, and The Sheepdogs, and what it's like pushing into new territories. We're also happy to have Nick Whitehouse on the show, who designs the ligthing looks for major tours by artists like Kanye West, Jay Z, and Beyonce. Most recently, he took on the design for Justin Timberlake's 20/20 Experience tour, which Mike had the chance to see (lucky fella). We speak with Nick about some of the things that go into a design for a show of this magnitude - a cool look \"behind the scenes,\" or more fittingly, \"above the stage.\" And in our International Artist Spotlight, we'll hear a track from U.K. synth/new wave outfit Jupiter in Velvet. The band lists acts like Bowie, Duran Duran, and The Killers among its influences, and there's a good reason why.

On Dec. 25th, we revisited some of the highlights of our first year, including interviews with major names like Avril Lavigne, Metric, Blue Rodeo, The Tragically Hip, and many others. Then, on January 1st, our show looked back at some of the \"on the rise\" acts we spoke with in 2013 that we think are going to make an impact in 2014. For this week's show, we've got our Jan/Feb 2014 cover artists, The Trews, talking about the making of their fifth full-length record. You can get the full story in our feature article when the issue drops, but listen in for some additional info on the recording, their work with Gavin Brown, and more. It's a double dose of East Coast artists, as we'll also be speaking with the very young and very talented Molly Thomason, whose new album \"Columbus Field\" is sure to turn some heads - especially for fans of Tegan and Sara, Sleater Kinney, and Neko Case.
