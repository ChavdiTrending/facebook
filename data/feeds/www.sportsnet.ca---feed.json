Credit Korean goaltender Matt Dalton, a naturalized citizen born in Clifton, Ont., for standing on his head, but it\u2019s not like Carey Price suddenly bailed on the NHL and settled in Seoul.</p>\n<p>Early in the second period, the Koreans were a bounce away from tying things up 1-1 and nearly did when a dump-in took a strange bounce off boards right to the slot, where Derek Roy needed to swipe it away from Shin Sanghoon.</p>\n<p>Backup Kevin Poulin, starting in place of Ben Scrivens, had to make a couple of strong saves, one during a Mason Raymond double minor for high-sticking on Kim Sangwook in the slot, and another on a cross-ice feed to Ahn Jin Hui.</p>\n<p>The Canadians were sluggish and disinterested for a good portion of the second, going more than six minutes without a shot to open the stanza after outshooting the Koreans 18-5 in the first.</p>\n<p>But O\u2019Dell killed the upset hopes of a boisterous crowd at Gangneung Hockey Centre that cheered every Korean touch of the puck like it was a goal at 14:22 of the second, picking up the rebound of a Marc-Andre Gragnani shot off the boards and tucking into an empty net.</p>\n<p>Lapierre\u2019s goal through Dalton\u2019s legs after a coast-to-coast rush made 3-0 at 3:47 of the third was another dagger and Lapierre closed things out at 18:02 but Canada had reason to run up the score in the event it needed a tiebreaker.</p>\n<p>The Czech Republic secured top spot in Group A earlier in the day with a 4-1 win over Switzerland, advancing directly to the quarter-finals along with Group B winner Russia and Group C winner Sweden, which beat Finland 3-1 winner Sunday night.</p>\n<p>That gave Canada the fourth and final direct spot in the quarter-finals, with the other eight teams playing in the qualification playoffs Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Credit to the Koreans for keeping it respectably, especially after an 8-0 loss to Switzerland which prompted forward Michael Swift, another of their seven naturalized foreigners, to say, &#34;it was embarrassing. Nobody wanted to play, it looked like.\u201d</p>\n<p>The nascent hockey program run by former NHL defenceman Jim Paek looked like that at points in the first, when their plan appeared to be let Dalton stop everything and ice the puck when possible, but played with more life over the final 40 minutes.</p>\n<p>The Canadians were merciless in the first period, outshooting the Olympic hosts 18-5, but only managed to beat Dalton once when Thomas took a clever stretch pass from Chay Genoway, got to the top of the slot and ripped a laser beam into the top corner at 7:36.</p>\n<p>The goal came on Canada\u2019s 14th shot.</p>\n<p>Wojtek Wolski could easily have had two goals in the period, having one puck dribble just wide while tucking a forehand/backhand deke on a short-handed breakaway off the side of the net.</p>\n<p>Canada was without Andrew Ebbett suffered what he called a charley horse late in the 3-2 shootout loss to the Czech Republic, but he finished the game and said afterwards he was fine. Quinton Howden, scratched Saturday, took his spot in the lineup.</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Olympics</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues>\n\t\t\t<league>Olympic men's hockey</league>\n\t\t</leagues>\n\n\t\t<teams/>\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/beaulieu-marchand_alex.jpg\" />\n<media:credit>Jonathan Hayward/CP</media:credit>\n<media:title>beaulieu-marchand_alex</media:title>\n<media:text>Alex Beaulieu-Marchand</media:text>\n<enclosure url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/beaulieu-marchand_alex.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t\t<title>Canadian Alex Beaulieu-Marchand wins bronze in men&#8217;s ski slopestyle</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.sportsnet.ca/olympics/canadian-alex-beaulieu-marchand-wins-bronze-mens-ski-slopestyle/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.sportsnet.ca/olympics/canadian-alex-beaulieu-marchand-wins-bronze-mens-ski-slopestyle//#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 00:39:50 EST</pubDate>\n\t\t<modifiedDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 01:02:19 EST</modifiedDate >\n\t\t<dc:creator>Canadian Press</dc:creator>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\"><![CDATA[https://www.sportsnet.ca/?post_type=sn-article&#038;p=3893575&#038;oc=-1]]></guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Quebec&#8217;s Alex Beaulieu-Marchand took home a bronze medal in the men&#8217;s ski slopestyle event on Day 9 at Pyeongchang 2018. </p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>BOKWANG, Korea, Republic Of &#8212; Canadian freestyle skier Alex Beaulieu-Marchand has won a bronze medal in men&#8217;s slopestyle at the Pyeonghcang Olympics.</p>\n<p>    The skier from Quebec City scored 92.40 on his second run.</p>\n<p>    Norway&#8217;s Oystein Braaten won gold with a 95.00 on his first run.</p>\n<p>    American Nick Goepper finished second after scoring 93.60 in his final run to bump Beaulieu-Marchand out of the silver-medal position.</p>\n<p>    In slopestyle, each skier has three runs down a course featuring rails and jumps.

Therefore, the IOC cannot communicate on individual cases while the procedure is still ongoing,&#34; the IOC said in a statement. &#34;However, we take note of the statement by a spokesperson of the Olympic Athlete from Russia (OAR) delegation.&#34;</p>\n<p>    The IOC added that &#34;if the case is confirmed, it will be considered&#34; by the IOC body which would be considering whether to reinstate Russia.</p>\n<p>    The Court of Arbitration for Sport, which rules on Olympic doping cases, said it had not received any notification.</p>\n<p>    &#34;No new case received and no rumours of it so far,&#34; Matthieu Reeb, the court&#8217;s secretary general, said in an email.</p>\n<p>    As part of IOC sanctions for Russian doping at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, athletes from the country had to undergo IOC vetting including an examination of their drug-testing history before being invited to the Olympics. Dozens were rejected.</p>\n<p>    The IOC suspended the national Olympic committee, meaning that Russian athletes are competing in neutral uniforms under the Olympic flag in Pyeongchang. The IOC has said Russia could be reinstated for the closing ceremony if it follows IOC rules, including anti-doping regulations.</p>\n<p>    The only other doping case so far at the Pyeongchang Olympics came when Japanese short-track speedskater Kai Saito tested positive for a banned diuretic and was removed from competition.

Absolutely amazing,&#34; Federer said. &#34;The goal was to make the semis and I won the tournament so of course I&#8217;m incredibly excited and so, so happy.&#34;</p>\n<p>    The 36-year-old Swiss extended his domination over the player once dubbed &#34;Baby Fed&#34; for the similarities in their playing style, registering his seventh victory in as many meetings.</p>\n<p>    Federer&#8217;s third title at the Rotterdam tournament comes a day before he officially returns to the top of the rankings, more than five years after he was last world No. 1.</p>\n<p>    He will become the oldest person to hold the No. 1 position when the rankings are updated on Monday. It&#8217;s been more than five years since Federer was last No. 1, and 14 years since he first reached the top spot.</p>\n<p>    Federer, who has 20 Grand Slams to his name, said his next target is 100 career titles. He moved a step closer Sunday.</p>\n<p>    Federer said ahead of the final that the more aggressive player would win and Dimitrov started the strongest, winning his first game to love as he slammed powerful forehands and backhands past Federer.</p>\n<p>    But the Swiss great quickly started matching Dimitrov&#8217;s groundstrokes and converted his first break point in the fifth game. Federer broke Dimitrov again to go up 5-2 and then served out the set.</p>\n<p>    Federer kept the pressure on Dimitrov in the second set, breaking the Bulgarian in the first game and continuing to dominate on his way to victory in just 55 minutes.</p>\n<p>    Federer won a massive 82 per cent of points on his service compared to 55 per cent for Dimitrov.</p>\n<p>    After his strong start, the Bulgarian appeared to be struggling physically, but said afterward that he simply wasn&#8217;t good enough.</p>\n<p>    &#34;Against Roger in the current situation he is in you can&#8217;t play any less than 100 per cent,&#34; Dimitrov said.</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Tennis</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues>\n\t\t\t<league>ATP</league>\n\t\t</leagues>\n\n\t\t<teams/>\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tanev.jpg\" />\n<media:credit>Darryl Dyck/CP</media:credit>\n<media:title>tanev</media:title>\n<media:text>Chris Tanev.

Though that sum isn&#8217;t putting Tanev in the running for a Norris Trophy, it is enough to match the best points-per-game pace of the eight-year veteran&#8217;s career.</p>\n<p>The long-time Canuck has two more seasons left on his five-year deal, carrying a cap hit of $4.45 million and a modified no-trade clause, according to <a href=\"https://www.capfriendly.com/players/christopher-tanev\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CapFriendly</a>.</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Hockey</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues>\n\t\t\t<league>NHL</league>\n\t\t</leagues>\n\t\t<teams>\n\t\t\t<team>VAN</team>\n\t\t</teams>\n\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1704050871_5735897269001_5735888931001-vs.jpg\" />\n<media:title>1704050871_5735897269001_5735888931001-vs</media:title>\n<enclosure url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1704050871_5735897269001_5735888931001-vs.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t\t<title>Trotz speaks out on fans&#8217; racially charged taunting of Smith-Pelly</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/trotz-speaks-fans-racially-charged-taunting-smith-pelly/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/trotz-speaks-fans-racially-charged-taunting-smith-pelly//#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 01:18:31 EST</pubDate>\n\t\t<modifiedDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 01:18:31 EST</modifiedDate >\n\t\t<dc:creator>Sonny Sachdeva</dc:creator>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\"><![CDATA[https://www.sportsnet.ca/?post_type=sn-article&#038;p=3893611&#038;oc=-1]]></guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Head coach Barry Trotz spoke out in defence of Washington Capitals winger Devante Smith-Pelly on Saturday after fans were removed from the United Center for launching racial taunts at the forward.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Amid an ugly 7-1 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks on Saturday, the Washington Capitals emerged from the tilt the less embarrassed of the two organizations after four fans were removed from Chicago&#8217;s United Center for shouting racial taunts at <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/devante-smith-pelly/554489\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"554489\">Devante Smith-Pelly</a> while the winger sat in the visitor&#8217;s penalty box.</p>\n<p>Per <em>Washington Post</em> reporter Isabelle Khurshudyan, fans sitting near the penalty box shouted &#8220;basketball, basketball, basketball&#8221; at Smith-Pelly, before exchanging words with the visibly upset forward.

Since having a bit of time off at the all-star break, I think we&#8217;ve been able to come back hard knowing we really can&#8217;t afford to be leaving points out there.&#34;</p>\n<p>    Florida went into the league&#8217;s four-day break 12 points out of a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. They&#8217;ve cut the margin in half, now trailing the New York Islanders and the second wild card spot by six points.</p>\n<p>    &#34;Guys are playing like it&#8217;s our playoffs right now,&#34; said Panthers coach Bob Boughner. &#34;We&#8217;ve got to just keep digging in and getting as many points as we can right now. We&#8217;re still in the thick of it and we have some games at hand.&#34;</p>\n<p>    The beneficiary of the offensive barrage was goaltender Roberto Luongo. In his first appearance since suffering a groin injury on Dec. 4, the 38-year-old made 30 saves.</p>\n<p>    &#34;Still not quite as sharp as I want to be, but for the first game back I thought it was pretty good,&#34; said Luongo, who won his first game since Nov. 27.</p>\n<p>    Evgenii Dadonov and Vincent Trocheck had a goal and an assist each for Florida (26-23-6). Jared McCann also scored as the Panthers win their fifth straight game on the road. They continue their current five-game road trip in Winnipeg on Sunday.</p>\n<p>    Dougie Hamilton had his first career hat trick, supplying all the offence for Calgary (30-21-8). It was the first three-goal game by a Flames defenceman since Al Macinnis in 1992.</p>\n<p>    &#34;Obviously a cool thing to do, but tough in a game like that,&#34; said Hamilton, playing in his 400th NHL game. &#34;I&#8217;ve had two goals before and you always say to yourself, well maybe there&#8217;s a chance you can score a hat trick, but never did it. The last one I had that I remember was minor hockey. It&#8217;s been a while.&#34;</p>\n<p>    The NHL&#8217;s second-best team on the road (17-7-5) and having just completed a successful 4-2-0 road trip, the Flames&#8217; woes on home ice continue. Calgary is winless in its last six (0-3-3) and falls to 13-14-3 on the season.</p>\n<p>    &#34;What happened tonight is what everybody fears and talks about,&#34; said coach Glen Gulutzan. &#34;You come home from a road trip, you have a successful road trip, your first game back and every guy didn&#8217;t have enough to get us through this game.&#34;</p>\n<p>    Tied 1-1 after the first period, Florida blew the game open in the second with three goals in the opening seven minutes.</p>\n<p>    The decisive blows were back-to-back power-play goals just over two minutes apart.</p>\n<p>    At 58 seconds, Trocheck completed a give-and-go with Barkov by slipping a shot past rookie goaltender David Rittich. Then with Barkov providing the screen, Dadonov deflected in Keith Yandle&#8217;s shot.</p>\n<p>    &#34;We just weren&#8217;t executing,&#34; summed up Flames captain Mark Giordano. &#34;It felt like we were a little bit off right from the start of the game.&#34;</p>\n<p>    On the final shot Rittich would face before being pulled, Barkov made it 4-1 at 6:03, redirecting Dadonov&#8217;s shot between the pads of the 25-year-old Czech.</p>\n<p>    Making his third consecutive start in the absence of injured starter Mike Smith (lower body), Rittich had 11 stops on 15 shots. Jon Gillies was beaten twice on 15 shots in relief.</p>\n<p>    <b>Notes:</b> It was Rittich&#8217;s first start at home after his first nine starts came on the road&#8230; Smith skated before his team&#8217;s game-day skate Saturday morning. His status remains day-to-day&#8230; Johnny Gaudreau&#8217;s eight-game scoring streak (4-7-11) was snapped&#8230; Ekblad extended his point-streak to six games (3-5-8).</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Hockey</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues>\n\t\t\t<league>NHL</league>\n\t\t</leagues>\n\t\t<teams>\n\t\t\t<team>CGY</team>\n\t\t\t<team>FLA</team>\n\t\t</teams>\n\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18528332.jpg\" />\n<media:credit>Matt Slocum/AP</media:credit>\n<media:title>Pyeongchang Olympics Ice Hockey Women</media:title>\n<enclosure url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18528332.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t\t<title>Canada staying focused on semi-final after 4-day break</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.sportsnet.ca/olympics/canada-staying-focussed-semi-final-4-day-break/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.sportsnet.ca/olympics/canada-staying-focussed-semi-final-4-day-break//#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 11:17:31 EST</pubDate>\n\t\t<modifiedDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 11:20:07 EST</modifiedDate >\n\t\t<dc:creator>Kristina Rutherford</dc:creator>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\"><![CDATA[https://www.sportsnet.ca/?post_type=sn-article&#038;p=3893771&#038;oc=-1]]></guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The province of Nova Scotia hangs around Jill Saulnier\u2019s neck, a silver outline of where she grew up that you\u2019ll find on a long silver chain her dad gave her, a necklace she never takes off.

A second necklace reads: \u201cDream big.\u201d</p>\n<p>Saulnier, who\u2019s from Halifax, is among eight rookies on Team Canada, and just two games in, the 25-year-old made history. In Canada\u2019s win over Finland, the winger became the first-ever player from Nova Scotia to score a goal at the Olympic Games. It was a beauty, too, coming on a breakaway as she beat Finland\u2019s Noora Raty, stick side.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe puck is on my night stand, so I can see it,\u201d said Saulnier, grinning, and a member of the team\u2019s staff labelled it \u2018First Olympic Goal.\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s awesome.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course, Saulnier, who has a goal and an assist through three games here while skating on the right side with a couple of veteran linemates in Rebecca Johnston and Brianne Jenner, isn\u2019t focused on her own accolades. She just can\u2019t wait to get back on that Olympic ice.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a few days,\u201d she said, since Canada\u2019s last game, a 2-1 win over the rival Americans on Thursday. \u201cAnd we have another practice [on Sunday] before we get to play again.\u201d</p>\n<p>On Monday, Canada will take on the Olympic Athletes of Russia in one semi-final, while Team USA meets Finland in the other. It\u2019s a rematch on both sides. Canada beat Russia handily, 5-0, on Day 3.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re expecting a good game,\u201d said forward Melodie Daoust, who co-leads Canada in the points department, with four (3g, 1a). \u201cVery physical, we saw it in the first game. They\u2019re a great team and we have to respect their talent.\u201d  </p>\n<p>Johnston, who also paces this team with four points, says they\u2019re using the days off to improve in a couple areas, particularly in their own end. There were more than a few breakdowns when Canada faced the Americans, a game they won only thanks to exceptional goaltending from Genevieve Lacasse.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re confident, but we want to keep building from the games in the past,\u201d said Johnston, the two-time Olympic gold medallist. \u201cI think we could play a little bit better than we did last game against the U.S. We need to tighten up a couple things in the D-zone, so we\u2019re going to learn from that and get better.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the message across the board if you talk to players or to head coach Laura Schuler. Sure, there are a bunch of days off between games &#8212; four, between their last round robin tilt and this semi-final &#8212; but the reigning Olympic champions are using them wisely.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe definitely want to be a team that continues to improve every single time we\u2019re on the ice,\u201d Schuler said, after Friday\u2019s practice. \u201cThese next two days are really important to us, so that\u2019s where our focus is on, what we need to do to be better today in today\u2019s practice\u2026for us it\u2019s another day to keep going.\u201d</p>\n<p>The players have been using any down time to recover, to get treatment and massages. They also took in the men\u2019s shootout loss against the Czech Republic, Saulnier cheered on Patrick Chan in figure skating, and they\u2019ve had an intense ping pong game or two going in the village. \u201cI lost to Rebecca [Johnston],\u201d Saulnier said. \u201cDon\u2019t put that in the press.\u201d</p>\n<p>The best part of this experience, players all agree, are as Daoust put it, \u201cthe first game, the second game, the third game.\u201d Of course, it\u2019s the fifth game Team Canada is really gearing up for, when they\u2019ll in all likelihood take on their North American rivals in the gold medal final, as they always do on this stage.</p>\n<p>Not that you\u2019ll get any member of the Canadian team that\u2019s going for a fifth straight Olympic title to look that far ahead. It\u2019s all clich\u00e9s at this point: \u201cOne day at a time,\u201d Saulnier said.</p>\n<p>And, happily, this Canadian team is edging closer to their next test.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re always excited to play,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working towards this for a long time. It\u2019s been six months of hard training leading up to this Olympics. Finally, to be here and experience it with my teammates, it\u2019s an amazing feeling.\u201d </p>\n<p>For Saulnier, a first-timer here, teammates like Johnston and Jenner have been valuable resources in showing herself and the other rookies the ropes, \u201cmaking sure we\u2019re not too excited and running around the village with excitement,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>The biggest challenge so far here for this proud Nova Scotian &#8212; there\u2019s a heart over Halifax on that necklace she wears &#8212; has been exactly what she expected it would be.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to tame the excitement,\u201d she said, grinning. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to get back out there.\u201d</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Olympics</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues/>\n\t\t<teams/>\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/hosmer_eric.jpg\" />\n<media:credit>Colin E.

Still, there\u2019s concern that lesser players are frozen out.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>DUNEDIN, Fla. \u2013 In recent weeks, some agents and executives downplayed concern about an exceptionally slow-moving off-season with speculation that <a href=\"/baseball/mlb/players/eric-hosmer/454349\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"454349\">Eric Hosmer</a> had a substantial offer in hand.</p>\n<p>The eight-year, $144-million agreement Hosmer now has with the <a href=\"/baseball/mlb/teams/san-diego-padres/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"san-diego-padres\" data-league=\"mlb\">San Diego Padres</a> represents the biggest deal of the winter, and suggests that teams are indeed willing to spend on elite players. Still, there\u2019s concern that lesser players are frozen out, especially once they start aging.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt&#8217;s like Hollywood,\u201d one agent said recently. \u201cYou&#8217;ve got these leading players making a [boat]load of money and extras making the minimum.\u201d</p>\n<p>To that point, <a href=\"/baseball/mlb/players/fernando-abad/393032\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"393032\">Fernando Abad</a> accepted a minor-league deal Saturday and many other established free agents will have to follow suit if they want contracts. Many star players remain unsigned, too, but commissioner Rob Manfred said recently that teams are acting in accordance with the CBA.</p>\n<p>If anything, Manfred suggested, Scott Boras might be responsible for the slow off-season pace. Without naming names, Manfred called out Boras, who represents Hosmer as well as <a href=\"/baseball/mlb/players/j-d-martinez/502044\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"502044\">J.D. Martinez</a>, <a href=\"/baseball/mlb/players/mike-moustakas/388370\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"388370\">Mike Moustakas</a>, <a href=\"/baseball/mlb/players/jake-arrieta/389721\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"389721\">Jake Arrieta</a> and <a href=\"/baseball/mlb/players/greg-holland/389859\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"389859\">Greg Holland</a>.</p>\n<p>\u201cDrawing lines in the sand based on a perception that your market value is something different than what the market is telling you your value is, that doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense,\u201d Manfred said. \u201cIt is a fact that markets dictate value. Values are not dictated by big, thick, three-ring binders and rhetoric about who\u2019s better than whom. They\u2019re dictated by markets. That\u2019s the system we negotiated.\u201d</p>\n<p>Just as there was speculation about Hosmer\u2019s offers, some speculate that Arrieta and Martinez have nine-figure deals available. They might not be as lucrative as the ones Boras initially sought, but then GMs aren\u2019t in the habit of handing out contracts recklessly anymore.</p>\n<p>That means agents must adjust expectations to align with what teams value. Some players, like <a href=\"/baseball/mlb/players/tyler-chatwood/456036\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"456036\">Tyler Chatwood</a>, earn more now than they would have a decade ago. Many others will earn less. If the likes of Arrieta and Martinez do land generous contracts, then some of the concern about this slow-developing market would disappear.</p>\n<p>Really, though, this is a big-picture question that can\u2019t be answered by any one data point, whether it\u2019s a lucrative deal like Hosmer\u2019s or a team-friendly deal like the two-year, $17-million contract signed by <a href=\"/baseball/mlb/players/todd-frazier/389301\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"389301\">Todd Frazier</a> and the <a href=\"/baseball/mlb/teams/new-york-mets/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"new-york-mets\" data-league=\"mlb\">New York Mets</a>. Until the final numbers are in, we\u2019re dealing with incomplete information.</p>\n<p>To this point, <a href=\"/baseball/mlb/players/curtis-granderson/202398\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"202398\">Curtis Granderson</a>\u2019s not outwardly concerned. Granderson holds the highest elected position possible for a union member as one of two MLBPA Association Player Representatives and he struck a diplomatic tone when asked about the market this week. </p>\n<p>\u201cEverything is still moving up. Revenue is at an all-time high. Minimum salaries are at an all-time high,\u201d Granderson said. \u201cThe reason those things get a chance to go up is because of the talent that you put out on the field, and what that talent does to bring people want to buy your jerseys and want to buy your hats and want to pay for tickets to come to the game. As long as everything continues to move in the right direction, in the same direction, I think it\u2019s going to be a good thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>That may be so, but free agency has long been the reward for six years of big-league time. Now some players see an unforgiving market and are happy to avoid it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d said <a href=\"/baseball/mlb/players/marco-estrada/291479\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"291479\">Marco Estrada</a>, who signed a one-year extension with the Blue Jays last September instead of testing free agency. \u201cI\u2019m blessed and happy that I was able to take care of that stuff early so I had none of those headaches and none of the stress about where I was going to end up. It was really nice to enjoy this off-season.\u201d</p>\n<p>In years past, free agents enjoyed the off-season by cashing in with big-ticket deals. That some are now happy to avoid free agency suggests that there\u2019s still reason for concern on the player side, even after Hosmer\u2019s massive deal.</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Baseball</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues>\n\t\t\t<league>MLB</league>\n\t\t</leagues>\n\t\t<teams>\n\t\t\t<team>NYM</team>\n\t\t\t<team>SD</team>\n\t\t</teams>\n\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/tomas-plekanec.jpg\" />\n<media:credit>Paul Chiasson/CP</media:credit>\n<media:title>tomas plekanec</media:title>\n<media:text>Montreal Canadiens' Tomas Plekanec celebrates after scoring the winning goal to defeat the New Jersey Devils in overtime during NHL hockey action Thursday, December 14, 2017 in Montreal.

Here&#8217;s a look at what each player is worth.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Heading into the NHL\u2019s trade deadline, the market is loaded with top-line wingers like Evander Kane and Rick Nash, along with slightly less likely to be traded players with term like Mike Hoffman and Max Pacioretty. But one area we haven\u2019t heard much about is the centre position.</p>\n<p>For the most part, it\u2019s unlikely to see any top two-line centres moved at the deadline in any year, especially since Matt Duchene and Kyle Turris have already been moved for each other.</p>\n<p>Two centres whose names have come up a bit are <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/tomas-plekanec/172738\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"172738\">Tomas Plekanec</a>, on an expiring contract, and <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/jean-gabriel-pageau/610574\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"610574\">Jean-Gabriel Pageau</a>, who has term left at a reasonable cap hit of $3.1 million. Both players occupy the same role on their team: checking centre on the third line. However it\u2019s doubtful that the same team would be interested in both.</p>\n<p>The reason for that comes down to age and contract. Pageau would be a player to acquire for a long time, and as such would likely cost much more, while Plekanec is a pure rental. Ignoring contract status though, what is each player worth?</p>\n<p>Neither of them will be acquired for their offence, so let\u2019s look specifically at each player\u2019s defensive impact compared to their team\u2019s average.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PageauPlekanec-defence.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3893911\" /></p>\n<p>Despite Carey Price\u2019s poor numbers this year, the <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/montreal-canadiens/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"montreal-canadiens\" data-league=\"nhl\">Montreal Canadiens</a>\u2019 shot locations against are relatively good, and while Plekanec is on the ice, they\u2019re even better.</p>\n<p>The Canadiens have fewer rebounds recovered by opponents when Plekanec is on as well, but that isn\u2019t a direct cause of him being on those loose pucks, he recovers less than average, it\u2019s due to fewer rebounds occurring overall.</p>\n<p>Plekanec is heavily involved in puck battles in the defensive zone, but his win rate is nothing that special, about right on team average. The extra involvement matters though, even lost puck battles are better than not engaging and hoping things work out.</p>\n<p>The biggest weakness Plekanec has defensively is how many passes to the slot occur when he\u2019s on the ice, it\u2019s more than team average, which could have something to do with the level of competition he plays, but both at even strength and shorthanded, Plekanec can be victimized by passing. That could be due to losing a bit of his typical short-burst acceleration as he\u2019s aged, so it\u2019s tougher for him to stay in lanes than it used to be.</p>\n<p>Pageau isn\u2019t having as strong of a defensive year as Plekanec is, with the <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/ottawa-senators/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"ottawa-senators\" data-league=\"nhl\">Ottawa Senators</a> giving up more high-danger chances and passes to the slot while he\u2019s on the ice, meaning their goaltenders are facing higher shot quality when the defensive centre is on.</p>\n<p>Like the Canadiens with Plekanec, the Senators see fewer rebounds recovered by opponents when Pageau is on the ice, but it\u2019s not necessarily him personally recovering them.</p>\n<p>Where Pageau does stand out from the pack is his puck battle involvement and win rate. He\u2019s engaged in almost two more puck battles in the defensive zone per hour, and has a win rate two per cent better than team average. That allows for more breakouts while he\u2019s on the ice, something that would likely make a bigger impact on a team that was better in transition than the Senators.</p>\n<p>Aside from play without the puck, one thing you want from your checking centre is good puck management. It\u2019s all well and good to recover the puck from the opponent, but if you immediately turn it over it\u2019s all for naught.</p>\n<p>Looking at turnover rates you need to account for team structure and position, so we\u2019ll look at both player\u2019s turnover rates in each zone and overall relative to their teammates at the same position. Turnover rates are inverted so that positive numbers are good.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PageauPlekanec-turnovers.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3893913\" /></p>\n<p>With the puck, Pageau is quite a bit safer than Plekanec, boasting not only better turnover rates relative to team average, but superior numbers overall despite the Senators being very turnover happy.</p>\n<p>Plekanec is a bit better in the neutral zone, which is important, but that\u2019s where the fewest plays occur, and he\u2019s actually worse than team average in the defensive zone, forcing more time defending than he needs to.</p>\n<p>Pageau\u2019s offensive zone turnover rate being far better than team average is a bit misleading in a way because he\u2019s struggled to create offence this year and has been playing a little too safe. If you\u2019re always making the safe play you won\u2019t turn the puck over as much, but you also won\u2019t accomplish much.</p>\n<p>One thing to keep in mind with Pageau, since any team acquiring him would be getting him for the long haul, he appears to be having an off season, meaning his value at the moment might be lower on the trade market than the actual value of the player. If a team is in need of a long-term solution on the third line, this would be a great time to snatch him up and benefit for less than he would usually fetch.</p>\n<p>For Plekanec, he\u2019s been having a quietly strong season despite the chaos surrounding him in Montreal and the general issues that come with age. He can\u2019t seem to score goals anymore, but he\u2019s also been startlingly unlucky when shooting. Any team acquiring him can expect to see strong defensive play, and if his shooting percentage regresses, they could see a surprise influx of offence as a bonus.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to improve for just this season, Plekanec is the better bet, though long-term Pageau is going to be the better player.</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Hockey</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues>\n\t\t\t<league>NHL</league>\n\t\t</leagues>\n\t\t<teams>\n\t\t\t<team>MON</team>\n\t\t\t<team>OTT</team>\n\t\t</teams>\n\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18573140.jpg\" />\n<media:title>18573140</media:title>\n<enclosure url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18573140.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t\t<title>Olympics Today: Canada on pace to eclipse 2010, 2014 medal haul</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.sportsnet.ca/olympics/olympics-today-canada-pace-eclipse-2010-2014-medal-haul/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.sportsnet.ca/olympics/olympics-today-canada-pace-eclipse-2010-2014-medal-haul//#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 10:33:35 EST</pubDate>\n\t\t<modifiedDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 10:33:35 EST</modifiedDate >\n\t\t<dc:creator>Donnovan Bennett</dc:creator>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\"><![CDATA[https://www.sportsnet.ca/?post_type=sn-article&#038;p=3893067&#038;oc=-1]]></guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>With a quick start to these Olympic Winter Games, Canada is on pace to eclipse the 25 and 26 medal counts at the last two Olympics.

This time it came in the men&#8217;s freestyle skiing slopestyle event at Phoenix Snow Park in Pyeongchang. Canada&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/olympics/canadian-alex-beaulieu-marchand-wins-bronze-mens-ski-slopestyle/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Beaulieu-Marchand won bronze</a> with a 92.40 score. Beaulieu-Marchand had an opportunity to move up from bronze to silver or gold, but his third-run score of 82.40 kept him in third. He had a cheering squad of bare-chested Canadian moguls skiers with his initials pained on their chests as the Quebec City native improved on his previous performance when he was the only Canadian in the event in Sochi, placing 12th. </p>\n<p><strong>More medals</strong><br />\nWith a quick start to the Games, Canada is on pace to eclipse the 25 and 26 medal counts at the last two Olympics. As impressive as their medal count of 16 is to date, the Olympic Winter Games schedule sets up for more podium trips during the final week. Despite two straight losses, Kevin Koe and his rink are favoured to get a medal in men&#8217;s curling in his first Olympics. Rachel Homan and her team will be happy just to get to the medal round after starting 0-3 but have won two straight. Flag bearers Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir are the favourites to win gold in ice dancing on Monday, but will have to contend with Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron of France. Elsewhere, Kaillie Humphries and Phylicia George attempt to get Humphries her third straight title in women&#8217;s bobsleigh on Tuesday. </p>\n<p>Three Canadian sleds have already qualified for the two-man men&#8217;s final. The women&#8217;s hockey team is almost a lock for a medal as rival U.S. is the only team that can beat them in the final on Wednesday. The men&#8217;s team is the defending champion, but that was with professionals. The expectation is still medalling on Saturday, and they\u2019ve already qualified for the quarterfinals. Canadian snowboarders Mark McMorris and Max Parrot will be medal contenders again big air on Friday. </p>\n<p><strong>Another positive Russian test</strong><br />\nAmerican electoral tampering isn&#8217;t the only news of Russian cheating in the news. A Russian curler at the Olympic Games has <a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/olympics/russian-athlete-suspected-doping-pyeongchang-olympics/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">been accused of a doping violation</a>. More than 160 Russians are competing under strict conditions because Russia was penalized for widespread doping at the 2014 Games in Sochi. Male curler Alexander Krushelnytsky produced a sample with Meldonium in his urine. He has already won bronze in mixed curling. Krushelnytsky\u2019s B-sample will be tested on Monday. </p>\n<p>The veil of suspension about Russians in all sports is exactly why Russian athletes shouldn&#8217;t be competing at these Games. After it has been proven that their doping was widespread and state sponsored, any positive tests from a Russian athlete are perceived as part of a greater plot not a rogue actor. The Oscar nominated Netflix documentary Icarus and a recent <a href=\"http://www.cbs.com/shows/60_minutes/video/TB1_T3l_rHjX4Ga_rtKEDvdi3lelPioc/the-russian-doping-mastermind-on-the-run/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">60 minutes investigation</a> detailed the great lengths at all levels of government Russia went to in order to cheat. </p>\n<p>Even though the &#8220;Olympic Athletes From Russia&#8221; moniker separates them from their country and flag, that is just a technicality. The message it would have sent as a deterrent and the public faith in ensuring this is a clean competition would outweigh any potential cons. Now the Winter Olympic Games have an asterisk once again.</p>\n<h3>Prominent Canadians in action on Day 10:</h3>\n<p>Here is what&#8217;s on tap events-wise for Canadian athletes (all times Eastern):</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Curling: Feb. 18, 7:05 p.m. &#8211; Feb. 19, 12:05 a.m.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Curling Round-Robin &#8211; Japan vs Canada (7:05 p.m.)</strong><br />\nAfter an 0-3 start, the Canadian women&#8217;s curling team has started to turn things around, winning two straight. First it was a dominant win over the United States followed by a tight victory over Switzerland. After struggling early, Rachel Homan scored three points in the ninth end and stole a single in the 10th to secure a Canadian win without extras.</p>\n<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Curling Round-Robin &#8211; Canada vs United States (12:05 a.m.)</strong><br />\nAfter his second straight loss, Kevin Koe is in a battle for a playoff spot. Yesterday, a shaky start because of a Canadian rock that sailed through the house meant it was 4-0 for Switzerland after one end. Team Koe, in their four years together, have given up four in the first end only three times and are now 1-2 in those instances. With a 4-2 record, the Calgary foursome remain tied for second spot with Switzerland.</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Figure Skating: Feb. 18, 8:00 p.m.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ice Dancing &#8211; Short Dance (8:00 p.m.)</strong><br />\nCanada is the favourite so tune in if your TV surfing for medal contenders. This is likely one of the last times you&#8217;ll be able to see Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir compete. </p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Hockey: Feb. 18, 7:10 a.m.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Hockey Semifinals &#8211; Canada vs Olympic Athletes from Russia (7:10 a.m.)</strong><br />\nA loss in this contest would be seen as a massive upset. Everyone is expecting Canada to play the United States in the final. The Americans play Finland in the other semi-final Sunday night.</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Bobsleigh: Feb. 19, 6:15 a.m. </strong></p>\n<p>Two-Man &#8211; Run 3 of 4 (6:15 a.m.)</p>\n<p>Two-Man &#8211; Run 4 of 4 (8:00 a.m.)</p>\n<p>The last two runs in qualification in Bobsleigh start at 6:15 a.m. Monday morning. Canada&#8217;s largest-ever Bobsleigh team is well-represented in the two-man competition. After two runs, pilot Justin Kripps is in second just 0.10 seconds behind Nico Walther of Germany who had a time of 1:38.39. Also qualifying for the final from Canada are pilots Christopher Spring and Nick Poloniato, who tied for 10th, 0.57 seconds off the pace. Kripps and Spring adopted the sport of golf in the lead up as a training exercise to help improve concentration levels and mental toughness. Canadian Pierre Lueders is coaching the South Korean team after coaching Russia to two medals in Sochi. </p>\n<h3>Sportsnet dispatches from Korea:</h3>\n<p>\u2022 Kristina Rutherford describes how Team Homan came up with <a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/olympics/team-homan-comes-crucial-tension-filled-victory-switzerland/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">crucial, tension-filled victory over Switzerland</a>.</p>\n<p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/olympics/flag-bearers-virtue-moir-canada-olympics-career/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Interview</a> with Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir will get you in the mood to watch Olympic figure skating.

The Republic of Korea battled valiantly and frustrated Team Canada, who was the least penalized team in the tournament coming in, but lacked discipline throughout. The Korean side has seven North Americans with six Canadians and one American. The best player on the ice for either team was Korean netminder Matt Dalton from Seaforth, Ont. He faced 50 shots and was outstanding. The Canadians playing for South Korea have become a big story and, not surprisingly, have been Korea&#8217;s best players.</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/CBCOlympics/status/965201164814884865</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/CBCOlympics/status/965200280697671680 </p>\n<p>The Canadians on the Korean team play in domestic pro leagues and jumped at the chance to play in the Olympics for the host nation. Even head coach Jim Paek is Korean-born but was raised in Canada. It&#8217;s the first time South Korea has ever fielded a hockey team at the Winter Olympics. Hopefully, off of the strength of the Canadian players, they can help grow the game in the Far East and inspire a new generation of hockey players. Even though they weren&#8217;t wearing red and white, Canadians can be proud of the way the Canadian-born players represented themselves with Korea throughout the tournament.</p>\n<h3>Elsewhere on the web:</h3>\n<p>\u2022 For Olympic glory, athletes need talent and a billionaire backer.

And what a gritty come-back win it was. </p>\n<p>Up against a Swiss team that also entered this game with a 1-3 record, one loss away from what could prove to be too many to advance to the playoffs, you could feel the tension. You could see it, too, all over the face of second Joanne Courtney, whose deep exhales were a fixture as she struggled with a game-low 58 per cent efficiency.  </p>\n<p>But it mattered not, in the end. \u201cWe kind of just said, \u2018Let\u2019s go out there and fight,\u2019\u201d said third, Emma Miskew.</p>\n<p>They sure had to. The final score of 10-8 is misleading, because close at that sounds, it was a heck of a lot closer. And it was Miskew who had perhaps the finest shot in this game, in the ninth end, with a killer freeze that eventually led Homan to a wide open take-out to score three.</p>\n<p>It was enormous because of what happened before that. Team Homan gave up three points to the Swiss in two separate ends. They trailed 7-4 and then 8-6 heading into the ninth. You didn\u2019t want to see Swiss skip Silvania Tirinzoni in that situation, because she usually cruises to victory. Her record without hammer while up two points with two ends to play in the last four seasons? It was 30-1. Now it\u2019s 30-2.</p>\n<p>After that three-point end of Canada\u2019s, the reigning world champions were in the driver\u2019s seat heading into 10, needing to force a single to then force an extra end, where they\u2019d have the hammer. But Canada didn\u2019t need to. In the 10th, Homan made Tirinzoni draw the button around a couple guards, but the Swiss rock was heavy and it cruised right by, giving Canada a steal of one.</p>\n<p>The Canadians hugged one another on the ice, and then came together for the group hug. Homan\u2019s husband, Germaine, also returned to his seat at that point, wearing a huge smile. And someone from that crowd of friends and family yelled: \u201cWe believe!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a really character win,\u201d said Homan, who took a sip of her water between answering questions and apologized for the delay in her answer, because, as she said, \u201cmy throat\u2019s a little dry from yelling.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was perhaps the type of win Team Homan needed, in stark contrast to their first a day earlier, an absolute demolition of the United States that was never in doubt. Sunday\u2019s victory, Kingsbury said, \u201cwas one of those ones where it just as easily could\u2019ve gone the other way.\u201d</p>\n<p>It really looked like it was going to go Switzerland\u2019s. It\u2019s incredibly rare to win a curling game after giving up two three-enders, but the tide turned and Canada got some breaks on a couple slight-misses from the Swiss. Miskew said the thinking was never, \u201cWe need to come back,\u201d it was literally a shot-by-shot plan of, \u201cI\u2019m going to make this freeze, or I\u2019m going to make this guard,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was one shot at a time and just try to put them into the spots that we wanted so that we could capitalize on hopefully a mistake, and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d</p>\n<p>They clawed. They grinded. They fought. In other words, Mr. T would have loved this one.</p>\n<p>This is a different foursome than the one you saw earlier in this bonspiel, the one that went 0-3. Miskew says they\u2019re having fun, that they\u2019ve decided to change their mindset. \u201cWe chose to let go of the last couple days&#8230;There\u2019s nothing you can do about the way you start but you can do something about the way you finish.\u201d And after a second win here, the third added, \u201cIt\u2019s the start of us feeling more confident in shot-making out there.\u201d  </p>\n<p>Just before he ran off to catch the bus with the rest of the team, coach Kingsbury put it best: \u201cThey\u2019re rolling,\u201d he said.</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Olympics</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues/>\n\t\t<teams/>\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Leafs_Penguins2.jpg\" />\n<media:credit>Gene J.

There\u2019s foot speed \u2014 players who can chase opponents down. There\u2019s team speed \u2014 the ability to alter the point of attack through rapid puck movement and cooperative play. There\u2019s mind speed \u2014 your recognition of openings with and without the puck. How quickly can you stuff them or zip through them?</p>\n<p>\u201cWindows of opportunity open and close quickly out there,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cWhen you look at the core players we have, we\u2019ve got players that want to play fast. Number 1, they can skate. But it\u2019s more than just that. They see the ice well. They process the game quickly. They can execute quickly. All those things make a team able to play a fast game.\u201d</p>\n<p>In outrunning and outgunning the <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/toronto-maple-leafs/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"toronto-maple-leafs\" data-league=\"nhl\">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> 5-3 in Saturday\u2019s track meet, Pittsburgh played better and faster than an opponent that increasingly resembles a younger version of itself.</p>\n<p>Generational talent and defensively responsible game-breaker at 1C. Weapons on all three top lines that can punish the opposition. Scary power play. Frightening transition game. Decent but relatively thin defence core that must pull by committee. Stellar starting goalie that makes jaw-dropping saves nightly.</p>\n<div id=\"video_container-854295\" class=\"sn-video-container \">\n<div class=\"bc_shortcode_placeholder\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n        var adServerUrl = \"\";\n        var $el = $( \"#video_container-854295\" );\n        var permalink = $el.closest('.snet-single-article').data('permalink');</p>\n<p>        if ( \"1\" == true && 'undefined' !== typeof window.getIndexAds ) {\n            var so = {preroll:{1:{1:{siteID:191888},2:{siteID:191889}}}};\n            adServerUrl = window.getIndexAds( 'http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x360&iu=%2F7326%2Fen.sportsnet.web%2FVideo&ciu_szs=300x250&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&ad_rule=1&vid=5735820888001&cmsid=384', so, permalink);\n        } else {\n            adServerUrl = \"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x360&iu=%2F7326%2Fen.sportsnet.web%2FVideo&ciu_szs=300x250&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&ad_rule=1&vid=5735820888001&cmsid=384\";\n        }</p>\n<p>        $el.after( unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\\\"\" + (document.location.protocol == \"https:\" ? \"https://sb\" : \"http://b\") + \".scorecardresearch.com/beacon.js\\\" %3E%3C/script%3E\") );</p>\n<p>        $( document ).one( 'ready', function() {\n            $( \"#video_container-854295\" ).SNPlayer( {\n                bc_account_id: \"1704050871\",\n                bc_player_id: \"rkedLxwfab\",\n                //autoplay: false, \n                //is_has_autoplay_switch: false,\n                bc_videos: 5735820888001, \n                is_has_continuous_play: \"false\",\n                adserverurl: adServerUrl,\n                section: \"\",\n                thumbnail: \"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1704050871_5735827730001_5735820888001-vs-1024x576.jpg\",\n                direct_url: \"http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/hagelin-finishes-off-malkins-feed-nice-tip-goal/\"\n            });\n        });\n    </script></p>\n<p>\u201cToronto\u2019s got a young team, they can skate, they have good team speed, they move the puck well, and they\u2019re one of the teams that\u2019s trying to play a similar style that we\u2019ve been playing,\u201d Sullivan said.</p>\n<p>Sullivan holds the whistle that summons his <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/pittsburgh-penguins/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"pittsburgh-penguins\" data-league=\"nhl\">Pittsburgh Penguins</a> into go mode. He says he\u2019s been preaching the powers of speed since he was hired for this gig.</p>\n<p>Under his watch, Sidney Crosby &#038; Co. discovered a new gear halfway through 2015-16 and sped all the way to the finish. They kept that momentum burning through to the spring of 2017, hoisting consecutive Stanley Cups and quenching their thirst with champagne.</p>\n<p>And although the champs looked weary through the first two months of their three-peat bid, they\u2019ve once again floored the gas pedal.</p>\n<p>Funny, then, with speed so integral to both clubs\u2019 identity, that they wanted to pump the brakes on this one.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure we don\u2019t get lured into a track race,\u201d Sullivan said Saturday morning.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don&#8217;t want to get into too much of a track meet,\u201d Leafs centre Nazem Kadri echoed down the hall.</p>\n<p>Best intentions and all that. Cheetahs gotta run.</p>\n<p>It was blink-and-you-miss-it hockey of fine calibre, orchestrated by the two hottest teams in the game.</p>\n<p>Heading into their lively Saturday-night show, the Penguins and Leafs together had just two regulation losses in their past 20 games combined. Pittsburgh was looking for its 11th straight home victory, and Toronto was averaging 5.2 goals a night over its five-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>Mere seconds after a sprawled-out Matt Murray robbed Zach Hyman on the doorstep with a desperate glove, Carl Hagelin one-touched a Bryan Rust feed past Frederik Andersen, converting on a 3-on-2 rush and giving Pittsburgh an early lead.</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/penguins/status/965019764807618561</p>\n<p>Connor Brown solved Murray short side thanks to a smart behind-the-net setup from James van Riemsdyk and snapped a 12-game goal drought. Tyler Bozak followed by whacking in a juicy rebound coughed up from a Travis Dermott point shot.</p>\n<p>Evgeni Malkin evened the score at two after gloving an ill-advised high clear from Jake Gardiner up the middle of the defensive zone. Malkin\u2019s strike, which came off a beautiful tic-tac-toe passing sequence, marked his 900th career point.</p>\n<p>\u201cI felt good physically, but I wasn\u2019t really handling the puck well tonight,\u201d Gardiner said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what that was about.\u201d</p>\n<p>A three-point night for Malkin gives him 69 on the year, vaulting the Russian over Calgary\u2019s Johnny Gaudreau to seize second in the Art Ross race.</p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of speed,\u201d Gardiner said of the Malkin line, which bowled over Nazem Kadri\u2019s shutdown unit. \u201cIt seems like they\u2019re doing a tornado in the zone, kinda going everywhere. You can never really predict it. Guys with that much skill, it\u2019s tough to defend.\u201d</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/penguins/status/965025316682027008</p>\n<p>Crosby had an apparent goal wiped because he kicked the puck in, and Auston Matthews sent two near-identical backhand dekes high and wide. In a turn of nostalgic symmetry, ex-roommates Phil Kessel and Bozak traded Grade-A chances on A-grade goaltenders on the same shift.</p>\n<p>Yes, it was the kind of night you\u2019d want the popcorn delivered straight to your lap, lest you get up and miss a kick save or an odd-man rush.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo question we generated a lot. But three or four of our best chances, I don\u2019t think we ever got a shot on net,\u201d Mike Babcock said. \u201cThere\u2019s was lots of speed out there. If you\u2019re a fan, you had to be entertained. It was racing around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zach Aston-Reese \u2014 the most recent rookie Pittsburgh has plucked off a Google search and plunked on Crosby\u2019s wing \u2014 restored the home side\u2019s lead in Period 2 when he kicked a rebound to his backhand and flipped it over Andersen.</p>\n<p>Patrick Marleau tied the game for a third time on another tic-tac-toe play, this one started by Matthews and Brown on a power play. Marleau\u2019s 20th of the year gives the 38-year-old 15 20-goal campaigns in his Hall of Fame\u2013worthy career, but he was hardly celebrating.</p>\n<div id=\"video_container-717758\" class=\"sn-video-container \">\n<div class=\"bc_shortcode_placeholder\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n        var adServerUrl = \"\";\n        var $el = $( \"#video_container-717758\" );\n        var permalink = $el.closest('.snet-single-article').data('permalink');</p>\n<p>        if ( \"1\" == true && 'undefined' !== typeof window.getIndexAds ) {\n            var so = {preroll:{1:{1:{siteID:191888},2:{siteID:191889}}}};\n            adServerUrl = window.getIndexAds( 'http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x360&iu=%2F7326%2Fen.sportsnet.web%2FVideo&ciu_szs=300x250&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&ad_rule=1&vid=5735855174001&cmsid=384', so, permalink);\n        } else {\n            adServerUrl = \"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x360&iu=%2F7326%2Fen.sportsnet.web%2FVideo&ciu_szs=300x250&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&ad_rule=1&vid=5735855174001&cmsid=384\";\n        }</p>\n<p>        $el.after( unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\\\"\" + (document.location.protocol == \"https:\" ? \"https://sb\" : \"http://b\") + \".scorecardresearch.com/beacon.js\\\" %3E%3C/script%3E\") );</p>\n<p>        $( document ).one( 'ready', function() {\n            $( \"#video_container-717758\" ).SNPlayer( {\n                bc_account_id: \"1704050871\",\n                bc_player_id: \"rkedLxwfab\",\n                //autoplay: false, \n                //is_has_autoplay_switch: false,\n                bc_videos: 5735855174001, \n                is_has_continuous_play: \"false\",\n                adserverurl: adServerUrl,\n                section: \"\",\n                thumbnail: \"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1704050871_5735859996001_5735855174001-vs-1024x576.jpg\",\n                direct_url: \"http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/marleau-scores-make-15-career-20-goal-seasons/\"\n            });\n        });\n    </script></p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s better when those goals come in wins,\u201d Marleau said.</p>\n<p>Zach Hyman\u2019s speed produced a gasp-inducing moment in the third period, when Olli Maatta\u2019s stick clipped his skate and Hyman\u2019s head crashed into the end-boards as he outraced an icing.

With the Golden Knights taking a poorly timed line change, Scherbak crashed in on his off-wing and pulled the puck around Fleury before tucking it in on the short side. He had virtually no angle left to make the play and still pulled it off.</p>\n<p>In the third period, 22-year-old Canadiens forward Jonathan Drouin made his way into the slot and scored his team\u2019s third goal of the game with a wicked slapshot on the power play.</p>\n<p>Hudon, Scherbak, Galchenyuk and Drouin were Montreal\u2019s most dangerous forwards in the game. Canadiens fans are going to want to see them be as dynamic in every game from here to the end of the season. If they can be, that bodes well for this team\u2019s future.</p>\n<div id=\"video_container-390737\" class=\"sn-video-container \">\n<div class=\"bc_shortcode_placeholder\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n        var adServerUrl = \"\";\n        var $el = $( \"#video_container-390737\" );\n        var permalink = $el.closest('.snet-single-article').data('permalink');</p>\n<p>        if ( \"1\" == true && 'undefined' !== typeof window.getIndexAds ) {\n            var so = {preroll:{1:{1:{siteID:191888},2:{siteID:191889}}}};\n            adServerUrl = window.getIndexAds( 'http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x360&iu=%2F7326%2Fen.sportsnet.web%2FVideo&ciu_szs=300x250&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&ad_rule=1&vid=5735833144001&cmsid=384', so, permalink);\n        } else {\n            adServerUrl = \"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x360&iu=%2F7326%2Fen.sportsnet.web%2FVideo&ciu_szs=300x250&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&ad_rule=1&vid=5735833144001&cmsid=384\";\n        }</p>\n<p>        $el.after( unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\\\"\" + (document.location.protocol == \"https:\" ? \"https://sb\" : \"http://b\") + \".scorecardresearch.com/beacon.js\\\" %3E%3C/script%3E\") );</p>\n<p>        $( document ).one( 'ready', function() {\n            $( \"#video_container-390737\" ).SNPlayer( {\n                bc_account_id: \"1704050871\",\n                bc_player_id: \"rkedLxwfab\",\n                //autoplay: false, \n                //is_has_autoplay_switch: false,\n                bc_videos: 5735833144001, \n                is_has_continuous_play: \"false\",\n                adserverurl: adServerUrl,\n                section: \"\",\n                thumbnail: \"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1704050871_5735827770001_5735833144001-vs-1024x576.jpg\",\n                direct_url: \"http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/scherbak-pulls-ridiculous-drag-move-around-fleury-score/\"\n            });\n        });\n    </script></p>\n<p><strong>A peculiar decision</strong></p>\n<p>Antti Niemi gave Carey Price some rest when he took to Montreal\u2019s net in Colorado this past Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Canadiens coach Claude Julien had considered Niemi\u2019s career numbers against Colorado and decided he was a better fit to face the Avalanche\u2014especially since the team was going to play in Arizona a night later and Price had never lost to the Coyotes in nine starts against them.</p>\n<p>It was a justifiable decision, even though the Canadiens failed to pick up points in either city.</p>\n<p>But, no matter how you sliced it, you couldn\u2019t suggest that Julien\u2019s decision to start Niemi over Price in Vegas would reflect well on him, Price or the Canadiens in any way.</p>\n<p>When the coach was asked before the game why he was making that call, he said, \u201cBecause I have two goalies, guys, and Niemi\u2019s the guy that\u2019s gonna go in nets for us tonight, and I plan on utilizing both and Niemi\u2019s been playing well.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Julien was asked in French if he was benching Price after he allowed five goals on 23 shots in Arizona, his response was only slightly more revealing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s more about where we are right now,\u201d said Julien. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to overuse the players. And in Price\u2019s case it\u2019s not a punishment, either. We\u2019ll see him in the next game [Tuesday in Philadelphia]. Listen, we haven\u2019t had an easy season, all of us. For sure it\u2019s frustrating. There\u2019s players who know because they know they\u2019re capable of playing a lot better than they have. There\u2019s years where things like that happen, so you just have to stay positive and keep your focus and continue to try to play well and win some games and finish strong. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to try to do from here to the end of the season and we\u2019ll manage the situation that way.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a response that can be interpreted many different ways.</p>\n<p>Perhaps Julien didn\u2019t want to feed Price to the proverbial wolves\u2014a Vegas team with the best home record in the NHL welcoming his road-worst Canadiens.</p>\n<p>If that was the reason, it doesn\u2019t look particularly great on Price, who was signed this past July to an eight-year, $84-million contract that kicks in next fall. The thought is he\u2019s going to be making that much money because he has proven he gives the team a chance to win even when it looks hopeless.</p>\n<p>We can\u2019t say for sure that Price would\u2019ve stopped the three of Vegas\u2019s first six shots that beat Niemi in this game, but not giving him that chance would only incite speculation that Julien didn\u2019t feel confident enough in him to face that challenge.</p>\n<p>And if this was an Niemi showcase for a trade (we sincerely doubt it was), it went south less than 10 minutes in\u2014with Price relieving him of his duties for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<div id=\"video_container-297310\" class=\"sn-video-container \">\n<div class=\"bc_shortcode_placeholder\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n        var adServerUrl = \"\";\n        var $el = $( \"#video_container-297310\" );\n        var permalink = $el.closest('.snet-single-article').data('permalink');</p>\n<p>        if ( \"1\" == true && 'undefined' !== typeof window.getIndexAds ) {\n            var so = {preroll:{1:{1:{siteID:191888},2:{siteID:191889}}}};\n            adServerUrl = window.getIndexAds( 'http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x360&iu=%2F7326%2Fen.sportsnet.web%2FVideo&ciu_szs=300x250&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&ad_rule=1&vid=5735834250001&cmsid=384', so, permalink);\n        } else {\n            adServerUrl = \"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x360&iu=%2F7326%2Fen.sportsnet.web%2FVideo&ciu_szs=300x250&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&ad_rule=1&vid=5735834250001&cmsid=384\";\n        }</p>\n<p>        $el.after( unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\\\"\" + (document.location.protocol == \"https:\" ? \"https://sb\" : \"http://b\") + \".scorecardresearch.com/beacon.js\\\" %3E%3C/script%3E\") );</p>\n<p>        $( document ).one( 'ready', function() {\n            $( \"#video_container-297310\" ).SNPlayer( {\n                bc_account_id: \"1704050871\",\n                bc_player_id: \"rkedLxwfab\",\n                //autoplay: false, \n                //is_has_autoplay_switch: false,\n                bc_videos: 5735834250001, \n                is_has_continuous_play: \"false\",\n                adserverurl: adServerUrl,\n                section: \"\",\n                thumbnail: \"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1704050871_5735832227001_5735834250001-vs-1024x576.jpg\",\n                direct_url: \"http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/antti-niemi-gets-pulled-giving-3-goals-6-shots/\"\n            });\n        });\n    </script></p>\n<p><strong>The numbers are ugly</strong></p>\n<p>This was the Canadiens\u2019 fifth consecutive loss.</p>\n<p>That makes three streaks of five losses or more for them this season, which hasn\u2019t happened since 2000-01.</p>\n<p>It was also Montreal\u2019s 11th loss in their last 12 road games.</p>\n<p>And it was the 14th time this season the Canadiens have allowed as many as five goals in a game.</p>\n<p>We suppose it doesn\u2019t matter all that much whether the Canadiens allow just one goal or five so long as the result is a loss\u2014especially now that we\u2019ve reached this point of the season.

The 2018 NBA Skills Competition will be remembered for the high amount of missed shots and dunk attempts rather than the frequency of wow moments. </p>\n<p>Here are my takeaways from the show that the NBA players put on in Hollywood for the biggest night during NBA All-Star weekend. </p>\n<p><strong>Raptors Hate</strong><br />\nBefore the competition started Jimmy Butler tried to throw shade on the Raptors during the Team Stephen Curry practice.

Spencer Dinwiddie won, but let\u2019s be honest: nobody cares &#8212; including the players performing in the competition. </p>\n<p>The name of the event itself is flawed as they don&#8217;t display skills and the course is not a challenge. Everyone is traveling at half speed. There is no chance any of the competitors even bothered to stretch before they took the floor. This needs to be abolished in favour of Charles Barkley racing a referee. I&#8217;d rather watch NBA players play a game of bump than the skills challenge. Literally, anything else would be more entertaining than this. Even two ball. Next year, fill the allotted Skills challenge time slot with Stephen Curry and LeBron James picking their respective All-Star teams live.

The movie everyone is talking about right now is Black Panther, which is on track to set box office records. </p>\n<p>Oladipo decided to elicit some Marvel super power help for his second dunk. Oladipo casually walked over to Black Panther leading man Chadwick Boseman, who was seated with co-star Michael B. Jordan, and grabbed a mask from the film to wear during his attempt.

Well enough that not one, but two contending teams acquired him late last July. Well enough to generate 2.1 wins above replacement, according to FanGraphs.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"/baseball/mlb/teams/toronto-blue-jays/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"toronto-blue-jays\" data-league=\"mlb\">Toronto Blue Jays</a> would likely welcome a repeat of the 4.41 ERA and 157 innings he provided in 2018. That\u2019s the kind of production they missed in 2017, when the likes of Nick Tepesch, Cesar Valdez and Casey Lawrence were called on to fill in all too often.</p>\n<p>To Garcia, though, that\u2019s not the expectation. He\u2019s expecting his 10th season in the big leagues to be his best yet, even if he\u2019ll be pitching in one of baseball\u2019s toughest divisions.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m ready for that challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in my stuff. I believe that the best of my career is yet to come even though I\u2019ve been through a lot, and I\u2019m welcoming that challenge.\u201d</p>\n<p>Garcia&#8217;s best seasons to date came early in his career in St. Louis. He placed third in Rookie of the Year balloting in 2010 after posting a 2.70 ERA in 28 starts. The following season he logged 194.2 innings while posting a 3.56 ERA. But he has since battled injuries that required shoulder surgery in 2013 and thoracic outlet surgery in 2014.</p>\n<p>After signing a one-year deal worth $10 million with the Blue Jays Thursday, Garcia joined his new teammates in Dunedin, Fla. Friday morning. A groundball pitcher, he generates more than his share of weak contact with an effective two-seamer. At 31 years old, he still averages 90.7 m.p.h. with the fastball.</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe in myself, I believe in my stuff,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThe way these guys received me encouraged me even more. I just know we\u2019re going to be good this year.\u201d</p>\n<p>The addition of Garcia rounds out a Blue Jays starting five of <a href=\"/baseball/mlb/players/marcus-stroman/501969\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"501969\">Marcus Stroman</a>, <a href=\"/baseball/mlb/players/aaron-sanchez/548178\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"548178\">Aaron Sanchez</a>, <a href=\"/baseball/mlb/players/j-a-happ/253985\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"253985\">J.A. Happ</a> and <a href=\"/baseball/mlb/players/marco-estrada/291479\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"291479\">Marco Estrada</a>. If healthy, that group could provide manager John Gibbons with an above-average rotation.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re bringing in a good veteran who knows how to pitch,\u201d Gibbons said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to have him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course, the Blue Jays were similarly optimistic a year ago this time when Francisco Liriano seemed poised to make an impact as the fifth starter. Instead, too many pitchers got injured and too few options were available to replace them. Toronto starters combined for a 4.57 ERA.</p>\n<p>A year later, the addition of Garcia pushes <a href=\"/baseball/mlb/players/joe-biagini/599307\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"599307\">Joe Biagini</a> out of the rotation \u2013 at least on paper. The Blue Jays will keep stretching Biagini out to keep their options open, but GM Ross Atkins said Thursday that he\u2019d be comfortable optioning the right-hander to triple-A as a way to preserve depth. Gibbons would prefer to keep Biagini in the big-league bullpen if he\u2019s not starting, and that possibility intrigues the 27-year-old.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll always prefer starting, but I\u2019ll also say that pitching for this team and trying to help this team win in any capacity would probably trump the starting thing,\u201d Biagini said.</p>\n<p>Even so, the Blue Jays would likely send him to the minors if all of their starters emerge from spring training healthy. If that\u2019s the case, Biagini will accept the challenge, and the Blue Jays will likely need him before long.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo be a Rule 5 acquisition, the impact that he had in 2016 as a reliever, how well he handled bouncing back and forth from start to relief to start was exceptional,\u201d Atkins said. \u201cHe\u2019s selfless as a teammate. He remains that way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Those big-picture decisions are in the distance just three days into spring training. There\u2019s plenty of time to determine where Biagini will pitch.</p>\n<p>For now, he\u2019s no longer among Toronto\u2019s top five starters. That in itself shows that the Blue Jays\u2019 rotation has improved.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s one of the best in baseball,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely talented.\u201d</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Baseball</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues>\n\t\t\t<league>MLB</league>\n\t\t</leagues>\n\t\t<teams>\n\t\t\t<team>TOR</team>\n\t\t</teams>\n\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/girard_samuel.jpg\" />\n<media:credit>HO-COC, Vincent Ethier/CP</media:credit>\n<media:title>girard_samuel</media:title>\n<media:text>Canada's Samuel Girard</media:text>\n<enclosure url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/girard_samuel.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t\t<title>How harnessing short-track chaos propelled Samuel Girard to Olympic gold</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.sportsnet.ca/olympics/harnessing-short-track-chaos-propelled-samuel-girard-olympic-gold/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.sportsnet.ca/olympics/harnessing-short-track-chaos-propelled-samuel-girard-olympic-gold//#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 12:16:49 EST</pubDate>\n\t\t<modifiedDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 17:10:10 EST</modifiedDate >\n\t\t<dc:creator>Shi Davidi</dc:creator>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\"><![CDATA[https://www.sportsnet.ca/?post_type=sn-article&#038;p=3892699&#038;oc=-1]]></guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The madness of short-track speedskating meant that Samuel Girard nearly missed the men\u2019s 1,000-metre final entirely.

Initial results in the sport have, of course, the staying power of ice in a desert, and so as the two stood off to the side talking things over and watching the screen, they both knew it was far from over.</p>\n<p>The veteran Hamelin ended up being penalized for impeding, propelling Olympic rookie Girard into the final, which he won with a strong wire-to-wire to skate that made his first Games medal a golden one. The 21-year-old from Ferland-et-Boilleau, Que., comfortably beat American John-Henry Krueger, the duo out in front of a huge crash in the penultimate lap that wiped out the rest of the field.</p>\n<p>Seo Yira, the South Korean skater with whom Hamelin initially bumped with in the semifinals, ended up claiming the bronze, underlining the narrow margin between disappointment and the podium.</p>\n<p>&#34;This is short-track,&#34; Girard said, both embracing and surrendering to the chaos, &#34;things happen.&#34;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"> Sam Girard wins gold in men&#39;s 1000m short track<a href=\"https://t.co/7Kkz3zjwmE\">https://t.co/7Kkz3zjwmE</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Ge8YEjUgBC\">pic.twitter.com/Ge8YEjUgBC</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; CBC Olympics (@CBCOlympics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CBCOlympics/status/964839918554853381?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 17, 2018</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>They certainly did for Girard, who ended up fourth in the men\u2019s 1,500 earlier this week and whose goal was to share a podium with Hamelin. The 33-year-old was thinking the same thing, and thought both he and Girard would be in position to advance until some contact with Seo left the Canadians staring up at the board, waiting for the referees to determine their fates.</p>\n<p>&#34;Sam and the Korean tried to pass on me, we hit each other\u2019s skates, got unbalanced in that straightaway that led me to go really wide in that corner,&#34; said Hamelin. &#34;I tried to protect my spot because I knew it was an easy moment for getting passed on the inside. I think it wasn\u2019t the thing to do at that moment. That\u2019s what the referees saw on the replay. I need to see the race back because I don\u2019t really understand what happened and what I could have done more. It is what it is.&#34;</p>\n<p>Going from disappointment to opportunity in an instant, Girard needed a mental reset and coach Derrick Campbell and team psychologist Fabien Abejean helped provide one.</p>\n<p>Campbell said Girard had made some mistakes racing in his first Olympic final during the 1,500, when he went out too hard and didn\u2019t have the energy to chase down the leaders after a crash opened things up.</p>\n<p>This time around, the chat with Campbell and Abejean &#34;helped me be in the right zone,&#34; according to Girard, who decided then and there that he had to jump out to a lead in the final and try to hold it while expected chaos played out in the back.</p>\n<p>&#34;To be in the front of the race is really my place,&#34; said Girard. &#34;Canadians are strong, we\u2019re able to control the race, and I really wanted to be out front and be away from the crashes behind me. I knew something would happen, it\u2019s the final, everyone wants to be on the podium, so that\u2019s why I went to the front and give a little more energy to stay in the front.&#34;</p>\n<p>Krueger had a similar approach, quipping that &#34;great minds think alike.&#34; The American managed to race one lap in the lead but was otherwise behind Girard the whole time.</p>\n<p>&#34;He did it a little bit better than I did,&#34; said Krueger. &#34;We both knew there were some talented and strong skaters in the back and even though it\u2019s physically harder to lead upfront, there\u2019s just too much traffic and too much stuff that can go down to stay in the back. We both stayed up front and it paid off for both of us.&#34;</p>\n<p>Girard\u2019s victory comes at a point of transition for the short-track program, with Hamelin and his fianc\u00e9e Marianne St-Gelais both saying Pyeongchang are their last Olympics. Kim Boutin of Sherbooke, Que., is picking up the mantle from St-Gelais on the women\u2019s side with a pair of bronze medals so far while Girard now has gold on the men\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>The first couple of short-track, with seven Olympic medals between them, have so far been shutout.</p>\n<p>&#34;We thought he had a chance in all three distances to come here and have a shot at the podium,&#34; Campbell said of Girard. &#34;The men\u2019s field is so deep right now, you look at the quarterfinals, they\u2019re super tough, semifinals, I mean, he almost went out in the semifinals.</p>\n<p>&#34;It goes to show you any given day there are a number of guys who can win.&#34;</p>\n<p>This time, it was Girard, who is rooming with Hamelin in Pyeongchang with the two of them spending the entire day together ahead of their races in preparation. &#34;We were ready to do a great race in the semis,&#34; said Hamelin. &#34;It didn\u2019t go as planned but Sam is doing a great job and he\u2019s really happy with his results right now.&#34;</p>\n<p>Girard had plenty of reason to be.</p>\n<p>&#34;I\u2019m really happy he was on the edge of the ice to share that with me,&#34; he said of Hamelin. &#34;Also my girlfriend was there so I could share my emotion with the people I love. I was really happy about that. </p>\n<p>&#34;Having a medal at maybe his last Olympics and my first one, a gold medal at my first Olympics, that\u2019s the best thing you can expect. I\u2019m really, really happy right now.&#34;</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Olympics</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues/>\n\t\t<teams/>\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"must-see\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1704050871_5735890149001_5735888914001-vs.jpg\" />\n<media:title>1704050871_5735890149001_5735888914001-vs</media:title>\n<enclosure url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1704050871_5735890149001_5735888914001-vs.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t\t<title>NHL issues statement condemning fans who racially taunted Smith-Pelly</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/nhl-issues-statement-condemning-fans-racially-taunted-smith-pelly/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/nhl-issues-statement-condemning-fans-racially-taunted-smith-pelly//#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 11:43:17 EST</pubDate>\n\t\t<modifiedDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 11:43:17 EST</modifiedDate >\n\t\t<dc:creator>Steven Loung</dc:creator>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\"><![CDATA[https://www.sportsnet.ca/?post_type=sn-article&#038;p=3893927&#038;oc=-1]]></guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The NHL has issued a statement condemning the actions of the four fans who racially taunted Devante Smith-Pelly during Saturday&#8217;s 7-1 Chicago Blackhawks win over the Washington Capitals.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>The NHL has <a href=\"https://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-makes-statement-regarding-chicago-incident/c-296098826?tid=280504338\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">issued a statement</a> condemning the actions of the four fans who racially taunted <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/players/devante-smith-pelly/554489\" class=\"sn-player-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-player=\"554489\">Devante Smith-Pelly</a> during Saturday&#8217;s 7-1 <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/chicago-blackhawks/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"chicago-blackhawks\" data-league=\"nhl\">Chicago Blackhawks</a> win over the <a href=\"/hockey/nhl/teams/washington-capitals/\" class=\"sn-team-post-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-team=\"washington-capitals\" data-league=\"nhl\">Washington Capitals</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Last night in Chicago, individuals directed racial taunts and abuse at Washington Capitals player Devante Smith-Pelly,&#8221; NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman wrote. &#8220;The National Hockey League condemns this unacceptable and reprehensible behavior.

On the back nine, he made three birdies, including a key one on the 16th, where he made a 30-foot putt.</p>\n<p>    &#34;It feels great. I didn&#8217;t know what to expect when I came here but to play a course like this which is in great condition &#8212; it&#8217;s a great technical golf course as well &#8212; it was beyond my expectation and to hold the trophy is even better,&#34; said Luiten, who is expected to rise to No. 65 in the new rankings on Monday.</p>\n<p>    &#34;I had a great start, that&#8217;s what I was hoping for. I hit some nice ones in close and rolled in a couple of nice putts and that gets you in the right position, where you want to be.</p>\n<p>    &#34;Unfortunately, I had a couple of bogeys as well on the front nine, but I recovered from that with a couple of nice birdies on the back nine and it was a good battle with Woody.&#34;</p>\n<p>    Playing one group ahead, England&#8217;s Wood was right in the mix and tied with Luiten at 15-under when their fortunes went in opposite directions almost at the same time. On the 17th hole, Wood drove his tee shot into the hazard left and could do no more than chip his ball out for a bogey. Luiten, meanwhile, drained his 30-footer birdie putt on the 16th for a two-shot swing.</p>\n<p>    Recovering his form after a series of disappointments, Wood was let down by the loss and said: &#34;It&#8217;s golf isn&#8217;t it?

He should be OK in a couple of days,&#34; said Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri.</p>\n<p>    Higuain was left grimacing on the pitch three minutes in after making contact near the endline with Torino goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu, who broke up a Juventus chance.</p>\n<p>    After staying on for another 10 minutes, Higuain exited and was replaced by Federico Bernardeschi.</p>\n<p>    Less than 20 minutes later, Bernardeschi set up Alex Sandro&#8217;s goal, dribbling past a defender then providing the cross for Sandro to tap in from close range.</p>\n<p>    Higuain scored twice when Juventus drew 2-2 with Tottenham on Tuesday. The return leg is scheduled for London on March 7.</p>\n<p>    Meanwhile, Juventus was encouraged that Paulo Dybala came on for the final 25 minutes for his first action after several weeks out injured.</p>\n<p>    &#34;Paulo played 30 minutes at a good level,&#34; Allegri said. &#34;I&#8217;m pleased with his and everyone else&#8217;s performance. This is a good result against a well-organized Torino side.&#34;</p>\n<p>    It was Juventus&#8217; ninth straight win but the Bianconeri remained one point behind Italian leader Napoli, which beat relegation-threatened Spal 1-0</p>\n<p>  &#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p>    IMMEDIATE INTENTIONS</p>\n<p>    Three days after losing 3-1 to Leipzig in the Europa League, Napoli had a strong start against Spal.</p>\n<p>    The hosts showed their intentions immediately when Lorenzo Insigne hit the post four minutes in.</p>\n<p>    Two minutes later, Allan scored following a series of short, mesmerizing passes that have characterized Napoli&#8217;s play all season.</p>\n<p>    Napoli captain Marek Hamsik thought he had doubled the advantage shortly after the hour mark but his header was waved off for offside after the VAR was consulted.</p>\n<p>    Napoli has also won nine straight, a club record for a single season.</p>\n<p>    &#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p>    OTHER MATCHES</p>\n<p>    Last-placed Benevento earned its third win of the season with a 3-2 win over fellow southern club Crotone.</p>\n<p>    Cheick Diabate scored the winner two minutes from the end.</p>\n<p>    Also, Bologna beat 10-man Sassuolo 2-1 with a late free kick from Erick Pulgar in a matchup of regional rivals.</p>\n<p>    Later, AC Milan was hosting Sampdoria.</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Soccer</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues>\n\t\t\t<league>Serie A</league>\n\t\t</leagues>\n\n\t\t<teams/>\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-18-at-1.47.01-AM.png\" />\n<media:title>Screen Shot 2018-02-18 at 1.47.01 AM</media:title>\n<enclosure url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-18-at-1.47.01-AM.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\" />\t\t<title>LFR11 &#8211; Game 60 &#8211; Pensmanship</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/lfr11-game-60-pensmanship/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/lfr11-game-60-pensmanship//#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 07:57:01 EST</pubDate>\n\t\t<modifiedDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 07:57:01 EST</modifiedDate >\n\t\t<dc:creator>Steve Dangle</dc:creator>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\"><![CDATA[https://www.sportsnet.ca/?post_type=sn-article&#038;p=3893773&#038;oc=-1]]></guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The Leafs get grinded out in a valuable lesson.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>The Leafs get grinded out in a valuable lesson.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s9Af2-Lz8AU\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Hockey</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues>\n\t\t\t<league>NHL</league>\n\t\t</leagues>\n\n\t\t<teams/>\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18552542.jpg\" />\n<media:credit>Mark Humphrey/AP</media:credit>\n<media:title>18552542</media:title>\n<enclosure url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/18552542.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t\t<title>20 Fantasy Thoughts: Hamilton among top D after hat trick</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/20-fantasy-thoughts-hamilton-among-top-d-hat-trick/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/20-fantasy-thoughts-hamilton-among-top-d-hat-trick//#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 07:46:43 EST</pubDate>\n\t\t<modifiedDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 07:51:28 EST</modifiedDate >\n\t\t<dc:creator>Ian Gooding</dc:creator>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\"><![CDATA[https://www.sportsnet.ca/?post_type=sn-article&#038;p=3893783&#038;oc=-1]]></guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Every Sunday during the regular season, we&#8217;ll share 20 Fantasy Thoughts from our writers at DobberHockey.

These thoughts are curated from the past week&#8217;s &#8220;Daily Ramblings&#8221;.</em></p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>1. If the rumors are true about Derick Brassard being a serious trade target for the Blues, he has sure aided his own trade value over the past week. With a goal and two assists on Saturday, Brassard now has goals in four consecutive games and five of his last six games. This recent run of success was preceded by an eight-game pointless drought, so any real and fantasy teams interested in Brassard could experience both peaks and valleys. </p>\n<p>2. Hat tricks among defencemen are rare. So, Dougie Hamilton owners will gladly take his three goals on Saturday. With 13 goals, Hamilton is only behind P.K. Subban for goals by a blueliner. Hamilton\u2019s success in scoring goals (double-digit goal totals in each of the last four seasons) comes from his ability to take shots. Hamilton\u2019s 180 shots on goal places him in the top 5 in that category. Hamilton also has 12 points over his last 11 games.</p>\n<p>Something that is helping Hamilton\u2019s cause at the moment: he has logged at least seven minutes of power-play time in three of his last five games. The Flames haven\u2019t always used Hamilton on the first-unit power play, but they are now. Both player and team are benefitting.</p>\n<p>3. Anze Kopitar has been an example of consistency throughout his career, as he has reached 25 goals for the eighth time in his career after scoring two goals on Saturday. After barely finishing in the top 100 with 0.68 P/GP last season, he is having a nice bounce-back campaign, as he is back within the top 20 with 1.09 P/GP. He has also been very consistent recently, scoring 17 points over his last 15 games. A coaching change from Darryl Sutter\u2019s stifling defensive strategy to John Stevens, and Pierre Turgeon\u2019s more up-tempo strategy, has had a major positive fantasy impact on Kopitar.  </p>\n<p>Some other factors are at play for Kopitar. He is also shooting the puck again, as he is on pace for nearly 200 shots, a number that he has not reached since the 2013-14 season. As well, his ice time is up more than a minute per game, which might have something to do with fellow centre Jeff Carter\u2019s injury. Only Aleksander Barkov has a higher ice time per game than Kopitar (21:56). So, Carter\u2019s return could be a concern, as it could slightly cut into Kopitar\u2019s fantasy value.</p>\n<p>4. Lost in the resurgence of the Avalanche this year among the many stories of the team \u2013 Nathan MacKinnon\u2019s Hart-worthy campaign pre-injury, Alex Kerfoot\u2019s rookie year, and Mikko Rantanen\u2019s continued growth as a producer \u2013 is the resurgence of Gabriel Landeskog.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to forget that from 2011-2016, he was one of three players in the league to manage 20 goals, 30 assists, 50 penalty minutes, and average two shots on goal per game in each 82-game season. The other two were Jamie Benn and Evgeni Malkin. That\u2019s really good roto consistency, and if you play in leagues with hits he was even more of a stud.</p>\n<p>Like most Avs, everything fell apart in 2016-17 when he posted a career-low 18 goals and a career-low 15 assists (again, counting only 82-game campaigns). Well, he\u2019s on pace to crack more than 20 goals and 30 assists, and average two shots on goal per game again. He probably won\u2019t crack 50 PIM, unless he can take a 10-minute misconduct here at some point, but he\u2019s still on pace for somewhere around 35 with roughly 130 hits to boot. He\u2019s back to being who he was and that\u2019s a consistent stat-stuffer.</p>\n<p>5. At the risk of gushing too much over Mathew Barzal, please allow a bit more gushing. With 62 points in 60 games, he\u2019s on pace to become the 28th player in NHL history to be a point-per-game as a rookie. More impressive: He would be just the fourth in the last 25 years (Evgeni Malkin, Alex Ovechkin, Sidney Crosby), and the first in a decade. I used 70 games as the cut-off so please don\u2019t scream at me, Oilers fans.</p>\n<p>There are few players I would trade away Barzal one-for-one in dynasty leagues \u2013 this is definitely not a \u2018sell-high\u2019 situation. Enjoy the ride, everyone. If John Tavares sticks around as a free agent, the Islanders will be one of the most entertaining shows on ice for years to come.    </p>\n<div id=\"video_container-644516\" class=\"sn-video-container \">\n<div class=\"bc_shortcode_placeholder\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n        var adServerUrl = \"\";\n        var $el = $( \"#video_container-644516\" );\n        var permalink = $el.closest('.snet-single-article').data('permalink');</p>\n<p>        if ( \"1\" == true && 'undefined' !== typeof window.getIndexAds ) {\n            var so = {preroll:{1:{1:{siteID:191888},2:{siteID:191889}}}};\n            adServerUrl = window.getIndexAds( 'http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x360&iu=%2F7326%2Fen.sportsnet.web%2FVideo&ciu_szs=300x250&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&ad_rule=1&vid=5725607641001&cmsid=384', so, permalink);\n        } else {\n            adServerUrl = \"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x360&iu=%2F7326%2Fen.sportsnet.web%2FVideo&ciu_szs=300x250&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&ad_rule=1&vid=5725607641001&cmsid=384\";\n        }</p>\n<p>        $el.after( unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\\\"\" + (document.location.protocol == \"https:\" ? \"https://sb\" : \"http://b\") + \".scorecardresearch.com/beacon.js\\\" %3E%3C/script%3E\") );</p>\n<p>        $( document ).one( 'ready', function() {\n            $( \"#video_container-644516\" ).SNPlayer( {\n                bc_account_id: \"1704050871\",\n                bc_player_id: \"rkedLxwfab\",\n                //autoplay: false, \n                //is_has_autoplay_switch: false,\n                bc_videos: 5725607641001, \n                is_has_continuous_play: \"false\",\n                adserverurl: adServerUrl,\n                section: \"\",\n                thumbnail: \"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1704050871_5725655939001_5725607641001-vs.jpg\",\n                direct_url: \"http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/islanders-eberle-scores-off-kick-pass-barzal/\"\n            });\n        });\n    </script></p>\n<p>6. Justin Schultz looks to be in line for a huge fantasy value boost. While he had been syphoning top power-play minutes away from Kris Letang for a while now, it seems like this may be a more permanent state of affairs. Reportedly, coach Mike Sullivan wants Letang on the second unit because he\u2019ll feel less obligated to distribute and focus more on getting the puck to the net.  Given the talent on the top PP unit, that makes sense.</p>\n<p>If Schultz is indeed locked into the prime power-play minutes, he should be able to greatly improve his PP production and thus his overall production. Again, great news for Schultz owners, bad news for Letang owners.</p>\n<p>7. Ducks\u2019 Ondrej Kase quietly has 16 points in 17 games since the start of January and is doing it without the benefit of top unit PP time. I don\u2019t love the massive shooting percentage spike from last season\u2019s 6.5 percent to this season\u2019s 16.5 percent, but as a sophomore we don\u2019t yet know his true shooting value. It\u2019s likely somewhere around 10-12 percent, as is the case with most skilled forwards. Is this a legit breakout, or fool\u2019s gold? There\u2019s a strong argument that he is the one driving the line with Nick Ritchie and Adam Henrique. Kase hasn\u2019t had elite linemates for most of the season, spending only 11 percent of his shifts with Ryan Getzlaf.</p>\n<p>8. Coyotes\u2019 Clayton Keller has perked up with eight points in the last six games. He has really slowed after a hot first month but that first month showed us how talented he is. Perhaps he can put together another crazy run.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth remembering that strange things can happen with talented players over smaller samples. After the trade deadline last season, Gustav Nyquist and Tomas Tatar were top-30 scorers. Would you be shocked if Keller finished up the season with a crazy run of 20-plus games with point-per-game play? The Coyotes have been more competitive in the second half, albeit without much offence. Don\u2019t overreact to this hot streak but acknowledge that something productive could be happening here.</p>\n<p>9. Someone is going to stop Eeli Tolvanen eventually, right? The 18-year old first-round pick for Nashville has been a force for Jokerit this year even if his scoring slowed down after a scorching start. His first game at the Winter Olympics saw a four-point effort (one goals and three assists) against Germany., and he followed that up with two goals against Norway. </p>\n<p>There\u2019s a reasonable argument to be made that instead of pushing more future assets into a rental at the deadline that the Predators should just try to bring Tolvanen over once his KHL season is done.</p>\n<p>Maybe, but I think that this runs counter to how the Predators like to bring along their prospects. The learning curve for Tolvanen wouldn\u2019t be as heavy coming over from the pros in Russia, as well as having played in North America last season, but I do still suspect there would be some teaching required. I\u2019d suggest that you don\u2019t count on him offering anything this season and maybe not even next if the Predators really take their time. Eventually though, this is another shot-generation monster they have coming.</p>\n<p>10. Vladislav Namestnikov\u2019s name has emerged on the trade market. I\u2019d put the likelihood on him getting dealt on the low end of the spectrum but what a whirlwind for a guy who was one of the hottest options through the first three months. Since then, he has bounced around the lineup, seen his minutes drop, and has just 10 points in the last 21 games. Even if not traded, we have serious cause for concern here.</p>\n<p>11. With Brian Elliott on the shelf for 5-6 weeks following core surgery, Michal Neuvirth becomes the primary goaltending option in Philadelphia. We know that he is capable of going on world-beating runs and it cannot be ruled out for a Flyers team that has been awfully competitive in the second half.</p>\n<p>The Flyers don\u2019t have a back-to-back until early March, so Neuvirth is in line to get all the starts up to the trade deadline. That probably isn\u2019t enough of a sample size with which the Flyers front office can really assess things, so they may also want to get one more look at backup Alex Lyon before the deadline, just to be sure they are comfortable with this tandem.</p>\n<p>They should be looking to add a goaltender for insurance, especially because of Neuvirth\u2019s own injury woes. However, the Flyers have been very patient with their rebuild and likely are unwilling to throw major assets at this issue.</p>\n<p>12. Lars Eller has 14 points in his last 20 games. He has 29 points on the season and his career high is 30. Four of those 14 points are via the power play. He\u2019s seeing secondary PP time this year after not seeing much at all in three prior campaigns.</p>\n<p>At 28 years old, he could be finally showing a bit of the potential that we thought he had when he was 20. Not that he\u2019s going to Josh Bailey or Brad Marchand his way to stardom suddenly in his late 20s but on a team in need of depth scoring such as Washington, I can see him surprising next year with 50 points. Man, that seems bold just re-reading it. But I\u2019m just not used to seeing a solid 18-game run from him like this. </p>\n<p>13. I think Jean-Gabriel Pageau will go. I think he\u2019s a fit for the Penguins and is totally GM Jim Rutherford\u2019s MO. If they acquire him, he\u2019ll be the third-line centre. which is a huge upgrade in terms of fit and an upgrade to last year\u2019s Nick Bonino. It would also allow Jake Guentzel to go back to the wing in the top-six, providing his owners with solid end-of-season production. </p>\n<p>14. Gustav Nyquist, like many Red Wings, was (stupidly) given a no-trade clause. The Wings have to get out of some of these, so why not ask him to waive it? He is signed through 2018-19 and then becomes unrestricted. The Wings could really restock the shelves with a couple of picks and/or prospects that they would get in return. He hasn\u2019t turned out to be the star they\u2019d hoped he would become by now. </p>\n<p>15. I remain in on Max Domi as a rebound candidate for next season. I am now batting around the theory that at least some of his struggles are related to a move to centre. Domi started out the year well with 10 points in the first 14 games, playing on the wing opposite Clayton Keller, but then disappeared. Around Christmas, the Coyotes shifted him to centre. His most regular linemates have been guys like Zac Rinaldo and Tobias Rieder. Not exactly ideal circumstances.</p>\n<p>Hopefully we don\u2019t have another Alex Galchenyuk situation where a team can\u2019t decide if a top youngster is a centreman or a winger. And hopefully we don\u2019t go through the same dance with Keller in a couple of years. They do seem committed to Domi at centre. His struggles came before this shift but I don\u2019t think it has helped him get back on track either.</p>\n<p>16. Florida\u2019s Vincent Trocheck\u2019s 22 goals put him three back of a career high, which he\u2019ll surely eclipse. He is a strong bet to get to 30. He\u2019s been awesome for a couple of years but he hasn\u2019t been able to get consistent top unit PP time. He\u2019s getting it now (in his magical fourth year) and has emerged with a career-high 16 PP points already. </p>\n<div id=\"video_container-981409\" class=\"sn-video-container \">\n<div class=\"bc_shortcode_placeholder\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n        var adServerUrl = \"\";\n        var $el = $( \"#video_container-981409\" );\n        var permalink = $el.closest('.snet-single-article').data('permalink');</p>\n<p>        if ( \"1\" == true && 'undefined' !== typeof window.getIndexAds ) {\n            var so = {preroll:{1:{1:{siteID:191888},2:{siteID:191889}}}};\n            adServerUrl = window.getIndexAds( 'http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x360&iu=%2F7326%2Fen.sportsnet.web%2FVideo&ciu_szs=300x250&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&ad_rule=1&vid=5732421852001&cmsid=384', so, permalink);\n        } else {\n            adServerUrl = \"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x360&iu=%2F7326%2Fen.sportsnet.web%2FVideo&ciu_szs=300x250&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&ad_rule=1&vid=5732421852001&cmsid=384\";\n        }</p>\n<p>        $el.after( unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\\\"\" + (document.location.protocol == \"https:\" ? \"https://sb\" : \"http://b\") + \".scorecardresearch.com/beacon.js\\\" %3E%3C/script%3E\") );</p>\n<p>        $( document ).one( 'ready', function() {\n            $( \"#video_container-981409\" ).SNPlayer( {\n                bc_account_id: \"1704050871\",\n                bc_player_id: \"rkedLxwfab\",\n                //autoplay: false, \n                //is_has_autoplay_switch: false,\n                bc_videos: 5732421852001, \n                is_has_continuous_play: \"false\",\n                adserverurl: adServerUrl,\n                section: \"\",\n                thumbnail: \"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1704050871_5732425694001_5732421852001-vs-1024x576.jpg\",\n                direct_url: \"http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/trochecks-1st-career-hat-trick-comes-3rd-period-oilers/\"\n            });\n        });\n    </script></p>\n<p>17. Yanni Gourde has points in 11 of his last 13. His upside is ever-changing in my mind. I was high on him as a prospect; loved the way he worked his way up from being undrafted. Then last year, I saw him in a couple of AHL games and came away unimpressed.</p>\n<p>So, when he started the season, I had his upside at 70 points. But he\u2019s on pace for 62 as a rookie. Does that mean 80 is feasible in several years? I\u2019ve often maintained that Gourde was similar to Jonathan Marchessault in terms of \u2018against all odds\u2019 and \u2018just needs a chance\u2019. But while Marchessault never got a chance with Tampa, other than a brief 10-game stint when Tyler Johnson was hurt, Gourde is getting that chance. So, the Lightning gets to enjoy Gourde\u2019s breakout after missing out on Marchessault\u2019s. </p>\n<p>18. I was concerned about Mikhail Sergachev\u2019s limited usage all year and it really seems to have caught up. He hasn\u2019t scored a goal since December 16. He has just eight assists in his last 25 games and even suffered from a couple of healthy scratchings. Seems like you could gain some benefit from looking elsewhere. </p>\n<p>19. Wild&#8217;s Eric Staal has 52 points in 58 games this season. To note here is that Staal\u2019s ice time has gone down nearly a minute since the holiday break. So, fantasy owners have a decision to make. Does Staal maintain solid production now that his top winger, Nino Niederreiter, has returned to his line from injury, or does his shooting percentage being so high, and shot rates declining, indicate a player who should be moved? I would lean to moving but it always depends on the return. Don\u2019t just give him away.</p>\n<p>20. Jack Eichel\u2019s injury is brutal for fantasy hockey owners. Eichel had 21 points in his last 19 games, 53 points on the year, was going to push for 20 power-play points, and was going to soar past 250 shots on goal. You can\u2019t replace that on the waiver wire.</p>\n<p>For those that don\u2019t own the Sabres\u2019 star in keeper leagues, now is the time to buy if the person who does own him is in the hunt for first place. If that person doesn\u2019t want to move him, so be it, but they should be motivated to do so. Dobber has him as a top-10 keeper skater in his most recent rankings update and I concur. Even if it\u2019s 90 cents on the dollar, now is the best time to go trade for him.</p>\n<p>One player to look into with Jack Eichel out: Ryan O\u2019Reilly, whom we should expect to play ludicrous minutes over the next month or so. The do-it-all centerman is already averaging 20:29 per game (10th in the league among forwards). There\u2019s already a blueprint for what O\u2019Reilly might look like with Eichel out. In the two months that Eichel missed last season. O\u2019Reilly averaged 22 minutes and 3.5 SOG per game. If O\u2019Reilly can replicate the shot rate he put up without Eichel last season, then he can offer roughly 75 percent of what Eichel was.</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Hockey</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues>\n\t\t\t<league>NHL</league>\n\t\t</leagues>\n\n\t\t<teams/>\t</item>\n\n\t<item  importance=\"normal\">\n\n<media:content medium=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Jin-Young-Ko.jpg\" />\n<media:credit>Lee Jin-man/AP</media:credit>\n<media:title>Jin-Young-Ko</media:title>\n<enclosure url=\"http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Jin-Young-Ko.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t\t<title>South Korea&#8217;s Jin Young Ko wins Australian Open</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.sportsnet.ca/golf/south-koreas-jin-young-ko-wins-australian-open/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.sportsnet.ca/golf/south-koreas-jin-young-ko-wins-australian-open//#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 04:39:33 EST</pubDate>\n\t\t<modifiedDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 04:39:33 EST</modifiedDate >\n\t\t<dc:creator>Associated Press</dc:creator>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\"><![CDATA[https://www.sportsnet.ca/?post_type=sn-article&#038;p=3893793&#038;oc=-1]]></guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>South Korea&#8217;s Jin Young Ko shot a 3-under par 69 Sunday to clinch a 3-shot, start-to-finish win the Women&#8217;s Australian Open.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>ADELAIDE, Australia &#8212; South Korea&#8217;s Jin Young Ko shot a 3-under par 69 Sunday to clinch a 3-shot, start-to-finish win the Women&#8217;s Australian Open.</p>\n<p>    Playing in her first tournament as a full LPGA member, Ko shot 65, 69, 71, 69 to lead after all four rounds and to finish with a total of 274, 14-under par at the Kooyonga Golf Club. She is the first player to win her first tournament as an LPGA member in the tour&#8217;s 67-year history.</p>\n<p>    Ko started the day four shots clear of 21-year-old Hannah Green, who was bidding to become the first Australian to win her national crown since Karrie Webb won the last of her five titles in 2014.</p>\n<p>    Green played solidly in the final group with Ko, shooting 69 and missing a birdie on the 18th which cost her a share of second place.</p>\n<p>    The stiffest challenge Sunday came from Ko&#8217;s compatriot Hyejin Choi who closed within a shot at the turn, carding four birdies on her first nine holes. Ko began with birdies at the first and second holes, then stumbled with bogeys on the par-3 third and seventh holes.</p>\n<p>    But just as her lead came under threat, she found another gear, birdying the ninth hole to regain a two-shot lead. She then pulled away with birdies at the 13th and 17th in what seemed a nerveless finish, showing the experience gained as a 10-time winner on the Korean LPGA Tour.</p>\n<p>    She ended with a regulation par on the 18th to claim her second LPGA title after previously winning the co-sanctioned KEB-Hana Bank Championship.</p>\n<p>    Ko said she felt &#34;lots&#34; of nerves over the final round. Asked her reaction when she holed out on 18, she said &#34;relief.&#34;</p>\n<p>    &#34;I thought I could do it but I felt I had to play my game and enjoy the game,&#34; Ko said. &#34;My goal this week was firstly to make the cut and second to enjoy the game.</p>\n<p>    &#34;But I won this week so I don&#8217;t know what that might mean. My goal is Rookie of the Year.&#34; Asked by a reporter whether Player of the Year was a realistic option, Ko replied: &#34;No, not yet.&#34;</p>\n<p>    Ko started the tournament ranked 20 but could be close to the top-10 by the start of the next LPGA tour stop in Thailand next weekend.</p>\n<p>    Choi was relentless in pursuit, the only player other than Ko to beat par in all four rounds. She shot 69, 71, 70, 67 on the par-72 layout, finishing at 277, 11 under par.</p>\n<p>    Green, in her rookie season, had rounds of 69, 74, 66, 69 to finish third at 10-under, one shot ahead of compatriot Katherine Kirk, who finished with a 7-under 65, the day&#8217;s best round.</p>\n<p>    &#34;I started off really well,&#34; Green said. &#34;My goal was to get into every major and I know that&#8217;s quite hard being a rookie this year. So hopefully I&#8217;ve made enough money and keep making money to ensure I&#8217;m definitely in.&#34;</p>\n ]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t<sports>\n\t\t\t<sport>Golf</sport>\n\t\t</sports>\n\t\t<leagues>\n\t\t\t<league>LPGA Tour</league>\n\t\t</leagues>\n\n\t\t<teams/>\t</item>\n\n\t</channel>\n</rss>",
