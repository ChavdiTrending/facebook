Considering that there are many memories attached to our school, the place is really close to our heart. Well, it is no different for Rani Mukerji. The actress studied in Maneckji Cooper in Juhu and now she is all set to return there. And the reason behind this is her forthcoming film <em>Hichki</em>. How? Let us tell you.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-816522 size-full\" title=\"Rani Mukerji decided to go back to her school and it is because of Hichki\" src=\"http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Rani-Hichki.jpg\" alt=\"Rani Mukerji decided to go back to her school and it is because of Hichki\" width=\"620\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n<p>Rani Mukerji will be launching the first song from her film <em>Hichki</em> titled <em>'Oye Hichki'</em> in Maneckji Cooper. The actress has always maintained that her school played an important role in her life. It is where she learnt her values. She also credits the place for shaping her into what she is today.</p>\n<p>It is a known fact that Rani Mukerji is on a promotional spree currently for her forthcoming film <em>Hichki</em>. Acknowledges the significance of her school years in her career and life, the actress expressed her gratitude towards all the teachers. She is thankful to them for imparting her with the right values that she grew up with. She believes that these values lets her stand up for what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right and enables her to raise her voice against social discrimination and prejudice.</p>\n<p>As tribute to the positive influence that her school, Maneckji Cooper, Juhu had on her, Rani will revisit her school. She will even be meeting the students and teachers and interacting with them. She will discuss on how school helps in imparting the right education and sensitiveness to tackle social stigmas.</p>\n<p>Speaking about her plans, Rani said, \u00e2\u0080\u009c<em>Hichki</em> is about overcoming our weaknesses by turning them to strengths. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a story that can motivate change in the way we think about people around us, and also our own-selves. I was deeply impacted by the positive education I received from my own teachers. I have drawn inspiration to play the character of a school teacher in <em>Hichki</em> from them.

I feel proud to take the message of <em>Hichki</em> to the students and teachers of my school.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n\r\nRani plays the character of Naina Mathur who has a nervous system disorder, Tourette Syndrome.

He lost his father and veteran actor Vinod Khanna last year to cancer. While he is still recovering from the personal loss, the actor is on his way to revive his Bollywood career. The actor, after films like Dishoom and Ittefaq, is now all set for another intriguing role. He will be seen as a lawyer in <em>Section 375: Marzi Ya Jabardasti\u00c2\u00a0</em>along with Richa Chadha</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-816510 size-full\" title=\"REVEALED: Akshaye Kumar and Richa Chadha to play lawyers in court room drama on rape\" src=\"http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Akshaye-Richa-film.jpg\" alt=\"REVEALED: Akshaye Kumar and Richa Chadha to play lawyers in court room drama on rape\" width=\"620\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n<p>The film in question will be directed by <em>Rahasya</em> fame Manish Gupta. The film revolves around the debate of how women often misuse rape laws. These stringent laws are created by the government for the protection of female gender. But there are many who use its loopholes for their own personal benefit. The film <em>Section 375: Marzi Ya Jabardasti</em> explores these two aspects of the same coins. It is inspired by 10 real life cases.</p>\n<p>Speaking on getting Akshaye Khanna on board, Manish revealed that he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t looking for a quintessential hero. His requirements were that of an intelligent guy who looks approximately 40 years old. For him, Akshaye was the perfect match for the role of a suave SoBo [South Mumbai] lawyer who is fluent in English. On the other hand, Richa Chadha will be seen as a public prosecutor.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, this will be the first time where Akshaye Khanna and Richa Chadha will be sharing screen space. Considering that both these actors are considered to be powerhouse performers, it will be an interesting watch to see them battle it out in the court room.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Manish Gupta revealed that he has undergone extensive research for the film. From meeting alleged rape accused to survivors, he even explained the process of a special court. It has a female judge who is generally appointed only to hear rape cases. Talking about the same Manish says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRape laws are being misused by men and women alike leaving the judiciary and police confused as to which rape case is genuine and which is fake.\" Further adding about the research he underwent the filmmaker adds, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are special courts with female judges who only hear rape cases. I have also met survivors, their families, alleged rapists and lawyers representing both sides\" he says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very disturbing not only for the accused and the survivors but also their families.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>Furthermore, talking about the film, it brings forth the much discussed debate on rape and consensual sex. Manish also asserted that the suspense of whether it was rape or consensual will keep the audience gripped till the end. He also stated that both the lawyers will have ample evidence to back up their case.</p>\n<p><em>Section 375: Marzi Ya Jabardasti</em> is said to be produced by Abhishek Pathak, son of producer Kumar Mangat. Pathak revealed that he was super impressed with the script and was immediately drawn to the idea. Hence he decided to back the project. \"I have seen Manish\u00e2\u0080\u0099s <em>Rahasya</em> and we thought it was a great film. We know what he will be able to achieve with this script. When he came to us, we were drawn by the idea of Section 375 and decided to back the project.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0Further details on the film aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t available as of now. The film is expected to go on floor in March \u00e2\u0080\u0093 April this year.</p>\n<h4>Also Read:\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/features/rogues-gallery-evil-pays-lead-actors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rogues\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Gallery: When \u00e2\u0080\u0098Evil Pays\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0094for lead actors</a></h4>\n ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[\n                <!doctype html>\n                <html lang=\"en\" prefix=\"op: http://media.facebook.com/op#\">\n                  <head>\n                    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">  \n                        <link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/bollywood/revealed-akshaye-khanna-richa-chadha-play-lawyers-court-room-drama-rape/\">\n                    <meta property=\"op:markup_version\" content=\"v1.0\">\n                  </head>\n                  <body>\n                    <article>\n                      <header>\n                        REVEALED: Akshaye Khanna and Richa Chadha to play lawyers in court room drama on rape\n                      </header>\n                      <figure class=\"op-tracker\">\n\t\t\t\t        <iframe>\n\t\t\t\t           \n\t\t\t\t        </iframe>\n\n\t\t\t\t        </figure>\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n                      Akshaye Khanna faced several ups and downs in his life in the past few years.

He will be seen as a lawyer in <em>Section 375: Marzi Ya Jabardasti\u00c2\u00a0</em>along with Richa Chadha\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-816510 size-full\" title=\"REVEALED: Akshaye Kumar and Richa Chadha to play lawyers in court room drama on rape\" src=\"http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Akshaye-Richa-film.jpg\" alt=\"REVEALED: Akshaye Kumar and Richa Chadha to play lawyers in court room drama on rape\" width=\"620\" height=\"450\" />\r\n\r\nThe film in question will be directed by <em>Rahasya</em> fame Manish Gupta. The film revolves around the debate of how women often misuse rape laws. These stringent laws are created by the government for the protection of female gender. But there are many who use its loopholes for their own personal benefit. The film <em>Section 375: Marzi Ya Jabardasti</em> explores these two aspects of the same coins. It is inspired by 10 real life cases.\r\n\r\nSpeaking on getting Akshaye Khanna on board, Manish revealed that he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t looking for a quintessential hero. His requirements were that of an intelligent guy who looks approximately 40 years old. For him, Akshaye was the perfect match for the role of a suave SoBo [South Mumbai] lawyer who is fluent in English. On the other hand, Richa Chadha will be seen as a public prosecutor.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, this will be the first time where Akshaye Khanna and Richa Chadha will be sharing screen space. Considering that both these actors are considered to be powerhouse performers, it will be an interesting watch to see them battle it out in the court room.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Manish Gupta revealed that he has undergone extensive research for the film. From meeting alleged rape accused to survivors, he even explained the process of a special court. It has a female judge who is generally appointed only to hear rape cases. Talking about the same Manish says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRape laws are being misused by men and women alike leaving the judiciary and police confused as to which rape case is genuine and which is fake.\" Further adding about the research he underwent the filmmaker adds, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are special courts with female judges who only hear rape cases. I have also met survivors, their families, alleged rapists and lawyers representing both sides\" he says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very disturbing not only for the accused and the survivors but also their families.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n\r\nFurthermore, talking about the film, it brings forth the much discussed debate on rape and consensual sex. Manish also asserted that the suspense of whether it was rape or consensual will keep the audience gripped till the end. He also stated that both the lawyers will have ample evidence to back up their case.\r\n\r\n<em>Section 375: Marzi Ya Jabardasti</em> is said to be produced by Abhishek Pathak, son of producer Kumar Mangat. Pathak revealed that he was super impressed with the script and was immediately drawn to the idea. Hence he decided to back the project. \"I have seen Manish\u00e2\u0080\u0099s <em>Rahasya</em> and we thought it was a great film. We know what he will be able to achieve with this script. When he came to us, we were drawn by the idea of Section 375 and decided to back the project.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0Further details on the film aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t available as of now. The film is expected to go on floor in March \u00e2\u0080\u0093 April this year.\r\n<h4>Also Read:\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/features/rogues-gallery-evil-pays-lead-actors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rogues\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Gallery: When \u00e2\u0080\u0098Evil Pays\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0094for lead actors</a></h4><footer>\n\n                      </footer>\n                    </article>\n                  </body>\n                </html>\n                ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[ Akshay Kumar and KriArj get together for another project ]]></title><link><![CDATA[ http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/bollywood/akshay-kumar-kriarj-get-together-another-project/]]></link><pubDate><![CDATA[ Sat, 17 Feb 18 05:06:20 +0000 ]]></pubDate><author><![CDATA[ Subhash K.

The director after several discussions roped in Tiger Shroff to play the lead. The poster that was released last year was welcomed with much appreciation. However, there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much progress on the film front. But now we hear that the Hindi version, <em>Rambo</em>, will kick off in 2019.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-815778 size-full\" title=\"Tiger Shroff in Rambo\" src=\"http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rambo_tiger.jpg\" alt=\"Tiger Shroff in Rambo\" width=\"620\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n<p>Recent reports claim that <em>Rambo</em> was to go on floor in December, 2017. However, owing to the hectic schedules of Tiger Shroff and Siddharth Anand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work commitments, it couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be possible. But now, Siddharth has finally confirmed that the film will kick off by November 2019. Yes, fans will have to wait for almost two years before they will get to see Tiger don the Rambo avatar.</p>\n<p>Based on the David Morrell novel \u00e2\u0080\u0098First Blood\u00e2\u0080\u0099, the original <em>Rambo</em> starred Sylvester Stallone as John Rambo, a troubled Vietnam War veteran. Rambo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character has worked as former U.S. Army Special Forces soldier.

The director after several discussions roped in Tiger Shroff to play the lead. The poster that was released last year was welcomed with much appreciation. However, there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much progress on the film front. But now we hear that the Hindi version, <em>Rambo</em>, will kick off in 2019.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-815778 size-full\" title=\"Tiger Shroff in Rambo\" src=\"http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rambo_tiger.jpg\" alt=\"Tiger Shroff in Rambo\" width=\"620\" height=\"450\" />\r\n\r\nRecent reports claim that <em>Rambo</em> was to go on floor in December, 2017. However, owing to the hectic schedules of Tiger Shroff and Siddharth Anand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work commitments, it couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be possible. But now, Siddharth has finally confirmed that the film will kick off by November 2019. Yes, fans will have to wait for almost two years before they will get to see Tiger don the Rambo avatar.\r\n\r\nBased on the David Morrell novel \u00e2\u0080\u0098First Blood\u00e2\u0080\u0099, the original <em>Rambo</em> starred Sylvester Stallone as John Rambo, a troubled Vietnam War veteran. Rambo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character has worked as former U.S. Army Special Forces soldier. Hence, he is skilled in many aspects of survival, weaponry, hand-to-hand combat and guerrilla warfare.\r\n\r\nFurther talking about the Hindi remake, Anand also revealed that it will be shot extensively in Europe and Himalayas. Earlier, when he had announced the film, the filmmaker had maintained that <em>Rambo</em> will be a trilogy. There were also speculations that Hrithik Roshan might be playing the lead role. However, the deal didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t materialize and later, Tiger was brought on board.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, before kick starting <em>Rambo</em>, Siddharth Anand is already working with Tiger Shroff in YRF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s untitled next.

Anupam has decided to change his character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are a lot of Indians across the world who watch <em>Bellvue</em>. Calling me \u00e2\u0080\u0098Dr Anil Kapoor\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in the series would have seemed gimmicky to them.

Of course Anil asking for royalty was a joke, But so much was made out of it.

It was Kamal Amrohi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mahal in 1949 which gave Madhubala the image of an ethereal unattainable yet warm and gregarious beauty who could be diva and the devil at the same time.

The chiselled beauty who won not only Prince Salim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart but thousands of hearts in Mughal-e-Azam always had a problem with her heart. She had fallen in love with the Thespian Dilip Kumar. They were signed together for B.R.Chopra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rustic romance Naya Daur. But when Madhubala refused to shoot outdoors due to her failing health, she was dragged to court where Dilip Kumar made a public declaration of his love for the beauteous damsel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will love her until the SHE dies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thereby pre-empting her inevitable end.</p>\n<h1><strong>The aura lives on...</strong></h1>\n<p>Why are the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most beautiful women doomed to destruction at a shockingly young? Whether it was Marilyn Monroe in Hollywood or Meena Kumari and Madhubala in Mumbai, they all perished before reaching the age of 40. Madhubala has remained etched in public memory as the timeless beauty who enthralled audiences in Mahal, Mr &amp; Mrs 55, Howrah Bridge and of course Mughal-e-Azam where she had to wear heavy iron chains in spite of doctors warning her against such strain due to heart condition. Madhubala\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last released film was Jwala with Sunil Dutt in 1970. By then she was already gone. The legend of course lives on, as does stories of impish personality and incessant giggles from those who had the privilege of knowing her personally.</p>\n<p>Yash Chopra had the opportunity to direct Madhubala for his brother B.R.Chopra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s film Naya Daur before she was replaced by Vyjanthimala.

The legend of course lives on, as does stories of impish personality and incessant giggles from those who had the privilege of knowing her personally.\r\n\r\nYash Chopra had the opportunity to direct Madhubala for his brother B.R.Chopra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s film Naya Daur before she was replaced by Vyjanthimala. He can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget that brief interlude with her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe was there for a while\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and then she was gone!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says, putting his finger on Madhubala\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brief romance with fame and life.\r\n\r\n<strong>Also Read:<a href=\"http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/features/shah-rukh-khan-pays-late-night-visit-veteran-actor-dilip-kumar/\">\u00c2\u00a0Shah Rukh Khan pays late night visit to veteran actor Dilip Kumar</a></strong><footer>\n\n                      </footer>\n                    </article>\n                  </body>\n                </html>\n                ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[ Sunny Leone PROTECTS a farmer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s land by turning into a scarecrow! ]]></title><link><![CDATA[ http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/bollywood/sunny-leone-protects-farmers-land-turning-scarecrow/]]></link><pubDate><![CDATA[ Wed, 14 Feb 18 09:50:39 +0000 ]]></pubDate><author><![CDATA[ Bollywood Hungama News Network ]]></author><media:thumbnail url=\"http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Sunny-Leone-PROTECTS-a-farmer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-land-by-turning-into-a-scarecrow.jpg\" /><description><![CDATA[ <p>Charm surrounding Sunny Leone is truly mesmerising!

However, he had ended the same with a promise that he would return. Now it is time to fulfil the promise! Yes, Kapil Sharma is all set for his new show on the Sony entertainment channel and this time it will be all about family</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-814902 size-full\" title=\"Kapil Sharma returns with a new comedy show and his new format is all about loving the family\" src=\"http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Kapil-Sharma-returns-with-a-new-comedy-show-and-his-new-format-is-all-about-loving-the-family.jpg\" alt=\"Kapil Sharma returns with a new comedy show and his new format is all about loving the family\" width=\"620\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n<p>Yes, the stand-up comedian turned actor will revive his association with the channel with this new series. However, this one will be a brand new one with a new format. Titled Family Time with Kapil Sharma, the format will have audiences performing fun and entertaining activities with other members.</p>\n<p>Kapil Sharma too will reunite with his onscreen family members, namely Kiku Sharda and Chandan Prabhakar. Furthermore, the channel too has decided to move forward with this venture despite the alleged fallout with Sharma.</p>\n<p>For the uninitiated, the channel faced a tough time with Kapil after many A-list celebs complained of constant shoot cancellations of his previous show. Kapil allegedly continued to cancel shoots owing to his ill health.

However, he had ended the same with a promise that he would return. Now it is time to fulfil the promise! Yes, Kapil Sharma is all set for his new show on the Sony entertainment channel and this time it will be all about family\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-814902 size-full\" title=\"Kapil Sharma returns with a new comedy show and his new format is all about loving the family\" src=\"http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Kapil-Sharma-returns-with-a-new-comedy-show-and-his-new-format-is-all-about-loving-the-family.jpg\" alt=\"Kapil Sharma returns with a new comedy show and his new format is all about loving the family\" width=\"620\" height=\"450\" />\r\n\r\nYes, the stand-up comedian turned actor will revive his association with the channel with this new series. However, this one will be a brand new one with a new format. Titled Family Time with Kapil Sharma, the format will have audiences performing fun and entertaining activities with other members.\r\n\r\nKapil Sharma too will reunite with his onscreen family members, namely Kiku Sharda and Chandan Prabhakar. Furthermore, the channel too has decided to move forward with this venture despite the alleged fallout with Sharma.\r\n\r\nFor the uninitiated, the channel faced a tough time with Kapil after many A-list celebs complained of constant shoot cancellations of his previous show. Kapil allegedly continued to cancel shoots owing to his ill health.

Instead, he announced that he would like to take over the project. KriArj entrusted the making and line production of the film to GUY IN THE SKY PICTURES(GITSP), which is a company owned\u00c2\u00a0 by films' director Abhishek Kapoor (Gattu). Since the shoot was not properly planned and neither properly executed, it has resulted in the budgets being increased manifold. Further, GITSP was not able to accommodate and plan their actor's dates, which resulted in further delay thereby adding to KriArj's woes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-814748 size-full\" title=\"Inside Story: What went wrong between Kedarnath director Abhishek Kapoor and producers at KriArj?\" src=\"http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Inside-Story-What-went-wrong-between-Kedarnath-director-Abhishek-Kapoor-and-producers-at-KriArj.jpg\" alt=\"Inside Story: What went wrong between Kedarnath director Abhishek Kapoor and producers at KriArj?\" width=\"620\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n<p>Additionally, as per sources, the fallout is due to the high price for music and digital rights expected by GITSP. Apparently, Kapoor has asked for Rs. 40 crores for the same.</p>\n<p>Says the source, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe team of KriArj has been constantly after GITSP team to provide all the bills and statements of accounts, and despite several meetings and reminders, they have failed. KrArj is the rightful owner of the film and Mr Kapoor cannot come forward to take over the project until he settles all the bills and clears all of the producers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 dues.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>The friction between Kapoor and Kriarj has been building up for some time now. Kapoor recently incensed his producers Kriarj and T Series by rigidly declaring the release of <em>Kedarnath</em> alongside the Shah Rukh Khan starrer <em>Zero</em> during Christmas 2018.</p>\n<p>Says the source, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGattu further created confusion in the release date when he insisted that <em>Kedarnath</em> would clash with SRK's <em>Zero,</em> a decision stoutly opposed by the producers which Gattu didn't want to budge against. Moreover he had to deliver the final finished film in June 2018, which he clearly cannot do. To cover up his incompetence and failure, apparently Gattu, in his arrogance also abused his producers. This led to no option for Kriarj, but to stop the funds and pull out the plug, and stop the film.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>The current imbroglio between Abhishek Kapoor and his producers KriArj and T Series could prove costly for all concerned.

Instead, he announced that he would like to take over the project. KriArj entrusted the making and line production of the film to GUY IN THE SKY PICTURES(GITSP), which is a company owned\u00c2\u00a0 by films' director Abhishek Kapoor (Gattu). Since the shoot was not properly planned and neither properly executed, it has resulted in the budgets being increased manifold. Further, GITSP was not able to accommodate and plan their actor's dates, which resulted in further delay thereby adding to KriArj's woes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-814748 size-full\" title=\"Inside Story: What went wrong between Kedarnath director Abhishek Kapoor and producers at KriArj?\" src=\"http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Inside-Story-What-went-wrong-between-Kedarnath-director-Abhishek-Kapoor-and-producers-at-KriArj.jpg\" alt=\"Inside Story: What went wrong between Kedarnath director Abhishek Kapoor and producers at KriArj?\" width=\"620\" height=\"450\" />\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as per sources, the fallout is due to the high price for music and digital rights expected by GITSP. Apparently, Kapoor has asked for Rs. 40 crores for the same.\r\n\r\nSays the source, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe team of KriArj has been constantly after GITSP team to provide all the bills and statements of accounts, and despite several meetings and reminders, they have failed. KrArj is the rightful owner of the film and Mr Kapoor cannot come forward to take over the project until he settles all the bills and clears all of the producers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 dues.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n\r\nThe friction between Kapoor and Kriarj has been building up for some time now. Kapoor recently incensed his producers Kriarj and T Series by rigidly declaring the release of <em>Kedarnath</em> alongside the Shah Rukh Khan starrer <em>Zero</em> during Christmas 2018.\r\n\r\nSays the source, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGattu further created confusion in the release date when he insisted that <em>Kedarnath</em> would clash with SRK's <em>Zero,</em> a decision stoutly opposed by the producers which Gattu didn't want to budge against. Moreover he had to deliver the final finished film in June 2018, which he clearly cannot do. To cover up his incompetence and failure, apparently Gattu, in his arrogance also abused his producers. This led to no option for Kriarj, but to stop the funds and pull out the plug, and stop the film.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n\r\nThe current imbroglio between Abhishek Kapoor and his producers KriArj and T Series could prove costly for all concerned. It also jeopardizes the career of Saif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter Sara Khan who makes her debut opposite Sushant Singh Rajput in the movie.\r\n\r\nSays our source at KriArj, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are passionate filmmakers. They tried level-best to get things sorted with Abhishek Kapoor, as one family, in fact are still trying to do the same. The rest is clearly in the hands of God.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n\r\nWould <em>Kedarnath</em> survive this clash? It should be noted that the director has earlier warred, legally with his producers Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani over <em>Rock</em> <em>On 2</em> and more recently had a massive conflict of interest with his producers UTV over <em>Fitoor,</em> his massive flop.\r\n\r\n<strong>Also Read:\u00c2\u00a0</strong><a href=\"http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/bollywood/abhishek-kapoor-breaks-silence-kedarnath-release-date-controversy/\">Abhishek Kapoor breaks silence on Kedarnath release date controversy</a><footer>\n\n                      </footer>\n                    </article>\n                  </body>\n                </html>\n                ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[ Exclusive: The REAL reason why Akshay Kumar is not doing the Verghese Kurien biopic ]]></title><link><![CDATA[ http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/bollywood/exclusive-real-reason-akshay-kumar-not-verghese-kurien-biopic/]]></link><pubDate><![CDATA[ Tue, 13 Feb 18 05:18:38 +0000 ]]></pubDate><author><![CDATA[ Subhash K.

The producer has now been presented with a rare Italian honour by the consulate. Undoubtedly, he attended the ceremony, accompanied by his wife Warda Nadiadwala.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-814609 size-full\" title=\"Check out: Sajid Nadiadwala receives the Volare Award from Italian Consulate\" src=\"http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Check-out-Sajid-Nadiadwala-receives-the-Volare-Award-from-Italian-Consulate.jpg\" alt=\"Check out: Sajid Nadiadwala receives the Volare Award from Italian Consulate\" width=\"620\" height=\"623\" />\r\n\r\nSajid Nadiadwala was presented with the Volare Award by none other than the Italian ambassador in India, Mr. Lorenzo Angeloni amidst the presence of President of Italian Film Commission Ms. Stefania Ippoliti. The said award is to felicitate the work and achievements of filmmakers who played a key role in fostering the India-Italy friendship.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-814608\" src=\"http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Check-out-Sajid-Nadiadwala-receives-the-Volare-Award-from-Italian-Consulate-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"1022\" />\r\n\r\nIn other words, filmmakers who use Italy as an integral part of their films often are presented with this honour. Sajid Nadiadwala has used the picturesque locations of this country in his films like <em>Housefull</em> and <em>Kambhakkt Ishq</em>. In fact, the latter even starred Sylvester Stallone in a guest appearance.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-814610\" src=\"http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Check-out-Sajid-Nadiadwala-receives-the-Volare-Award-from-Italian-Consulate-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"620\" />\r\n\r\nInterestingly, this is not the first time where the producer has been felicitated with a foreign award. He has previously been awarded by the Italian consulate itself and also the French consulate for his work in the field of art, culture and films.\r\n\r\nTalking about his forthcoming films, Sajid Nadiadwala has announced the fourth instalment of <em>Housefull</em>. <em>Housefull 4</em> marks the return of Sajid Khan as the director and is a funny take on reincarnation. Yet another venture that fans are eagerly looking forward to is <em>Kick 2</em>.
