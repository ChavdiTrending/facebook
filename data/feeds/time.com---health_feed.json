That&#8217;s no reason for health officials to celebrate yet: That level is among the highest in a decade. But it&#8217;s no worse than last week, and flu activity had been increasing each week since November.</p>\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm\"  target=\"_blank\">report</a> said the number of states reporting heavy flu patient traffic also held steady at 43.<br />\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"></div></div></p>\n<p>&#8220;I thought I was going to die, I really did,&#8221; said Ben Bland, a 39-year-old event planner in Kansas City, Missouri, who was hospitalized this week with pneumonia on top of flu. &#8220;My lungs felt like they were going to blow out of my esophagus every time I coughed. My body ached head to toe.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This season started early and has been driven by a formidable type of flu that tends to put more people in the hospital and cause more deaths. Making a bad year worse, this year&#8217;s flu vaccine is estimated to be only 25 percent effective against that type.</p>\n<p>Preliminary data released last week indicated patient traffic in doctor&#8217;s offices and emergency rooms this flu season was as bad as the height of the swine flu pandemic in 2009. However, the CDC readjusted its numbers down slightly in Friday&#8217;s report, meaning this season did not quite match the intensity of flu activity seen in October 2009.</p>\n<p>Still, it counts as one of the most intense flu seasons in more than a decade. Whether it&#8217;s peaking or not, flu season is still expected to last several more weeks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are not out of the woods yet. We are not seeing any increase, and that is encouraging. But there still is a lot of flu happening out there,&#8221; said Dr. Daniel Jernigan, the CDC&#8217;s influenza chief. He said people should stay home from work or school if they get sick to prevent spreading flu, and people should still get vaccinated if they haven&#8217;t already. Even though the vaccine is not as powerful as officials hoped, it can lessen the illness&#8217;s severity, keep people out of the hospital, and save lives.</p>\n<p>Flu remained widespread in every state except Oregon and Hawaii, the same as the week before.</p>\n<p>The new report shows that for the week ending Jan. 27, just under 10 percent of U.S. death certificates listed flu or pneumonia. That&#8217;s down slightly from the week before, but indicates that flu remains at epidemic levels. There are as many as 56,000 deaths connected to the flu during a bad year.</p>\n<p>Eighty-four children have died so far. Childhood deaths have reached about 170 in a season.</p>\n<p>Figures released Thursday suggest this year&#8217;s flu vaccine has worked fairly well in children younger than 9. That was no comfort to parents with sick children.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s horrible to see your child with a breathing mask on her face,&#8221; said Stephanie Calvin, 35, of Mandeville, Louisiana, whose 4-year-old daughter has been sick with flu for four weeks.</p>\n<p>Calvin has taken four days of unpaid time off work to care for her daughter, alternating with her husband. &#8220;I&#8217;m a mom before I&#8217;m an employee. It was a no-brainer to stay home with her.&#8221;</p>\n</article>\n</section>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/flu-virus.jpg?quality=85\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/flu-virus.jpg?quality=85\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Influenza viruses illustration</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>22 More Kids Died From the Flu Last Week, the CDC Says</title>\n\t\t<link>http://time.com/5163409/flu-pediatric-deaths/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 20:15:42 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jamie Ducharme]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[healthytime]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[onetime]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[public health]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://time.com/?p=5163409</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[It was the deadliest week of flu season for kids]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5163409\"></div></div><br />\n<div class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"http://time.com/5163409/flu-pediatric-deaths/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"></div></aside>\n<p>Last week brought a dramatic uptick in pediatric flu deaths, with at least 22 more children dying from the virus between Feb. 4 and Feb. 10, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to the CDC</a>.</p>\n<p>That makes the week the deadliest yet for children this flu season, bringing the total number of pediatric deaths up to 84. Many of those children were otherwise healthy, according to the CDC.</p>\n<p>The somber statistic fulfills predictions from CDC Acting Director Dr. Anne Schuchat, who <a href=\"http://time.com/5141414/cdc-flu-report-flu-season-peak/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said on a call with reporters last week</a> that <a href=\"http://time.com/5130415/cdc-flu-update-high-hospitalization-rates/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">record-breaking hospitalization rates</a> at the time were likely an indicator of high death rates to come. &ldquo;The people who are likely to die may already be in the hospital,&rdquo; Schuchat said on the call.<br />\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"></div></div></p>\n\n<p>The CDC&#8217;s latest report did show, however, that about as many people saw doctors for flu-related symptoms last week as the week before, suggesting that <a href=\"http://time.com/5105929/why-is-the-flu-so-bad-2018/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this year&#8217;s brutal flu season</a> may be starting to wane &mdash; or at least level off. Nonetheless, the flu is still causing elevated levels of illness and hospitalization in states across the country, and may continue to do so for weeks to come.</p>\n<p>CDC officials have attributed this year&#8217;s serious influenza epidemic to the prevalence of H3N2, a viral strain that&#8217;s particularly severe and resistant to vaccination. <a href=\"http://time.com/5160213/flu-shot-effectiveness-2018/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In a report released Thursday</a>, the agency estimated that flu shots were only effective against H3N2 a quarter of the time this season, and only 36% effective overall.</p>\n<p>Still, unvaccinated people are urged to get the shot, as it&#8217;s more effective against non-H3N2 strains, which are beginning to circulate more widely at this point in the season. The vaccine may also reduce the severity of symptoms in those who do get sick. Children, especially, should get vaccinated, as the CDC estimates that the shot is up to 59% effective against H3N2 among kids between six months and eight years old.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/flu-shot-kids.jpeg?quality=85\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/flu-shot-kids.jpeg?quality=85\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Inside Perry Memorial Hospital As Senators Get Deal To Prop Up Obamacare</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Stop Blaming School Shootings on Mental Illness, Top Psychologist Warns</title>\n\t\t<link>http://time.com/5162927/mass-shootings-mental-health-apa/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 17:44:28 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jamie Ducharme]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[healthytime]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Mental Health/Psychology]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[onetime]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://time.com/?p=5162927</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The issue is more complicated than that]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module ad-300-250\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5162927\"></div></div><br />\n<div class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"http://time.com/5162927/mass-shootings-mental-health-apa/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"></div></aside>\n<p>American Psychological Association President Jessica Henderson Daniel has a message for those <a href=\"http://time.com/5160917/florida-school-shooting-donald-trump-mental-health/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blaming Wednesday&#8217;s deadly school shooting in Parkland, Fla., on mental illness</a>: Think twice.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While law enforcement is still piecing together the shooter&rsquo;s motives, some public figures and news reports are focusing on his mental health,&#8221; Daniel said in a statement Friday. &#8220;It is important to remember that <a href=\"https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/appi.books.9781615371099\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">only a very small percentage</a> of violent acts are committed by people who are diagnosed with, or in treatment for, mental illness.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many were quick to scrutinize the alleged shooter&#8217;s mental health in the wake of Wednesday&#8217;s tragedy, particularly in light of <a href=\"http://time.com/5159134/who-is-the-florida-shooter-parkland-nicolas-cruz/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reports that he may have sought treatment for mental health issues</a> in the past.

White matter deterioration was also linked with a decline in decision-making brain function among adults with early signs of memory loss, suggesting that regular exercise may slow cognitive decline and perhaps even dementia, say the study authors.</p>\n<p>The study, published in the <em><a href=\"https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad170415\"  target=\"_blank\">Journal of Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease</a></em>, is not the first to suggest that exercise may help keep the brain healthy in old age. But while previous research has asked adults to self-report their fitness levels, the new paper used an objective test for cardiorespiratory fitness&mdash;measuring people&rsquo;s VO2 max, a measure of how much oxygen their lungs can utilize during intense exercise.<br />\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"></div></div></p>\n<p>Researchers from the UT Southwestern Medical Center recruited 55 older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), meaning they were starting to show signs of memory problems, and 26 older adults with no signs of MCI. They used imaging techniques to study the white matter in participants&rsquo; brains, and measured their VO2 max during a treadmill exercise.</p>\n\n<p>They also performed a series of tests to evaluate people&#8217;s executive function, which involves mental skills used for everyday decision-making, problem-solving and planning and executing tasks. Executive function is different from memory, but often, both skill sets suffer in people with age-related cognitive problems.</p>\n<p>The researchers found that older adults with higher VO2 max scores&mdash;meaning they had better cardiorespiratory fitness&mdash;had less deterioration of the white-matter fibers in their brains. This was true in both groups of people in the study, with or without MCI, even after researchers controlled for factors such as age, sex and body mass index.</p>\n<p>White matter is comprised of millions of bundles of nerve fibers; it acts as the &ldquo;computer cables&rdquo; that connect various parts of the brain, says senior author Rong Zhang, neurology professor at UT Southwestern&#8217;s O&#8217;Donnell Brain Institute. &ldquo;If those cables get deteriorated, so do the pathways of communication,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p>The researchers also found that, in adults with MCI, white matter integrity was associated with executive function. In other words, the healthier the white-matter fibers, the better people&#8217;s scores were on tests for critical thinking and planning skills.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE</strong>: <a href=\"http://time.com/4619686/exercise-cognitive-decline/\" >Exercise Keeps the Brain Young, Study Says</a></p>\n<p>The findings strengthen the long-held hypothesis that maintaining or improving fitness levels in old age may protect the brain, the study authors write in their paper&mdash;even in people at high risk for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exciting, because the field right now is challenging,&rdquo; Zhang says. &ldquo;Even though we suspect it, there hasn&rsquo;t really been any conclusive evidence that exercise can have an impact on the development of dementia.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Last year, the <a href=\"http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=24782\"  target=\"_blank\">National Academies of Sciences</a> reported that, despite advances in understanding dementia, the evidence on treatment and prevention interventions &ldquo;remains relatively limited and has significant shortcomings.&rdquo; The idea that increased physical activity may delay or slow age-related cognitive decline is supported by &ldquo;encouraging but inconclusive evidence,&rdquo; the report concluded.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE</strong>: <a href=\"http://time.com/4841790/exercise-brain/\" >What Type of Exercise Is Best for the Brain?</a></p>\n<p>Many experts believe that maintaining physical fitness can help keep blood flowing normally to brain tissue, which can reduce the risk of damage or deterioration. Animal and human studies have also shown that aerobic exercise stimulates the release of growth hormones that may also improve brain function. In 2013, Zhang&rsquo;s team found that messages are more efficiently relayed between brain cells in older adults who exercise, compared to those who are sedentary.</p>\n<p>Zhang says that the new study was too small to inform any definite conclusions, and that it does not answer questions about how much or what types of exercise might be best for older adults. Because it was observational, it was only able to show an association between fitness levels, white matter integrity and executive function&mdash;not a cause-and-effect relationship.</p>\n<p>For those reasons, his team is now involved in an ongoing <a href=\"http://www.rradtrial.org/\"  target=\"_blank\">five-year trial</a> involving more than 600 older adults at high risk for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease due to family history and other factors. The research, which is taking place at six medical schools around the country, aims to determine whether specific exercise routines&mdash;paired with medications to lower blood pressure and cholesterol&mdash;can reduce the risk of dementia.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It makes sense that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s good for the heart is good for the brain,&rdquo; says Zhang. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we need sophisticated science to make that point, but we do need more studies to make evidence-based recommendations about what strategies work best. And in a couple of years, I&rsquo;m positive, we should have that sort of evidence.&rdquo;</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/time-magazine-exercise-fitness-health-bethan-mooney-23.jpg?quality=85\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/time-magazine-exercise-fitness-health-bethan-mooney-23.jpg?quality=85\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">time-magazine-exercise-fitness-health-bethan-mooney-23</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>No, the Flu Shot Will Not Make You Spread the Flu</title>\n\t\t<link>http://time.com/5162501/are-you-contagious-after-a-flu-shot/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 15:41:02 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Seth Borenstein / AP]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[APH]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[flu]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[healthytime]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[onetime]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://time.com/?p=5162501</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[It also doesn't weaken your immune system]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5162501\"></div></div><br />\n<div class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"http://time.com/5162501/are-you-contagious-after-a-flu-shot/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"></div></aside>\n<p>(WASHINGTON) &mdash; Getting the flu shot won&#8217;t make you spread the disease more, doesn&#8217;t weaken your immune system but it does offer some protection from getting infected, despite misleading claims on social media.</p>\n<p>A post on a site called thewilddoc claimed that being vaccinated does more harm than good, citing a January peer-reviewed study. But one of the main authors of that study called the post &#8220;untrue&#8221; and &#8220;misleading,&#8221; not accurately interpreting the study.</p>\n<p>In January, Dr. Donald Milton and a team of researchers at the University of Maryland published a<a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/01/17/1716561115.full\"  target=\"_blank\"> study</a> in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences about how the influenza virus spreads not just in coughs, but also in the breath of 142 flu-struck people. Of those people with flu, only 22 percent had gotten vaccinated that year, but among those who had been vaccinated they shed six times more tiny aerosols of the flu.<br />\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"></div></div></p>\n<p>The social media post than took that study and made four claims, all of which Milton said were untrue or misleading.</p>\n<p>The biggest claim from the posting &mdash; &#8220;individuals who receive the flu vaccine are placing others around them at greater risk than the unvaccinated&#8221; &mdash; is wrong, according to Milton, who has a medical degree and doctorate in public health. &#8220;Unvaccinated people are more likely to get the flu and transmit it to other people because they shed lots of virus into the nasal secretions into the air,&#8221; he wrote in an email.</p>\n<p>Milton said people who are sick with flu shed about 40,000 viruses or so every half hour. While sick people vaccinated shed six times more aerosols than the sick who weren&#8217;t vaccinated, that&#8217;s not the proper way to look at it, Milton said. People who are not sick because they got vaccinated don&#8217;t shed and spread flu, which is a more meaningful comparison, he said.</p>\n<p>Further, Milton said the part about more virus shed by those vaccinated &#8220;is based on only 11 cases&#8221; so that makes it preliminary and needs to be confirmed, something that prominent flu researcher Peter Palese, chairman of microbiology at the Mt. Sinai Medical School in New York City, agreed with. Palese edited the Milton study for the scientific journal.</p>\n<p>The posting also claimed Milton&#8217;s study shows that &#8220;the vaccine doesn&#8217;t protect one from infection.&#8221; Milton, in an email, called this wrong and said his study didn&#8217;t examine vaccine effectiveness. His research just looked at sick people, most of whom had not gotten shots, he said.</p>\n<p>The post claimed that Milton&#8217;s study showed that people who had been vaccinated are spreading more virus simply by breathing. Milton called that misleading because all flu-struck people spread the disease simply by breathing, even more if they cough.</p>\n<p>And the post also claimed that Milton&#8217;s study shows that getting vaccinated weakened immune systems. Milton said that people who are vaccinated are not more likely to get sick than others, and even when the vaccine didn&#8217;t protect patients from illness, it did not affect the immune system.</p>\n<p>Palese said the social media post is a classic example of &#8220;shoddy scholarship and should best be ignored.&#8221;</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/flu-shot-vaccine-social-media-post-untrue.jpg?quality=85\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/flu-shot-vaccine-social-media-post-untrue.jpg?quality=85\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">Flu clinic</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>&#8216;Not a Magic Potion.&#8217; Flu Death Puts Antiviral Drugs in the Spotlight</title>\n\t\t<link>http://time.com/5160847/flu-death-antiviral-drugs/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 14:56:28 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jamie Stengle / AP]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[APH]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[healthytime]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[medicine]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[onetime]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://time.com/?p=5160847</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[DALLAS (AP) &#8212; A Texas elementary school teacher who died almost a week after getting sick from the flu became a talking point online after her husband said she didn&#8217;t immediately fill her prescription for an antiviral drug after deeming the $116 insurance co-pay too high.

The mother of two went to work in nearby Weatherford on Jan. 30 but by evening had a fever.</p>\n<p>She went to the doctor on Jan. 31. Frank Holland said a rapid flu test was positive for influenza B.

There are people that are going to do very poorly, regardless of getting Tamiflu or not. And then there&#8217;s kind of the middle segment of the population where Tamiflu really may push them to the right outcome,&#8221; said Dr. Luis Ostrosky, an infectious disease expert with McGovern Medical School at UTHealth and Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center in Houston.</p>\n<p>Dr. Trish Perl, chief of infectious diseases at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said that &#8220;in some cases it may be useful&#8221; to give patients an antiviral even after the 48-hour onset.</p>\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the flu shot is the best way to prevent seasonal flu.

You can also add other spices or fruits such as smashed banana or diced apple.</p>\n<p>When serving this porridge, it&rsquo;s important to have an extra pot of steaming hot milk on the side, ready to pour over. I think serving with hot milk is probably the most important rule in porridge making as it allows all the flavours to come together in perfect balance.<br />\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"></div></div></p>\n<p>You can serve your porridge with your choice of milk, but I love mine made with almond milk. I normally make a double batch of this recipe so I can just reheat it the next morning for breakfast. This recipe is from my cookbook <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/book/id1029254909\"  target=\"_blank\">Purely Delicious.</a></p>\n<p><strong>WHAT&#8217;S GREAT ABOUT IT</strong></p>\n<p>This is a protein packed power breakfast that&#8217;ll boost your energy and sustain you all morning. According to studies, the beta-glucan fiber found in oats can help <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24024772\"  target=\"_blank\">regulate your appetite</a> as well as help to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21631511\"  target=\"_blank\">lower cholesterol. </a></p>\n<p>When cooking steel cut oats, I prefer to soak it first in plenty of water overnight before cooking. This simple process reduces the cooking time and makes it creamier. A light sprinkling of ground flaxseeds contains omega-3s and a drizzle of Manuka honey <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3758027/\"  target=\"_blank\">contains antioxidants.</a></p>\n<p>Serves 4</p>\n<p><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>2/3 cup (120g / 4 1/4 oz) steel cut oats</li>\n<li>4 cups (1 liter / 2 pints) water</li>\n<li>2 generous tablespoons roasted almond butter</li>\n<li>1 teaspoons ground cinnamon or 2 cinnamon sticks</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>\n<li>2 teaspoons vanilla bean extract</li>\n<li>Pinch of sea salt</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon ground flaxseed, LSA or walnuts</li>\n<li>Manuka honey or raw honey</li>\n<li>Hot almond milk to serve</li>\n<li>Smashed banana to serve (optional)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>DIRECTIONS</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Combine steel-cut oats, water, cinnamon, ginger and vanilla into a heavy saucepan</li>\n<li>Heat gently and bring to a boil then reduce the heat, partially cover and simmer for 20 &#8211; 25 minutes or until the porridge is thick and creamy. You will need to stir the porridge occasionally during this time to prevent sticking and you may need to add an extra cup of water if required. Your porridge should be silky and creamy, not too thick</li>\n<li>Mix in your almond butter until combined and season with a little sea salt to taste</li>\n<li>Serve porridge in bowls, topped with flaxseed and a drizzle of honey</li>\n<li>Pour over extra hot almond milk and enjoy</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>NOTES + INSPIRATION: </strong>Add other spices such as star anise when cooking. Try folding smashed banana through your porridge for an instant banana bread porridge.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve made the recipe above using un-soaked steel-cut oats, which is the reason for the slightly longer cooking time and amount of water used in this recipe. If using soaked oats, rinse well and combine into a heavy based pot with slightly less water. Cook, stirring occasionally for 15 minutes or until oats are tender, add more water if required. Stir in the almond butter just before serving.</p>\n<p><em>Teresa Cutter, founder of </em><a href=\"https://www.thehealthychef.com/about/\"  target=\"_blank\"><em>The Healthy Chef</em></a><em>, is an author, nutritionist and classically trained chef.

In the wake of the Florida shooting, for example, sources ranging from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sandyhook/status/960513550996443136\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gun control organizations</a> to <a href=\"http://time.com/5159973/donald-trump-tweets-florida-school-shooting-suspect/?xid=homepage\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">President Donald Trump</a> emphasized the need to speak up about potentially dangerous behavior.<br />\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"></div></div></p>\n<p>How can parents best prepare their kids?</p>\n<p>TIME spoke with Peter Langman, a Pennsylvania-based clinical psychologist and the author of <em>Why Kids Kill: Inside the Minds of School Shooters</em> and <em>School Shooters </em>and Jeff Temple, a professor and psychologist in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Texas Medical Branch. Here&#8217;s what they had to say about talking to your kids about preventing mass violence.</p>\n<h2>Help them understand the warning signs</h2>\n<p>The most basic <a href=\"https://schoolshooters.info/prevention\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">warning sign</a> of violence is a concept called &#8220;leakage,&#8221; Langman says.</p>\n<p>&#8220;People leak their intentions,&#8221; Langman explains. &#8220;Sometimes they just brag about what they&#8217;re going to do. They&#8217;ll say, right out, &#8216;I&#8217;m going to bring a gun to school and kill people.&#8217; Other times, it&#8217;s more subtle. They might warn some of their friends not to be in school on a certain day, or [say], &#8216;Don&#8217;t go in the cafeteria at lunch on Monday.'&#8221;</p>\n<p>Langman says it&#8217;s important for kids to take this kind of speech or behavior seriously. They should feel comfortable reporting it to an adult, even if they think the student is joking, and let authority figures determine if it&#8217;s actually a cause for concern. Schools can also do their part by setting up easy-to-use, anonymous reporting channels, such as hotlines, websites or letter boxes, he says.</p>\n<p>Schools and parents must also teach kids that reporting concerning behavior isn&#8217;t the same thing as snitching on a friend, Langman says.</p>\n<p>Tell kids, &#8220;&#8216;You might tattletale on your brother or sister just to get them in trouble. But the reason you report a safety concern is to keep people safe and alive,'&#8221; Langman says. &#8220;If you can help kids think through the possible consequences, they can make a better decision.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Encourage them to help their classmates</h2>\n<p>Oftentimes, worrisome behavior &mdash; acting withdrawn or seriously depressed, for example &mdash; isn&#8217;t as black and white as leakage. In these cases, it can be helpful to frame the issue as coming to the aid of a classmate who may be struggling, rather than turning in peers because they might be dangerous, Temple says.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The conversation is better in terms of looking out for your fellow classmates and students, identifying who they are and doing whatever you can to get them help, as opposed to trying to prevent them from being violent, because most will not,&#8221; Temple says. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s okay, if you&#8217;re a kid, to go to a teacher and say, &#8216;Hey, I&#8217;m worried about John.'&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t stigmatize mental illnesses</h2>\n<p>Both experts say the &#8220;see something, say something&#8221; mentality can be a slippery slope. On a macro level, it can make mental health conditions an oversimplified scapegoat for a complex issue. On a micro level, it can lead kids to unfairly single out classmates who are just a little different. Parents and educators should help children understand that nuance, Langman says.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Someone who&#8217;s a bit odd is not a danger. Someone who&#8217;s a bit odd and is talking about bringing a gun to school is a potential danger,&#8221; Langman says. &#8220;It&#8217;s not about someone&#8217;s social skills or what they look like or if they have poor grooming or wear black trench coats. What you&#8217;re really looking for is the leakage,&#8221; or other concerning behaviors.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t shy away from tough conversations</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s never easy to speak to your children about violence, but doing so may help them in the long run, Langman says. &#8220;Giving them something to do might actually lessen their anxiety,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Scary as it can be to talk about these things, at least they know what they&#8217;re supposed to do and that the adults are doing what they can.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Temple adds that an open and honest dialogue is important, but stresses the need to keep things in perspective. &#8220;Be honest with them,&#8221; Temple says. &#8220;Tell them that bad things do happen, but also reassure them that it&#8217;s rare and that there are people that are there to keep them safe.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>For more information, refer to the <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/aftermath.aspx\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">American Psychological Association&#8217;s guidelines</a> for helping kids deal with distress after tragedy.</em></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/parkland-florida-shooting-kids.jpg?quality=85\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/parkland-florida-shooting-kids.jpg?quality=85\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">school-shooting-florida</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>How to Make Friends as an Adult \u2014 and Why It&#8217;s Important</title>\n\t\t<link>http://time.com/5159867/adult-friendships-loneliness/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 19:56:27 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Mandy Oaklander]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[healthytime]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[relationships]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://time.com/?p=5159867</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[ It will be worth it for your health and happiness]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5159867\"></div></div><br />\n<div class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"http://time.com/5159867/adult-friendships-loneliness/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"></div></aside>\n<p>Anyone who&#8217;s ever made room for a big milestone of adult life&#8211;a job, a marriage, a move&#8211;has likely shoved a friendship to the side. After all, there is no contract locking us to the other person, as in marriage, and there are no blood bonds, as in family. Friendships are flexible. &#8220;We choose our friends, and our friends choose us,&#8221; says William K. Rawlins, Stocker Professor of Communication Studies at Ohio University. &#8220;That&#8217;s a really distinctive attribute of friendships.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But modern life can become so busy that people forget to keep choosing each other. That&#8217;s when friendships fade, and there&#8217;s reason to believe it&#8217;s happening more than ever. Loneliness is on the rise, and feeling lonely has been found to increase a person&#8217;s risk of dying early by 26%&#8211;and to be even worse for the body than obesity and air pollution. Loneliness wreaks health havoc in many ways, particularly because it removes the safety net of social support. &#8220;When we perceive our world as threatening, that can be associated with an increase in heart rate and blood pressure,&#8221; says Julianne Holt-Lunstad, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Brigham Young University and author of the recent study linking loneliness to mortality. Over time, she says, these effects can lead to hypertension, which increases risk for cardiovascular disease.<br />\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"></div></div></p>\n<p>The antidote is simple: friendship. It helps protect the brain and body from stress, anxiety and depression. &#8220;Being around trusted others, in essence, signals safety and security,&#8221; says Holt-Lunstad. A study last year found that friendships are especially beneficial later in life. Having supportive friends in old age was a stronger predictor of well-being than family ties&#8211;suggesting that the friends you pick may be at least as important as the family you&#8217;re born into.</p>\n<p>Easy as the fix may sound, it can be difficult to keep and make friends as an adult. But research suggests that you only need between four and five close pals. If you&#8217;ve ever had a good one, you know what you&#8217;re looking for. &#8220;The expectations of friends, once you have a mature understanding of friendship, don&#8217;t really change across the life course,&#8221; Rawlins says. &#8220;People want their close friends to be someone they can talk to, someone they can depend upon and someone they enjoy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re trying to replenish a dried-up friendship pool, start by looking inward. Think back to how you met some of your very favorite friends. Volunteering on a political campaign or in a favorite spin class? Playing in a band? &#8220;Friendships are always about something,&#8221; says Rawlins. Common passions help people bond at a personal level, and they bridge people of different ages and life experiences.</p>\n<p>Whatever you&#8217;re into, someone else is too. Let your passion guide you toward people. Volunteer, for example, take a new course or join a committee at your local religious center. If you like yoga, start going to classes regularly. Fellow dog lovers tend to congregate at dog runs. Using apps and social media&#8211;like <a href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/facebook/\"  target=\"_blank\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> to find a local book club&#8211;is also a good way to find simpatico folks.</p>\n<p>Once you meet a potential future friend, then comes the scary part: inviting them to do something. &#8220;You do have to put yourself out there,&#8221; says Janice McCabe, associate professor of sociology at Dartmouth College and a friendship researcher. &#8220;There&#8217;s a chance that the person will say no. But there&#8217;s also the chance they&#8217;ll say yes, and something really great could happen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The process takes time, and you may experience false starts. Not everyone will want to put in the effort necessary to be a good friend.</p>\n<p>Which is reason enough to nurture the friendships you already have&#8211;even those than span many miles. Start by scheduling a weekly phone call. &#8220;It seems kind of funny to do that, because we often think about scheduling as tasks or work,&#8221; says McCabe. &#8220;But it&#8217;s easy, especially as an adult, to lose track of making time for a phone call.&#8221; When a friend reaches out to you, don&#8217;t forget to tell them how much it means to you.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s never too late to start being a better pal. The work you put into friendships&#8211;both new and old&#8211;will be well worth it for your health and happiness.</p>\n<br><em>This appears in the February 26, 2018 issue of TIME.</em>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/old-friends-longevity-pete-ryan.jpg?quality=85\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/old-friends-longevity-pete-ryan.jpg?quality=85\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">old-friends-longevity-pete-ryan</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>5 Places Where People Live the Longest and Healthiest Lives</title>\n\t\t<link>http://time.com/5160475/blue-zones-healthy-long-lives/</link>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 19:05:48 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jamie Ducharme]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Aging]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Diet/Nutrition]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[healthytime]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Longevity]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[onetime]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://time.com/?p=5160475</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[These areas are known as Blue Zones]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5160475\"></div></div><br />\n<div class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"http://time.com/5160475/blue-zones-healthy-long-lives/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"></div></aside>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 6\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Global life expectancy averages out to 71.4 years. That means, of course, that some parts of the world see much shorter life spans, while others <a href=\"http://time.com/5159852/the-surprising-secrets-to-living-longer-and-better/\" >enjoy far greater longevity</a>.</p>\n<p>Five places, in particular, fall into the latter category. They&rsquo;re known as Blue Zones&mdash;named for the blue circles researchers drew to identify the first one on a map&mdash;and they&rsquo;re home to some of the oldest and healthiest people in the world. Dan Buettner, author of The Blue Zones and The Blue Zones Solution, told TIME why residents of these places live so long&mdash;and how you can steal their habits.<br />\n<div class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"><div id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"></div></div></p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 6\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h2>Sardinia, Italy</h2>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 6\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>A largely plant-based diet, daily physical activity and familial closeness have given this Blue Zone the highest concentration of male centenarians in the world. (Sheep herders, who tend to walk at least five miles a day, and men with daughters, who may get especially tender care as they age, live even longer than most in this area.) It also doesn&rsquo;t hurt that the M26 marker, a genetic variant linked to extreme longevity, has been passed down through generations in this secluded community.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Read more: </strong></em><em><a href=\"http://time.com/5159892/how-to-become-less-afraid-of-death/\" >How to Become Less Afraid of Death</a></em></p>\n<h2>Okinawa, Japan</h2>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 6\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Many Blue Zones emphasize family and community, but bonding reaches its peak in this Japanese culture. Okinawans are supported by their moai, a small but tight-knit social circle meant to be there through all of life&rsquo;s ups and downs, which provides social support strong enough to dull mental stressors and reinforce shared healthy behaviors. The result? A culture that boasts the longest-living women in the world, with many surpassing 100.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Nicoya, Costa Rica</h2>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 6\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Most Blue Zone residents avoid processed food, but Nicoyans take it to another level. The Costa Rican people traditionally get the majority of their caloric intake from beans, squash and corn, plus tropical fruits. This plant-forward, nutrient-dense diet&mdash; and plenty of time outdoors&mdash;makes for strong, well-nourished bodies. Meanwhile, a plan de vida, or guiding life purpose, helps Nicoyans stay mentally and spiritually fulfilled to age 90 and beyond.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Read more: </strong></em><em><a href=\"http://time.com/5159879/is-an-anti-aging-pill-on-the-horizon/\" >Is an Anti-Aging Pill on the Horizon?</a></em></p>\n<h2>Loma Linda, Calif., U.S.A.</h2>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 6\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The U.S.&rsquo;s only Blue Zone is a haven for the Seventh-day Adventist Church, a Protestant denomination. A shared set of principles, emphasis on community and adherence to the Sabbath&mdash;a day of rest, reflection and recharging&mdash; help Loma Linda Adventists live 10 years longer than their fellow Americans. Many avoid meat and eat plenty of plants, whole grains and nuts.</p>\n<h2>Ikaria, Greece</h2>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 6\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>A fierce sense of island pride keeps Ikarians invested in their community. That, combined with late bedtimes offset by daily naps and a strict adherence to the Mediterranean diet&mdash;eating lots of fruits, vegetables, beans, whole grains, potatoes and olive oil&mdash;propels 1 in 3 Ikarians to live into their 90s, often free of dementia and chronic disease.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\n\t\t<media:thumbnail url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/blue-zones.jpg?quality=85\" />\n\t\t<media:content url=\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/blue-zones.jpg?quality=85\" medium=\"image\">\n\t\t\t<media:title type=\"html\">blue-zones</media:title>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n",
