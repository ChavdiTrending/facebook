Dean and Davina Took Shady to a Whole New Level on MAFS Tonight</title>\n <link>https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/Dean-Davina-Cheating-MAFS-44594661</link>\n <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/Dean-Davina-Cheating-MAFS-44594661&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;160&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; src=&quot;https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/JiMGgxYsyFoi0-OV3IvzYoXo9lM/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/02/18/421/n/4852708/c595fa765a89420b57a428.11222928_edit_img_image_3040679_1518941451.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re going to need a lie-down. Tonight&#039;s episode of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.com.au/tag/Married-at-First-Sight&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Married at First Sight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was beyond dramatic - easily the most of any of the seasons so far. Before we explain why it was such a whopper, let us quickly recap for you:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The moment contestants Davina and Dean set eyes on each other, they felt an instant attraction. Pretty awkward considering they were both married to other people in the experiment. It didn&#039;t take long for both of them to toy with the idea of leaving their respective partners, Ryan and Tracey, to be with each other instead. They acted on their attraction quickly, and met up for secret drinks while their partners were completely unaware. There was plenty of canoodling and the conversation was inappropriate to say the least. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the dinner party last week, things got even more intense: Davina and Dean were about as close as you can get to kissing without actually kissing, and they both promised to leave their partners come Sunday&#039;s commitment ceremony. Where we left them on Wednesday night&#039;s episode, it was all pretty concrete: Dean and Davina would opt to leave their respective marriages and instead give it a go together. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And so, we arrive at the commitment ceremony tonight - and let us tell you, the nerves are pretty real. Davina looks like she&#039;s desperate for it to be all over so she can be with Dean, and writes &quot;Leave&quot; on the card that she&#039;ll have to present to Ryan. Davina has her sights set on Dean and she&#039;s 100 percent committed to doing whatever it takes to be with him.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dean, on the other hand, has had a change of heart. Something at the dinner party triggered a change of heart - he went home with Tracey, they slept together and, the next morning, he realised he&#039;d maybe cast Tracey aside too quickly. He makes it clear he&#039;s rethinking his decision to leave her for Davina and . . . well, sh*t. That&#039;s super awkward.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Watching the episode and knowing that Davina is committed to ditching Ryan for Dean, but that Dean has changed his mind, is kind of excruciating. Almost as excruciating as it&#039;s been watching Tracey wax lyrical about how Dean is a changed man and making a real effort to save their relationship all week.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We arrive at the point we&#039;ve all been waiting for: it&#039;s time for Dean to tell the group if he&#039;s staying or leaving Tracey.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He launches straight in and tells everyone that something shifted between him and Tracey and that they&#039;re in a great place. He then says that he has to come clean about something to Tracey, and proceeds to tell her most of what had happened between him and Davina, while strongly steering the conversation in his favour (she made the move on me, etc.).\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It takes all of three seconds for Davina to pipe up and tell everyone that Dean is lying and that he&#039;d promised her they would leave their partners so they could be together. She details some of the things he told her, including that he&#039;s more attracted to her than Tracey and that there was nothing romantic between Dean and Tracey.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It was, as seems to be the theme of the show right now, excruciating - and the rest of the couples cannot believe what they are hearing. Nassar in particular is incensed by Dean&#039;s double-crossing behaviour, and tells Davina and Tracey that he&#039;s played both of them. There&#039;s a whole lot of outrage in the room and, annoyingly, most of it is directed at Dean, even though Davina is equally responsible for this sh*tshow.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s easily the most dramatically confrontational scene we&#039;ve seen in five seasons of the show and wow, the tension in that room was palpable through the TV.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In light of the revelation, Tracey is given extra time to think about whether she wants to stay with Dean or not. They talk it out, he lies some more, but she decides to give it one more shot. She receives a lot of judgement when the group hears her decision but she stands firm: she wants to give Dean another chance and if it blows up in her face, so be it. She&#039;s a strong woman and we admire her stoicism in the face of what must have been truly hurtful and embarrassing.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As for Davina? She&#039;s super upset and feels betrayed - and we&#039;re sure there&#039;s a sting of embarrassment in their too, that she was rejected so publicly by a guy she seemed to be falling for pretty intensely. Davina wrote &quot;Leave&quot; on her card for Ryan while he, none the wiser, had written &quot;Stay.&quot; As we know, if the couples have different decisions at the commitment ceremonies, they have to stay for another week - so Ryan is stuck with Davina for another seven days whether he likes it or not.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And so we have another week of drama ahead. It&#039;ll be interesting to see what relationship, if any, remains between Davina and Dean - and how their betrayed partners Tracey and Ryan choose to move forward. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/groups/747580672091561/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Need to talk it out?

Over the years, the cooking show has evolved to become so much more than, well, just a cooking show - the majority of the action, as history has indicated, takes place with the contestants. Dinner table drama, lovers&#039; quarrels in the kitchen, preferences over the degree to which a steak should be cooked . . . It goes on. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Casting then, is pretty important when it comes to a show like &lt;strong&gt;MKR&lt;/strong&gt;. As the 2018 season plays out, get to know all the contestants below.

No, not the scene where Christian gives us &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/Jamie-Dornan-Song-Fifty-Shades-Freed-Soundtrack-44484795&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a beautiful rendition of &quot;Maybe I&#039;m Amazed&quot;&lt;/a&gt; on the piano (but, I mean, that too). Rather, I&#039;m talking about the scene in &lt;strong&gt;Fifty Shades Freed &lt;/strong&gt;that left many of us confused: when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/What-Does-Jack-Do-Fifty-Shades-Freed-44526353&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jack Hyde kidnaps Mia Grey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jack is released from prison on bail and kidnaps Mia not too long after. While everyone else in the family has tight-knit security, Mia has a habit of ditching her bodyguard. This may be the reason he goes for her over anyone else, holding her at gunpoint for a $5 million ransom.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He blackmails Elizabeth Morgan, his former associate from Seattle Independent Press, into being his accomplice. After threatening her with a videotape of the two of them having sex (which we later learn is something he&#039;s done in the past), Liz is forced to go along with his plans. She drives Ana to the scene and, as confirmed in the book, she was also the driver following Ana and Christian in the beginning of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This makes a lot of sense of her being all buddy-buddy with Ana at SIP throughout the course of the movie. She even consoled her after the initial incident with Hyde, asking her how she felt about it, all in an attempt to gain her trust and retrieve information she could report back to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anastasia drops everything to rescue her sister-in-law, following careful instructions to do so alone, which leave her security guard and husband totally baffled. She gives Liz a random phone, outsmarting the two of them and sneaking her real phone into the bag of cash so Christian can track it and find her. In the meantime, she manages to grab ahold of a gun and shoot Hyde in the leg, saving herself and Mia. Police arrive on scene, landing Hyde behind bars once again along with his accomplice, Liz.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ana has some serious injuries afterward, landing her in the hospital for some time, but in the end, she and the baby are safe and sound and Mia leaves the scene unharmed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;related-stories&quot;&gt;Related&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/Fifty-Shades-Freed-Soundtrack-44488727&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;You Can Already Listen to 4 Songs From the Steamy Fifty Shades Freed Soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Initially, we&#039;re led to believe that this whole plot was Hyde seeking revenge against Christian for getting him fired from SIP, but in the end, we realise that couldn&#039;t be further from the truth. We learn from a dated photo that Jack and Christian were raised in the same foster home in Detroit, before Christian was adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Grey. Jack also sent him threatening notes, like the one that read &quot;you owe me a life,&quot; which refer to Christian being adopted instead of him. Christian was handed a life of wealth, advantages, and opportunities that Hyde feels he should have gotten instead, while in reality he stayed in the system and ended up with nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ana reminds a struggling Christian that even though he was granted an amazing life, he was the one who made the most of it and he deserves everything that he has.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com.au/latest/Fifty Shades Freed\">Fifty Shades Freed</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com.au/latest/Fifty Shades of Grey\">Fifty Shades of Grey</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com.au/latest/Movies\">Movies</category>\n <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 18:05:11 +1100</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Alex Maxx</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">44577680</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>Why Does Jack Kidnap Mia in Fifty Shades Freed?</search_title>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title>It Took About 5 Seconds For People to Wonder If Jennifer and Brad Will Get Back Together</title>\n <link>https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/Jennifer-Aniston-Get-Back-Together-Brad-Pitt-44590990</link>\n <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/Jennifer-Aniston-Get-Back-Together-Brad-Pitt-44590990&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;120&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; src=&quot;https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/LWIoq3YBqGsLXPEII5ALMbmfDSY/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/02/15/053/n/1922398/11ba78535a862328a7dac0.39878269_edit_img_cover_file_44590255_1518739210.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ink was barely dry on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/Jennifer-Aniston-Justin-Theroux-Separating-44590155&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux&#039;s separation announcement&lt;/a&gt; before people on Twitter began sharing their furious hopes that the actress will rekindle her relationship with ex-husband &lt;a class=&quot;sugar-inline-link&quot; title=&quot;Latest photos and news for Brad Pitt&quot; href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/Brad-Pitt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brad Pitt&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/Jennifer-Aniston-Brad-Pitt-Wedding-Facts-43504557&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brad and Jen were famously married&lt;/a&gt; in July 2000 and, even more famously, ended their marriage five years later &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/Brad-Pitt-Talking-Jennifer-Aniston-About-Divorce-2017-43251110&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;amid rumours of Brad&#039;s infidelity with Angelina Jolie&lt;/a&gt;.

But that high-profile slaying is merely a jumping-off point to examine the life of Andrew Cunanan, the man who went on a murder spree that left four people dead before culminating in the famous fashion designer&#039;s murder.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The book on which the season is based is called &lt;strong&gt;Vulgar Favors: Andrew Cunanan, Gianni Versace, and the Largest Failed Manhunt in U.S. History&lt;/strong&gt; because Cunanan evaded law enforcement for months as he traversed the country, killing men for largely unknown reasons. But what happened to him after Versace&#039;s death?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The show hasn&#039;t gotten to this point yet; it&#039;s working its way backward, so the farthest forward we&#039;ve gotten in time is Cunanan hiding out in Miami, almost being caught at a sandwich shop after a clerk recognizes him as Versace&#039;s killer from the news reports. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cunanan managed to stay out of sight in Miami for over a week, though &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1997/09/cunanan199709&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;calls were coming in from people all over the country&lt;/a&gt; claiming they had spotted Cunanan, according to &lt;strong&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/strong&gt;. But the killer was actually holed up in an unoccupied houseboat in Miami, less than three miles from Versace&#039;s mansion. Cunanan&#039;s body was discovered when a caretaker heard a shot and went to investigate. Police engaged in a 12-hour siege on the houseboat, getting SWAT in place and lobbing tear gas canisters. But eventually they found Cunanan&#039;s body in a second-floor bedroom; he had shot himself in the mouth with the same gun that he used to kill David Madson, William Reese and Versace.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After the suicide, the &lt;strong&gt;New York Times&lt;/strong&gt; spoke with some local Miami residents and tourists, all of whom were full of relief that the killer was no longer on the loose. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;The world is a safer place without someone like Andrew Cunanan in it, killing people. Obviously, it was getting easier and easier for him to kill,&quot; Phyllis Brown &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/25/us/suspect-s-suicide-brings-relief-and-normality.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;told the paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And two local nurses, Grisel Gigato and George Sijtsema, said that they thought he got off easy with being able to commit suicide.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was hoping he would get caught,&quot; said Gigato. &quot;The fact that he killed himself, he got away with it easy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sijtsema added, &quot;I never thought he would make it out alive, but I would have rather have seen him suffer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com.au/latest/The Assassination of Gianni Versace\">The Assassination of Gianni Versace</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com.au/latest/True Stories\">True Stories</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com.au/latest/American Crime Story\">American Crime Story</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com.au/latest/TV\">TV</category>\n <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 11:05:02 +1100</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Andrea Reiher</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">44577681</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>Is Andrew Cunanan Still Alive?</search_title>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title>21 Insane Things That I Still Can&#039;t Believe Actually Happen in Fifty Shades Freed</title>\n <link>https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/Best-Moments-Fifty-Shades-Freed-44573374</link>\n <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/Best-Moments-Fifty-Shades-Freed-44573374&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;160&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; src=&quot;https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/T6hgw7LdBuH2dG0Yh9SUob_Vodg/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/02/09/180/n/1922283/31769a815a7e64d78f8ba1.06391566_edit_img_image_17268548_1518232555.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you&#039;re a huge Fifty Shades fan, you have to admit that the first two film adaptations - &lt;strong&gt;Fifty Shades of Grey&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Fifty Shades Darker&lt;/strong&gt; - are incredible in that &quot;so bad, they&#039;re good&quot; kind of way. The cheesy dialogue, nonsensical storylines, and watered-down BDSM sex scenes are all part of the fun, right? The third and final film in the trilogy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/tag/Fifty-Shades-Freed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fifty Shades Freed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is no different.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/Fifty-Shades-Freed-Soundtrack-44488727&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the soundtrack is complete and utter fire&lt;/a&gt;, the last act of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele&#039;s relationship &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/What-Happens-Fifty-Shades-Freed-42247961&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;includes some truly questionable moments&lt;/a&gt;. There&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/Jamie-Dornan-Really-Singing-Fifty-Shades-Freed-44563027&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an unexpected and fairly awkward piano ballad&lt;/a&gt;! There&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/What-Does-Jack-Do-Fifty-Shades-Freed-44526353&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a thinly drawn kidnapping plot&lt;/a&gt;! There&#039;s . . . Rita Ora! It&#039;s &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; (and yet somehow it&#039;s still not enough). &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After watching &lt;strong&gt;Fifty Shades Freed&lt;/strong&gt; in a cinema full of people openly - and affectionately, for the most part - roaring with laughter at all the silly things that happen, I&#039;m still coming down from the high of being able to witness the final instalment of such a beautiful disaster of a movie franchise. Join me as I break down the best moments in the climax (heh) of author E.L. James&#039;s masterpiece. (Note: &lt;em&gt;big spoilers for &lt;strong&gt;Fifty Shades Freed&lt;/strong&gt; below!&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;related-stories&quot;&gt;Related&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/Fifty-Shades-Freed-Photos-44559546&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;These Photos From Fifty Shades Freed Are More Romantic Than Any Valentine&#039;s Day Card&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The boob fight:&lt;/strong&gt; The movie starts with Christian and Anastasia&#039;s lavish &lt;a class=&quot;sugar-inline-link&quot; title=&quot;Latest photos and news for wedding&quot; href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/Wedding&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wedding&lt;/a&gt; and quickly segues into their equally lavish Parisian honeymoon. They end up heading to the South of France, where Christian whisks his new bride to a topless beach, which totally checks out, given all the sexy stuff they get up to in their private life. But then . . . he becomes furious . . . that Ana . . . takes her top off? At a &lt;em&gt;topless beach&lt;/em&gt;? I totally get why - he&#039;s psychotically possessive and needs decades of therapy - but it&#039;s still ridiculous. Spoiler alert: Anastasia still takes her top off. (&quot;There are boobs in Boobland.&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Their magic plane:&lt;/strong&gt; Christian and Ana take a tiny private jet from Seattle to Paris for their honeymoon, which obviously isn&#039;t possible unless you&#039;re riding in that car Elon Musk shot into space. What kind of secret, advanced flight technology is Grey Enterprises hiding?!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Jack Hyde problem:&lt;/strong&gt; Remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Who-Jack-Hyde-Fifty-Shades-Darker-43143802&quot; &gt;Jack Hyde&lt;/a&gt;? Anastasia&#039;s old boss at Seattle Independent Publishing who sexually assaulted her and was then fired by Christian? Well, he&#039;s made it his life&#039;s mission to take down the Greys. We discover that while the newlyweds have been gallivanting around France, Hyde broke into Christian&#039;s office building using a high-tech hacking device and stole important information. Since when does being a fiction editor at a small-time publishing company prepare you for corporate espionage? Which uni did he go to?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anastasia&#039;s promotion:&lt;/strong&gt; Speaking of SIP, once Ana returns from her honeymoon, she discovers that Christian has not only &lt;strong&gt;Fixer Upper&lt;/strong&gt;&#039;d the sh*t out of her new office (a Pinterest dream, to be honest), but that she&#039;s also gotten a huge promotion. She&#039;s totally thrown by the news (she literally says, &quot;I got a promotion?&quot;), taking in the fancy new space and title looking like a deer in the headlights. Does she not have email, or . . . ? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hyde&#039;s universal key:&lt;/strong&gt; OK, but really, though - &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; does Hyde break into Christian and Ana&#039;s penthouse? This man used to read fiction for a living and now he&#039;s running around Seattle in a khaki jumpsuit, acting like he&#039;s the villain in an action thriller opposite The Rock. Regardless, he&#039;s able to sneak in without any of the Greys&#039; 900 bodyguards realising, leave a threatening note &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; hold Ana at knifepoint before she&#039;s rescued by her two personal bodyguards, Sawyer (Brant Daugherty) and Prescott (Kirsten Alter). Prescott gets the upper hand, throwing him to the ground, but doesn&#039;t have anything to restrain him. Cue Anastasia chiming in about how she and Christian have plenty of extra handcuffs laying around. OK, girl.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The mysterious case of Ana&#039;s missing bodyguard:&lt;/strong&gt; While Sawyer remains with Anastasia until the end of the movie, Prescott disappears after apprehending Hyde, never to be seen or heard from again. Maybe she just got sick of listening to all the sounds coming from the &quot;playroom&quot;? I mean, I&#039;ve shared a dorm room. I can commiserate.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is every man in Fifty Shades identical?&lt;/strong&gt; With the exception of Hyde (who looks like he hasn&#039;t slept or showered in weeks and subsists on Monster energy drinks alone), all the guys in this movie look the same. At one point, there&#039;s a scene featuring Christian, Ana&#039;s bodyguard Sawyer, and her new author, Boyce Fox (Tyler Hoechlin), all muscular white men of relatively above-average heights with dark hair and significant scruff. It&#039;s like a slightly more rugged version of that &lt;a href=&quot;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-09/30/11/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane01/sub-buzz-13978-1475250028-1.jpg?downsize=715:*&amp;amp;output-format=auto&amp;amp;output-quality=auto&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;white guys/Saltines meme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poor Tyler Hoechlin:&lt;/strong&gt; Speaking of Hoechlin, I hope he&#039;s on the hunt for a new agent. The actor, who&#039;s been in everything from &lt;strong&gt;Everybody Wants Some!!&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;Teen Wolf&lt;/strong&gt;, plays a hot new author assigned to Anastasia&#039;s division at SIP. He&#039;s written a book with an unfortunately designed cover called &lt;strong&gt;Purgatory&lt;/strong&gt; (which is written on the front in garish red font that looks like Comic Sans dipped in blood) and sits down with her in a scene that lasts for less than one minute. Then Christian comes in, furious that his wife would dare have a private meeting with another man. After that, like Prescott, Boyce vanishes from the movie. He&#039;s, no joke, in it for one minute and three seconds, if I&#039;m being generous. Maybe it&#039;s because I used to be a huge &lt;strong&gt;Teen Wolf&lt;/strong&gt; fan (#noshame), but I feel like he deserved more than that.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ana&#039;s showdown with Gia:&lt;/strong&gt; At one point Christian takes Ana to a gorgeous old mansion, which he informs her he bought for them to start a life in. He&#039;s also hired family friend and architect Gia Matteo (Arielle Kebbel) to tear it down and design a new space, and she clearly has the hots for her new client. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/Fifty-Shades-Freed-Scene-Ana-Gia-44549369&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ana is not cool with Gia&#039;s flirty behaviour&lt;/a&gt; and shuts it down before uttering one of the most unnecessarily savage lines I&#039;ve ever heard in my entire life: &quot;You can go and climb into your sh*t-coloured car and drive back to Seattle.&quot; I gasped, choked and screamed simultaneously.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol start=&quot;10&quot;&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/Jamie-Dornan-Really-Singing-Fifty-Shades-Freed-44563027&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Christian&#039;s performance&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Guys. &lt;em&gt;Guys&lt;/em&gt;. I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;ve ever cringed harder than I did while watching this scene. Shortly after bringing Ana, his sister Mia (Rita Ora), brother Elliot (Luke Grimes), and more pals up to the Grey family mountain house to get away from it all, Christian sits down at the home&#039;s piano and starts singing. His pick? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/Jamie-Dornan-Song-Fifty-Shades-Freed-Soundtrack-44484795&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe I&#039;m Amazed&quot; by Paul McCartney and Wings&lt;/a&gt;. Jamie Dornan isn&#039;t the worst singer in the world, but the scene is deeply uncomfortable and so out of character. Just look at the reactions he gets from Ana, Mia and Elliot above (my face was personally the closest to Elliot&#039;s).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ben and Jerry&#039;s:&lt;/strong&gt; Later that night, Ana decides to drown her sorrows of knowing her husband will never win &lt;strong&gt;American Idol&lt;/strong&gt; in a pint of vanilla Ben and Jerry&#039;s. First of all, when shelling out $9 for a half-litre of Ben and Jerry&#039;s, who chooses vanilla? Was that the prop master&#039;s subtle dig at how sexless this sex movie really is? Second of all, if I&#039;m only buying ice cream to later drizzle it on my partner&#039;s hairy thighs (as Ana does), you can bet I&#039;m not purchasing the most expensive one in the freezer. My bank account and I will make do with a $4 tub and be on our way.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hyde&#039;s true motives:&lt;/strong&gt; Throughout most of the film, Ana and Christian can&#039;t seem to figure out why Hyde has it out for them (why they &quot;owe him a life&quot;). They&#039;re truly baffled, and the reasoning is revealed in one of the most bizarre plot twists of all time later on, but like . . . Christian gets Hyde fired from his job in &lt;strong&gt;Fifty Shades Darker&lt;/strong&gt;. In this economy, that&#039;s reason enough to carry out an elaborate vendetta. Do they just forget about that or what?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ana&#039;s courtroom &quot;disguise&quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; When Anastasia finds out that Hyde is being arraigned in a courtroom downtown, she immediately decides she needs to go see it for . . . some reason. She slips in the back in what&#039;s supposed to be a disguise, but it&#039;s actually just big sunglasses and her hair kind of in her face. Hyde sees and recognises her immediately. Obviously.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elliot&#039;s proposal:&lt;/strong&gt; Elliot proposes to his girlfriend and Ana&#039;s BFF, Kate (Eloise Mumford), in a loud club (A CLUB!!!). He&#039;s from one of the wealthiest families in Seattle, and he chooses to ask Kate to marry him as servers are walking around with giant trays of shots and Pitbull is playing in the background. Sorry, I&#039;ll never get over it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The running commentary about Gia&#039;s boobs:&lt;/strong&gt; Not only does Gia get made fun of for having a poop-brown car (apparently) but also for her bra size. Elliot, Kate, and Anastasia all make comments about how big, and likely fake, Gia&#039;s boobs are throughout the movie. I&#039;m no Victoria&#039;s Secret employee, but they didn&#039;t really seem big enough to warrant such attention. And also, it just makes Elliot, Kate and Anastasia seem like real d*cks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol start=&quot;16&quot;&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mia being kidnapped:&lt;/strong&gt; Mia gets kidnapped by Hyde after giving her bodyguard the slip, which it&#039;s mentioned she&#039;s done a few times earlier on in the movie. Where does Christian find these awful bodyguards? The Paul Blart School of Private Security?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ana&#039;s harebrained scheme to get $5 million:&lt;/strong&gt; When Hyde tells Ana she needs to bring him $5 million in cash and not alert Christian or the police - or else he&#039;ll kill Mia - she organises this whole plan to escape her own bodyguard (seriously, dude? YOU HAVE ONE JOB), heads to the bank, and demands an executive take the money out of Christian&#039;s account. And then . . . the guy immediately calls Christian to tell him what&#039;s up. Obviously! It&#039;s like no one in this movie has the ability to think beyond 10 minutes into the future.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hyde kicking pregnant Anastasia right in the stomach:&lt;/strong&gt; I don&#039;t really have anything else to say about this other than DEAR LORD.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hyde&#039;s true master plan:&lt;/strong&gt; OK, so after all is said and done (i.e., after Anastasia shoots Hyde in the leg and he&#039;s arrested, Mia is set free, and the baby survives - yeesh), it turns out that the reason Hyde went after Christian wasn&#039;t because he lost his job at SIP. It&#039;s because - dun dun dunnn - he and Christian grew up in the same foster home together as kids in Detroit. Because Christian was a few years younger (and not a psycho) (hah, just kidding - not as &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; a psycho), the wealthy Grey family chose to adopt him instead: Christian reaped the rewards of a family with money, while Hyde was left to rot in the system (and yet still become successful in the publishing industry, but I guess that&#039;s neither here nor there). That&#039;s why Hyde thinks Christian &quot;owes&quot; him &quot;a life.&quot; &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christian&#039;s terrible memory:&lt;/strong&gt; HOW DOES CHRISTIAN NOT REMEMBER GROWING UP WITH HYDE? He&#039;s all, &quot;Ugh, I was really young back then - way too little to form lasting memories.&quot; But then Anastasia pulls out a photo of him and Hyde and he&#039;s &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; around 10 years old. Also, did I mention that this &quot;twist&quot; comes in literally the last five minutes of the movie? The writers just drop it in and then move on (which, ironically enough, I&#039;ll never be able to do with my life after seeing this movie).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol start=&quot;21&quot;&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The entire movie, basically:&lt;/strong&gt; This movie is a wild, butt plug-filled emotional roller coaster from start to finish, making it an extremely entertaining way to spend 105 minutes. If you don&#039;t believe me, just ask the two elderly women sitting in front of me in the cinema who scream-sang Ellie Goulding&#039;s &quot;Love Me Like You Do&quot; and pumped their fists with glee as Anastasia and Christian walked off into the sunset with their toddler and the credits rolled.\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n</description>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com.au/latest/Fifty Shades Freed\">Fifty Shades Freed</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com.au/latest/Movies\">Movies</category>\n <pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 10:05:36 +1100</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Quinn Keaney</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">44573374</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>Best Moments in Fifty Shades Freed</search_title>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title>Aaron Paul and Lauren Parsekian Chose a Baby Name That&#039;s Out of a Fairy Tale</title>\n <link>https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/What-Did-Aaron-Paul-Lauren-Parsekian-Name-Baby-44594321</link>\n <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/What-Did-Aaron-Paul-Lauren-Parsekian-Name-Baby-44594321&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;160&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; src=&quot;https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/U5AoxZGJKnpS5ulcG5zPn8KrLkQ/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/02/16/764/n/1922398/c3a4a9945a8712fa946701.41081552_edit_img_image_14364447_1518801358.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-permalink=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BfBf3dAHr5_/&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;8&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot; class=&quot;insta-preview-v1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=&#039;  line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%; background:url(&quot;https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/e036f239870f3b6e1aab87c608a6d76e/5B1F757D/t51.2885-15/e35/27574023_145684102771267_4940991937084653568_n.jpg&quot;); background-size:contain;&#039;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BfBf3dAHr5_/&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A post shared by Lauren Paul (@laurenpaul8)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2018-02-10T16:47:09+00:00&quot;&gt;Feb 10, 2018 at 8:47am PST&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Aaron Paul and his wife, Lauren Parsekian, welcomed their first child, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Aaron-Paul-Lauren-Parsekian-Welcome-Baby-Girl-44568550&quot; &gt;a beautiful baby girl&lt;/a&gt;, earlier this month, and now we finally know &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/aaron-paul-welcomes-baby-girl-with-wife-lauren-pics/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;her name&lt;/a&gt;.

Sometimes the post-credits scenes end up meaning nothing and are just fun interludes, where others connect the Avengers in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Postcredits-Scene-Black-Panther-44585729&quot; &gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black Panther&lt;/strong&gt;&#039;s two post-credits scenes&lt;/a&gt; are both important to the MCU at large, but the second one is significant in the sense that it connects back to a previous Avengers movie. (Warning: spoilers follow!)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That previous point is important, because unlike many of the MCU movies, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/tag/Black-Panther&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black Panther&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; only features a couple characters (besides T&#039;Challa himself) that we&#039;ve already met in an Avengers movie. That lets the movie stand on its own, but the end credits scenes - especially the final one - remind us that &lt;strong&gt;Black Panther&lt;/strong&gt;, like Wakanda, is not alone in its world. So let&#039;s get back to the scene: in it, we&#039;re in a village in Wakanda. A couple of kids stare down a person sleeping, and when he stumbles out into the sun, we see it&#039;s Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan). He&#039;s greeted by Shuri (Letitia Wright), who&#039;s clearly there to check on him. She asks how he is, and says he still has work to do. (He&#039;s also called the &quot;White Wolf&quot; - a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Postcredits-Scene-Black-Panther-44585729&quot; &gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black Panther&lt;/strong&gt; comics character&lt;/a&gt; that seems like it will have significance later.) Confused? Don&#039;t remember when you last saw Bucky? Here&#039;s what you forgot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The last Avengers movie Bucky Barnes was in prior to this was &lt;strong&gt;Captain America: Civil War&lt;/strong&gt;. After being on the run - as the Winter Soldier, he had committed ghastly crimes - Cap has to keep him away from Tony Stark&#039;s wrath, whose parents Bucky had killed in 1991 while he was brainwashed by Hydra. Stark strips Bucky of his robotic arm, and then Cap smuggles Bucky to Wakanda, where he has asylum. He chooses to go back into cryogenic sleep (gotta keep looking young) since he&#039;s unable to fight the brainwashing himself. (It&#039;s also interesting that Bucky ends up in Wakanda since T&#039;Challa originally believes Bucky to be responsible for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/How-Did-Black-Panther-Father-Die-44587913&quot; &gt;his father&#039;s death&lt;/a&gt;, as he&#039;d been framed by Helmut Zemo.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So to connect the dots, Bucky has been in recovery, but is now out of cryogenic sleep, and being cared for by the brilliant Shuri - which connects back to an earlier easter egg in the movie, when she receives a dying Everett Ross and remarks that he&#039;s &quot;another broken white boy to fix.&quot; Those words confirm that she either &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; fixed Bucky or is well on her way. Arm or no arm, he certainly looks great when he greets her, which bodes well for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/Which-Marvel-Characters-Avengers-Infinity-War-44316847&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;his future in May&#039;s &lt;strong&gt;Avengers: Infinity War&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com.au/latest/Black Panther\">Black Panther</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com.au/latest/Movies\">Movies</category>\n <pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 20:07:03 +1100</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Shannon Vestal Robson</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">44593621</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>What Does the Second End Credits Scene in Black Panther Mean</search_title>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title>Desperate For UnReal to Return?

As for the timelines offered below? They were decided on by the couple themselves. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prince Harry and Meghan Markle&#039;s wedding service will begin at St George&#039;s Chapel at 12 p.m. on Saturday May 19, UK time. That makes it 11 p.m. AEST. (We can expect every major network to be covering live, so you&#039;ll have the pick of the bunch when it comes to tuning in.) &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The service will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Right Reverend David Conner. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prince Harry and Meghan&#039;s vows will be officiated (exciting!) by Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;After the ceremony, the couple will head to Windsor Castle right next door. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At 1 p.m. UK time (midnight AEST) the newly-married couple will take a quick trip in carriage procession from Windsor Castle through the surrounding streets and back again, so as to maximise the interaction they can have with the crowds that will no doubt have been waiting hours to catch a glimpse.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/HarryandMeghan?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#HarryandMeghan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoyalWedding?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#RoyalWedding&lt;/a&gt;  the route &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/LUUCBfWdTo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/LUUCBfWdTo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;- Marlene Koenig \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@royalmusing) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/royalmusing/status/962853067086495744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;February 12, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;While the couple is in the procession, the reception will kick off at St George&#039;s Hall.

You should sit down for this story, because it&#039;s a doozy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the early hours of July 9, 1982, just two weeks after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/Princess-Diana-Pictures-Young-Prince-William-Harry-30909204&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Princess Diana gave birth to Prince William&lt;/a&gt;, a man was seen &quot;on the railings near the gates to the ambassadors&#039; entrance&quot; at Buckingham Palace, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/22/world/text-of-scotland-yard-s-report-on-july-9-intrusion-into-buckingham-palace.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;according to a report by Scotland Yard&lt;/a&gt;. It was about 6:45 a.m. when the man, Michael Fagan, climbed over the railings and entered a room on the ground floor of the building through an unlocked window. This room housed the $20 million Royal Stamp Collection, and because all the other doors were locked, Fagan came out through the same window before entering again, this time climbing a drainpipe to get to the roof. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;related-stories&quot;&gt;Related&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/home/Queen-Elizabeth-II-Real-Estate-38361330&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A Mind-Blowing Tour of Queen Elizabeth II&#039;s Many Castles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fagan removed his socks and sandals, then climbed through another unlocked window into the office of the Master of the Household, Sir Peter Ashmore, which had been &quot;opened for the day by a housemaid.&quot; For the next 15 minutes or so, he was able to move through the corridors unnoticed. His behaviour &quot;was not sufficiently suspicious&quot; enough to raise the alarm of a palace staff remember who later remembered seeing Fagan in the house. An alarm sensor that detected his movements went off, but police thought it was &quot;faulty,&quot; so they silenced it. Fagan admitted to police that he &quot;followed the pictures&quot; and was able to find his way to the palace&#039;s private apartments. He first headed to a waiting room, where he broke a glass ashtray into several pieces, then casually headed into the queen&#039;s bedroom - as in, Her Majesty the Queen. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At about 7:15, barefoot, dishevelled, and carrying one of the broken ashtray pieces (which he later said that he planned to slash his wrists with), Fagan opened curtains close to the bed where Queen Elizabeth II was sleeping. He was bleeding from a lacerated hand, staining the royal linens. Startled but calm, she pressed the alarm bell, which coincidentally didn&#039;t grab anyone&#039;s attention; the police sergeant scheduled to stand outside her bedroom at night had recently ended his shift, and the domestic staff member who was on duty had gone out to walk the Corgis. A maid was in another room with the door closed, so as not to disturb the queen with her noise. What are the odds, right? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While initial reports said that Elizabeth tried to make conversation with Fagan in an effort to stall him until help arrived, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/michael-fagan-her-nightie-was-one-of-those-liberty-prints-down-to-her-knees-7179547.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fagan himself denied this claim&lt;/a&gt; in a 2012 interview. He detailed that Elizabeth, wearing a Liberty-print nightgown that was &quot;down to her knees,&quot; yelled &quot;What are you doing here?!&quot; before she &quot;ran out of the room; her little bare feet running across the floor.&quot; Apparently, Fagan then asked for some cigarettes, which were brought by the maid who had been cleaning in the next room. Duty footman Paul Whybrew, who had been walking the queen&#039;s dogs, finally showed up, followed by two policemen on palace duty who removed Fagan from the bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;pullquote-container&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;source&quot;&gt;Image Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://gettyimages.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Getty / Erica Echenberg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In his own account, Fagan admitted that the night he was arrested was actually the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; time he&#039;d broken into Buckingham Palace; about a month earlier, he managed to &quot;spend most of the night inside&quot; after climbing in through a maid&#039;s bedroom window. The maid was shocked to see him and ran straight to security, but because they didn&#039;t find him in her room, they convinced her that she had imagined the whole thing. Fagan was able to explore the palace and admitted to having quite the adventure - he reportedly spent hours wandering around, eating cheese and crackers, viewing royal portraits, and even &quot;resting for a while&quot; on the throne. Fagan also spoke of walking into a mail room where Princess Diana had hidden gifts for William, who had only recently been born. Fagan said that he &quot;drank half a bottle of white wine&quot; from Prince Charles&#039;s room - a &quot;cheap Californian&quot; - and because he couldn&#039;t find a bathroom, he peed into a bin marked &quot;Corgi food&quot; (as one does) before eventually getting tired and leaving. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, Fagan was unemployed and his wife, Christine, whom he shared four children with, had recently left him before the first break-in. Of his behaviour, he said, &quot;I don&#039;t know why I did it, something just got into my head,&quot; and he also blamed the his actions on taking too many mushrooms months earlier. Because he technically didn&#039;t commit a criminal offence, Fagan wasn&#039;t charged for trespassing in the queen&#039;s bedroom - though he was charged with theft (of Charles&#039; wine). The charges were later dropped when Fagan was committed for psychiatric evaluation. He spent six months in a psychiatric hospital and was released in January 1983. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;related-stories&quot;&gt;Related&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/Buckingham-Palace-Facts-44093946&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;15 Facts You Didn&#039;t Know About Buckingham Palace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Fagan&#039;s palace break-ins were not his last brushes with the law: two years after his Buckingham adventure, he attacked a policeman at a Wales cafe, and three years after that, he was found guilty of indecent exposure in London. He got back together with his wife at some point, and in 1997, they, along with their 20-year-old son, were charged with conspiracy to sell heroin. In the wake of Fagan&#039;s break-ins, more security devices were installed in and around the royal residences, though people have still managed to scale the 14-ft.-high fences since. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After being awakened by a strange man in her bedroom and having to wait damn near an eternity for the police to arrive, Queen Elizabeth II carried on with the day&#039;s royal duties as planned, because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Queen-Elizabeth-II-Funniest-Quotes-44563945&quot; &gt;she&#039;s a total badass&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com.au/latest/Buckingham Palace\">Buckingham Palace</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com.au/latest/The British Royals\">The British Royals</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com.au/latest/Queen Elizabeth II\">Queen Elizabeth II</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com.au/latest/Celebrity Facts\">Celebrity Facts</category>\n <category domain=\"https://www.popsugar.com.au/latest/The Royals\">The Royals</category>\n <pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 16:05:13 +1100</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Brittney Stephens</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">44577679</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>Man Who Broke Into the Queen&#039;s Bedroom at Buckingham Palace</search_title>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title>What Is Going On?

Willie Garson, who played Stanford Blatch, later seemed to confirm the reports when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/willie-garson-kim-cattrall-to-blame-for-satc-3-cancellation-w506280/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he retweeted the &lt;strong&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/strong&gt;&#039;s article&lt;/a&gt;, writing, &quot;And that, is that. And sadly, the reasons are true. Period.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 29, 2017: Kim speaks out.&lt;/strong&gt; Shortly after, the actress responded to the reports on Twitter.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Woke 2 a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MailOnline?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@MailOnline&lt;/a&gt; \ud83d\udca9storm! The only &#039;DEMAND&#039; I ever made was that I didn&#039;t want to do a 3rd film....&amp;amp; that was back in 2016&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;- Kim Cattrall (@KimCattrall) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KimCattrall/status/913712496237776897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;September 29, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oct. 3, 2017: Kim tells her side of the story.&lt;/strong&gt; During an appearance on Piers Morgan&#039;s &lt;strong&gt;Life Stories&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4946594/Kim-Cattrall-Sex-City-stars-toxic.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kim denied rumours that she made any demands&lt;/a&gt; and talked about her relationship with Sarah. &quot;It&#039;s quite extraordinary to get any kind of negative press about something that I&#039;ve been saying for almost a year of &#039;no&#039; that I&#039;m demanding or a diva,&quot; Kim stated. &quot;This is really where I take to task the people from &lt;strong&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/strong&gt; and specifically Sarah Jessica Parker in that I think she could have been nicer. I don&#039;t know what her issue is, I never have.&quot; Kim also revealed that she was never actually friends with the cast. &quot;We&#039;ve never been friends,&quot; she explained. &quot;We&#039;ve been colleagues and in some way, it&#039;s a very healthy place to be.&quot;  &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jan. 10, 2018: Sarah makes light of the drama.&lt;/strong&gt; While promoting her show &lt;strong&gt;Divorce&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;The Late Show&lt;/strong&gt;, Sarah joked that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.etonline.com/sarah-jessica-parker-jokes-stephen-colbert-could-play-samantha-sex-and-city-3-94075&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stephen Colbert could take on the role of Samantha&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;According to just very recent documentation about why we&#039;re not making it [&lt;strong&gt;Sex and the City 3&lt;/strong&gt;] is because the part usually played by Kim Cattrall has been vacated,&quot; Sarah explained. &quot;Perhaps you&#039;d want to play Samantha?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jan. 17, 2018: Sarah also offers the role to Ellen DeGeneres.&lt;/strong&gt; During a stop on &lt;strong&gt;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eonline.com/news/906911/sarah-jessica-parker-wants-ellen-degeneres-to-play-samantha-in-sex-and-the-city-3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sarah proposed that Ellen audition for the role of Samantha&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;There&#039;s a period of grief, a mourning process, and then perhaps we&#039;ll be able to consider, say for instance, you playing Samantha,&quot; Sarah said. &quot;I&#039;ll offer you the same opportunity.&quot; &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jan. 17, 2018: Kim gets word of Sarah&#039;s suggestion. &lt;/strong&gt;Following Sarah&#039;s appearance on &lt;strong&gt;Ellen&lt;/strong&gt;, Kim responded to the news on Twitter, writing, &quot;She&#039;d be fabulous! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;She&#039;d be fabulous! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;- Kim Cattrall (@KimCattrall) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KimCattrall/status/953742174817931266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;January 17, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feb. 8, 2018: Sarah sends her condolences to Kim following her brother&#039;s death.&lt;/strong&gt; After finding out that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/04/us/chris-cattrall-dies-brother-of-kim/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kim&#039;s brother passed away&lt;/a&gt; in February, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.etonline.com/sarah-jessica-parker-reveals-possibility-of-a-third-sex-and-the-city-movie-happening-exclusive&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sarah offered her condolences to Kim&lt;/a&gt; and her family. &quot;I can&#039;t begin to know how her family is managing such a loss,&quot; Sarah told &lt;strong&gt;Extra&lt;/strong&gt;. &quot;We all send her our love and condolences and grant her the privacy that she&#039;s asked for.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feb. 10, 2018: Kim lashes out at Sarah.&lt;/strong&gt; Just days after Sarah publicly reached out, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsugar.com.au/celebrity/Kim-Cattrall-Quotes-About-Sarah-Jessica-Parker-February-2018-44573005&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kim called out Sarah on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, claiming her support was insincere. &quot;My Mom asked me today &#039;When will that [Sarah], that hypocrite, leave you alone?&#039;&quot; Kim wrote. &quot;Your continuous reaching out is a painful reminder of how cruel you really were then and now.&quot; She also included a link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2017/10/07/inside-the-mean-girls-culture-that-destroyed-sex-and-the-city/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;New York Post&lt;/strong&gt;&#039;s article&lt;/a&gt; that chronicled &quot;the mean-girls culture that destroyed&quot; the show.
