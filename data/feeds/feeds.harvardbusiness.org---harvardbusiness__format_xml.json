Your title alone isn&amp;#8217;t always enough to sway others, nor do you always have a formal position. So, what&amp;#8217;s the best way to position yourself as an informal leader? How do you motivate colleagues to support your initiatives and adopt your ideas? How can you become a go-to person that others look to for guidance and expert advice?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the Experts Say&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nHaving influence in the workplace has &amp;#8220;clear value,&amp;#8221; says Dorie Clark, author of &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/product/entrepreneurial-you-monetize-your-expertise-create-multiple-income-streams-and-thrive/10075-HBK-ENG\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entrepreneurial You&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#8220;You get more done and you advance the projects you care about and are responsible for,&amp;#8221; which means &amp;#8220;you&amp;#8217;re more likely to be noticed, get promoted, and receive raises.&amp;#8221; But gaining influence in the modern workplace is difficult, according to Nick Morgan, author of&amp;#160;&lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/product/power-cues-the-subtle-science-of-leading-groups-persuading-others-and-maximizing-your-personal-impact/an/11710-HBK-ENG\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power Cues&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &amp;#8220;&lt;/em&gt;It&amp;#8217;s never been harder to influence others, because they&amp;#8217;ve never been more distracted,&amp;#8221; he says. &amp;#8220;Information overload and the pace of our digital lives have [led to short attention spans].&amp;#8221; And yet, &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8217;s more important than ever to be able to command influence, because of the increased pressure on getting results.&amp;#8221; It all comes down to your approach. Here are some tips.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build connections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nIt&amp;#8217;s not quite a junior high school popularity contest, but &amp;#8220;at a fundamental level, one of the reasons that people do things for you&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; support your idea, or approve your budget &amp;#8212; &amp;#8220;is because they like you,&amp;#8221; Clark says. You don&amp;#8217;t have to be &amp;#8220;the awesome-est person in the room&amp;#8221; or make sure &amp;#8220;everyone is blown away&amp;#160;by your charisma.&amp;#8221; You just need to have good rapport with your colleagues. This won&amp;#8217;t translate directly into influence, of course, but it does &amp;#8220;make it more likely that others will at least hear you out.&amp;#8221; So, work on cultivating &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/07/connect-then-lead\"&gt;personal connections&lt;/a&gt; with your colleagues, and allow them to get to know you. &amp;#8220;That way, they won&amp;#8217;t impute negative intentions or motives to you.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen before you try to persuade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nThe best way to prime colleagues for backing you and your agenda is to make them feel heard. Start by giving them your undivided attention in one-on-one situations. &amp;#8220;Most of us walk around with a running to-do list in our heads,&amp;#8221;&amp;#160;Morgan says, and it shows. We&amp;#8217;re fidgety, preoccupied, or ready to reach for our phones. Instead, you should &amp;#8220;practice the discipline of focus.&amp;#8221; To do this, &amp;#8220;turn your body toward the other person, freeze in place, and listen.&amp;#8221; Clark agrees: &amp;#8220;A big part of workplace resentment is people feeling disrespected and that their voices aren&amp;#8217;t being heard.&amp;#8221; So, ask colleagues for their perspectives and advice.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind your body language (and your tone)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nPeople are constantly assessing whether to trust you or not, Morgan says. &amp;#8220;[We&amp;#8217;re] hardwired to be asking the question, &amp;#8216;Is this person a friend or foe? Is this person trying to undercut me, or are we on the same side?&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221; Your &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2008/11/how-to-become-an-authentic-speaker\"&gt;body language&lt;/a&gt; is critical to conveying the right message. Standing up straight with your shoulders back helps you come across as confident and commanding; slouching and looking down at your feet has the opposite effect. &amp;#8220;When you adopt a certain [slumping] posture, you think in subordinate terms and you talk in subordinate terms, and it increases the likelihood that you&amp;#8217;ll be seen as less authoritative,&amp;#8221; Morgan says. Say, for instance, you have a meeting with a colleague you don&amp;#8217;t know well from another division. Morgan suggests signaling that you are a friend by keeping your arms uncrossed, your hands by your sides, and &amp;#8220;your torso open and pointed at the other person.&amp;#8221; He also advises &amp;#8220;pitching your voice a little lower than you normally do&amp;#8221; in order to connote power. &amp;#8220;This is useful to work on because it counteracts the effect of nervousness, which tends to push your tone higher.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop expertise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nAnother way to increase your influence at work is to &amp;#8220;be seen as a recognized expert&amp;#8221; within your industry or organization, Clark says. This won&amp;#8217;t happen overnight, but you can take steps to develop business-critical &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/04/make-yourself-an-expert\"&gt;expertise and knowhow&lt;/a&gt;. She suggests &amp;#8220;immersing yourself in your topic area&amp;#8221; by regularly attending industry conferences, enrolling in a class or specialized certification program, or taking on a leadership role in a relevant professional organization. &amp;#8220;Those are visible and public signs&amp;#8221; that you are staying up-to-date and informed, she says. Don&amp;#8217;t keep your knowledge under wraps. &amp;#8220;Blogging about your subject on LinkedIn or for your company newsletter&amp;#8221; is another way to show what you know.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Map a strategy &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nWhen it comes time to leverage the influence you&amp;#8217;ve built to promote a particular initiative or idea, be strategic. Clark recommends creating a &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/11/a-campaign-strategy-for-your-career\"&gt;power map&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; to guide your campaign. &amp;#8220;Create an org chart of decision makers related to your issue,&amp;#8221; she says. As you go through the levels, &amp;#8220;ask yourself, &amp;#8216;Can I influence this person directly? If not, whom can I influence&amp;#160;who can influence that person?&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221; Then begin to think about how and when you will approach these various colleagues. &amp;#8220;War-game the situation,&amp;#8221; she says. &amp;#8220;Who might be threatened by your plans, and how can you bring them over to your side?&amp;#8221; You&amp;#8217;re not scheming; you&amp;#8217;re strategizing.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give people what they want&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nYou can increase your influence on a particular issue by authentically framing it as a benefit to the people you want on your side. Consider each stakeholder&amp;#8217;s needs, perspectives, and temperaments. &amp;#8220;Do your homework to find out what they need to hear and what will capture their attention,&amp;#8221; Morgan says. For each person, &amp;#8220;make sure you&amp;#8217;re answering the question, &amp;#8216;What&amp;#8217;s in it for me?&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221; He also recommends talking about how an idea will &amp;#8220;benefit the organization&amp;#8221; as a whole. &amp;#8220;Use the word &amp;#8216;we,&amp;#8217; as in &amp;#8216;We&amp;#8217;ll see value,&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221; he says. Clark concurs. &amp;#8220;If your proposal is fundamentally self-interested, people won&amp;#8217;t line up.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principles to Remember&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Cultivate personal connections with colleagues so they assume positive intent when you attempt to influence them.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Make it clear to your colleagues that you value their opinions.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Take steps to develop expertise by attending conferences or taking on a leadership role in a professional organization.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Worry that your attempts to gain sway are manipulative. You&amp;#8217;re being strategic.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Slouch as you talk. Standing up straight with your shoulders back helps you come across as confident and commanding.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Use &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8221; too much. In your quest for influence, talk about how your ideas will benefit the entire organization and how &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8221; will see value.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case Study #1: Stay current and build relationships with your colleagues so that you understand what motivates them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nMarcy Shinder, chief marketing officer at Work Market, the New York City&amp;#8211;based firm that helps businesses manage their freelancers and consultants, was working on establishing herself as an influential member of the team before she even started the job.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Before her first day of work, she arranged to meet several colleagues for informal coffees and lunches &amp;#8211; one-on-one meetings that were &amp;#8220;more personal, less structured, and allowed us to establish rapport.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;I went in with a listening agenda,&amp;#8221; she explains. &amp;#8220;I wanted to learn: What are their goals? What is important to them? What do they think is working at the company? And what do they want me to accomplish?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Marcy made sure her body language conveyed that she was fully focused on these conversations. She sat up straight, made eye contact, and looked open and engaged. &amp;#8220;Body language is so important &amp;#8212; we coach salespeople on it,&amp;#8221; she says. &amp;#8220;I tried to listen with intent.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Those early meetings allowed her to understand the perspectives, personalities, and motives of her colleagues, which proved to be useful when she recently had an idea to revamp the company&amp;#8217;s website and needed their support to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to those early one-on-one conversations, she could customize her pitch to each individual. For example, with Stephen Dewitt, the CEO, she talked about the company&amp;#8217;s vision. With Jeff Wald, the president and COO, an analytic thinker, she started with the metrics. And with the chief customer officer, she focused on the customer side.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It is the same story, just with a different emphasis,&amp;#8221; she says. Her efforts paid off. The new Work Market website will go live this spring.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Another way Marcy increases her influence is by staying up-to-date on industry trends and news. &amp;#8220;I spend 25% of my time talking to customers, other chief marketing officers, people on boards of companies, potential customers, and mentoring young people,&amp;#8221; she says. &amp;#8220;By doing that, I stay informed and I have a finger on the pulse of what&amp;#8217;s happening beyond the four walls of this company.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case Study #2:&amp;#160;Create a message that resonates, and forge a path for others to become proponents &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nGeorge Gallegos, CEO of Jitterbit, the data integration&amp;#160;software provider based in Oakland, California, is not a top-down leader. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s not &amp;#8216;my way or the highway,&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221; he says. &amp;#8220;I want people to feel that they have a voice and are part of the decision-making process.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In 2011, when&amp;#160;Gallegos first started at Jitterbit, the company had about 50 customers. George knew the company&amp;#8217;s future was in the cloud, but &amp;#8220;it was a new territory, and it was going to be a challenge,&amp;#8221; he recalls. &amp;#8220;It required engineering resources being diverted and getting investors comfortable with that, and we had to make sure marketing could figure out how we were going to reposition ourselves.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;George began strategizing about how he would win support for the change. The toughest sell was going to be &amp;#8220;Jeff&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; Jitterbit&amp;#8217;s senior technology leader &amp;#8212; who was skeptical of the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;George reflected on Jeff&amp;#8217;s personality in order to craft a message that would resonate with him. &amp;#8220;I knew he was passionate about customer success and that &amp;#8212; like me &amp;#8212; he hated losing,&amp;#8221; he says. &amp;#8220;So I knew I had to give Jeff visibility into the challenges we were facing&amp;#8221;&amp;#160;by&amp;#160;maintained the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;George brought Jeff to a two-day pitch meeting with a potential Jitterbit client. &amp;#8220;I brought him into the trenches, and I let him get bloodied up with me,&amp;#8221; George says. &amp;#8220;I wanted him to feel the customer&amp;#8217;s pain.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Jitterbit had its first cloud-based release in 2012. Today the company has 50,000 customers.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=zWXD7S2yfGM:1qdePTLP-C4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=zWXD7S2yfGM:1qdePTLP-C4:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/harvardbusiness/~4/zWXD7S2yfGM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><feedburner:origLink>https://hbr.org/2018/02/how-to-increase-your-influence-at-work</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><title>How to Fix the Most Soul-Crushing Meetings</title><id>tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.194865</id><link href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~r/harvardbusiness/~3/qReo3Rh87RA/how-to-fix-the-most-soul-crushing-meetings\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" /><updated>2018-02-16T18:20:27Z</updated><published>2018-02-16T14:00:43Z</published><summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>The root of the problem might be deeper than you realize.</p>\n]]></summary><author><name>Ron Carucci</name></author><category term=\"Meetings\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Meetings\" /><category term=\"Organizational structure\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Organizational structure\" /><category term=\"Digital Article\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/contentType\" label=\"Digital Article\" /><content type=\"html\" xml:base=\"https://hbr.org/2018/02/how-to-fix-the-most-soul-crushing-meetings\" xml:lang=\"en\">&lt;div class=\"mbn pbn\"&gt;\r\n&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-194974\" src=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-16-139307363-emma-mayfield-photography.jpg\" srcset=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-16-139307363-emma-mayfield-photography-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-16-139307363-emma-mayfield-photography-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-16-139307363-emma-mayfield-photography-500x281.jpg 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-16-139307363-emma-mayfield-photography-383x215.jpg 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-16-139307363-emma-mayfield-photography-383x215.jpg 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-16-139307363-emma-mayfield-photography-500x281.jpg 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-16-139307363-emma-mayfield-photography-700x394.jpg 700w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-16-139307363-emma-mayfield-photography-850x478.jpg 850w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-16-139307363-emma-mayfield-photography-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-16-139307363-emma-mayfield-photography.jpg 1200w\" alt=\"feb18-16-139307363-emma-mayfield-photography\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" sizes=\"(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit ptn mtn\"&gt;emma mayfield photography/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Meetings&amp;#160;are notoriously one of organizational life&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/07/stop-the-meeting-madness\"&gt;most insufferable realities&lt;/a&gt;. U.S. companies spend more than &lt;a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/37-billion-is-lost-every-year-on-these-meeting-mistakes-2014-4\"&gt;$37 billion&lt;/a&gt; dollars a year on them. Employees in American companies spend more than one-third of their time in them. And &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/07/stop-the-meeting-madness\"&gt;71%&lt;/a&gt; of senior managers view them as unproductive. In one global consumer products company that I work with, my firm&amp;#8217;s organizational assessment revealed an unusually intense degree of&amp;#160;frustration over how much time was consumed by meetings, leaving &amp;#8220;only evenings to do our day jobs,&amp;#8221; according to one interviewee. In a meticulous inventory, we calculated the hours spent in meetings by directors and above across the enterprise (a population of about 500). They collectively spent more than 57,000 hours per year in recurring meetings. That&amp;#8217;s the equivalent of six and a half years!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Better meeting &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/04/a-step-by-step-guide-to-structuring-better-meetings\"&gt;techniques&lt;/a&gt;, like distributing agendas, holding stand-up meetings, or enforcing a no-device policy, are all well-intentioned practices. But none of them will salvage a meeting that shouldn&amp;#8217;t be happening in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Meetings are productive and meaningful when the people in them have a clear reason to be there, have a definitive contribution to make, and advance strategic priorities together. Any standing meeting, whether it&amp;#8217;s of a departmental leadership team, a cross-functional group owning a process like innovation or talent management, or a task force managing a six-month transition to a new technology, should be &lt;a href=\"http://www.navalent.com/resources/blog/structure-effective-organizational-governance\"&gt;designed&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;and linked to a &lt;a href=\"http://www.navalent.com/resources/musings/demystifying-organizational-governance-ensuring-right-leaders-are-making-right\"&gt;broader governance plan&lt;/a&gt;. Together, standing meetings should synchronize the entire organization in a meeting cadence that executes strategy and delivers results. But too often, meetings are disconnected from the intentional distribution of decision rights, resources, and priorities across the organization, making them unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Meetings that aren&amp;#8217;t part of effective governance design take on two destructive pathologies: they become &lt;em&gt;meetings as source of power &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;meetings as bottleneck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;When meetings become a source of power, being in charge or included affords you disproportionate degrees of influence and status. They justify their existence with lengthy presentations that most attendees find boring and irrelevant while nodding eagerly in a feigned sense of importance. In the consumer products company I mentioned above, one interviewee told us, &amp;#8220;People would get to meetings 30 minutes early to make sure they sat near the executive they wanted to be seen with.&amp;#8221; This kind of politicization leaves most leaders in meetings disempowered, employees disengaged, and meetings dysfunctional. Meetings should serve to distribute power, not concentrate it at the top. When they do, leaders are more inclined to &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v234mvaUQ4o\"&gt;use power responsibly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;article-promo class=\"article-promo promo--half\"&gt;&lt;h4 class=\"mbs\"&gt;You and Your Team Series&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;h3 class=\"mbm text-gray-light\"&gt;Meetings&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"promo-contents\"&gt;\r\n\t&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;figure class=\"mbm\"&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;img src=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2016/04/further-reading-meetings-12.png\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h6 class=\"hed mbs mtl\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/12/the-seven-imperatives-to-keeping-meetings-on-track/\"&gt;The Seven Imperatives to Keeping Meetings on Track&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/h6&gt;\r\n\t&lt;div class=\"stream-item-info\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;ul class=\"byline byline-list line-height-tight\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amy Gallo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n&lt;h6 class=\"hed mbs mtm\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/03/how-to-design-an-agenda-for-an-effective-meeting\"&gt;How to Design an Agenda for an Effective Meeting&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/h6&gt;\r\n\t&lt;div class=\"stream-item-info\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;ul class=\"byline byline-list line-height-tight\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Roger Schwarz&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n&lt;h6 class=\"hed mbs mtm\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/03/do-you-really-need-to-hold-that-meeting\"&gt;Do You Really Need to Hold That Meeting?&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/h6&gt;\r\n\t&lt;div class=\"stream-item-info\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;ul class=\"byline byline-list line-height-tight\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elizabeth Grace Saunders&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\t\t\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article-promo&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;When a meeting becomes a &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/03/how-to-finally-kill-the-useless-recurring-meeting\"&gt;bottleneck&lt;/a&gt;, decisions or resources are passing through people who likely have little or nothing to contribute, usually because &amp;#8220;they&amp;#8217;ve always been involved.&amp;#8221; Standing meetings like these are often like layers of old wallpaper pasted over one another; they&amp;#8217;ve far outlived their usefulness. At the consumer products company, many of the standing meetings were of groups that had been formed years prior and had never been dissolved as the organization evolved and shifted strategies. In fact, there were six different groups managing two different processes governing product development. Many of those groups had been formed decades earlier, each one gripping tightly to their claim over determining which projects in the pipeline moved forward with what investments. The wars between departments doubled the time required to bring a new product to market because teams were often given conflicting directions.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;These are just symptoms, however. The underlying problem is bad governance. To fix these issues in your organization, establish the following three elements.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. A clearly articulated mandate with defined decision rights. &lt;/strong&gt;Regardless of the type of meeting, the scope must be clearly defined, and narrowed to a few key areas. In another multinational company I work with, the executive team, the business unit teams, the regional teams, and the country teams were painfully duplicating work&amp;#160;&amp;#8212; everything from P&amp;#38;L management to key hiring decisions to customer relationship management. Meetings became war zones, as each group complained about how one of the other groups was undermining what they believed was theirs to do. In a holistic redesign, we created charters for each level so that they were focused on the work they could uniquely execute. Strategy and priorities were set at the executive team level. The business unit teams focused on talent, customer segmentation, and marketing. The regional and country level teams were responsible for P&amp;#38;Ls, customer relationship management, and geography-specific priorities. With these responsibilities set, they could create meeting agendas focused on what they needed to be doing (and publish them weeks in advance), and all of the requisite decision rights and resources were allocated accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. A synchronized cadence.&lt;/strong&gt; It may seem obvious, but a meeting&amp;#8217;s frequency and allotted time must be commensurate with its charter and decision rights. Teams and task forces governing near-term priorities will need to meet more frequently for shorter durations of time, while those focused on longer-term priorities should meet less often for longer durations of time. In the multinational example above, the cadence of meetings was choreographed to keep each level appropriately linked and informed. Each group met monthly for two hours: the executive team on the first Monday of the month, the business units on the second Monday, the regions on the third Monday, and the countries on the fourth. Any inputs or outputs from one to the other were immediately sent on to the next group. This also allowed each team to keep their respective organizations up to speed on progress, shifts in priorities, and their counterparts&amp;#8217; work.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. The right composition and metrics. &lt;/strong&gt;Too often leaders let hierarchy define who comes to a meeting;&amp;#160;if you are a direct report to the leader calling the meeting, you attend. Which makes everyone feel compelled to bring something to say. This is how meetings devolve into useless status updates. Worse, under the guise of making people feel &amp;#8220;included,&amp;#8221; meetings balloon into U.N.-like summits with dozens sitting in a room wondering why they are there. The composition of a meeting should be defined by its charter, and only those who have something specific to contribute &amp;#8212; expertise, authority over resources, responsibility to execute &amp;#8212; should be included. Anyone else who has a stake in the meeting outcome should be informed. For example, if a meeting charter has significant implications for finance, one person from finance can attend and keep their colleagues informed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There should also be metrics assessing how well a meeting is executing its charter. For example, if a customer success team composed of sales, customer support, on-site&amp;#160;technical assistance, and engineering is tasked with effectively implementing new technology for customers, then customer complaints, speed of adoption, open ticket time, and overall product satisfaction should be tracked so that the team&amp;#160;&amp;#8212; and its stakeholders&amp;#160;&amp;#8212; know if it&amp;#8217;s contributing as intended.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In my experience, meetings being&amp;#160;ineffective&amp;#160;is often an indicator that &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/03/do-you-really-need-to-hold-that-meeting\"&gt;they shouldn&amp;#8217;t be occurring&lt;/a&gt;. To test this, I ask groups, &amp;#8220;If you stopped meeting, who besides you would care?&amp;#8221; If they struggle to respond, I have my answer. If you want to give your organization a great gift, immediately shut down recurring meetings that don&amp;#8217;t meet these criteria. The cheers will be deafening.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=qReo3Rh87RA:V8dQZoq1VgA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=qReo3Rh87RA:V8dQZoq1VgA:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/harvardbusiness/~4/qReo3Rh87RA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><feedburner:origLink>https://hbr.org/2018/02/how-to-fix-the-most-soul-crushing-meetings</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><title>How Arizona Is Leading the Autonomous Vehicle Revolution - SPONSOR CONTENT FROM ARIZONA COMMERCE AUTHORITY</title><id>tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.193557</id><link href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~r/harvardbusiness/~3/7XQerAZ0lvk/how-arizona-is-leading-the-autonomous-vehicle-revolution\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" /><updated>2018-02-16T18:23:13Z</updated><published>2018-02-15T22:00:11Z</published><summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>Sponsor Content from Arizona Commerce Authority</p>\n]]></summary><category term=\"Automotive\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/industry\" label=\"Automotive\" /><category term=\"Energy &amp; Natural Resources\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/industry\" label=\"Energy &amp; Natural Resources\" /><category term=\"Transportation\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/industry\" label=\"Transportation\" /><category term=\"Sponsor Content\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/contentType\" label=\"Sponsor Content\" /><content type=\"html\" xml:base=\"https://hbr.org/sponsored/2018/02/how-arizona-is-leading-the-autonomous-vehicle-revolution\" xml:lang=\"en\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/1200x627_HBR_AV-feature-image.png\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-194566\" src=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/1200x627_HBR_AV-feature-image-300x157.png\" srcset=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/1200x627_HBR_AV-feature-image-300x157.png 300w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/1200x627_HBR_AV-feature-image-1024x535.png 1024w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/1200x627_HBR_AV-feature-image-383x200.png 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/1200x627_HBR_AV-feature-image-500x261.png 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/1200x627_HBR_AV-feature-image-700x366.png 700w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/1200x627_HBR_AV-feature-image-850x444.png 850w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/1200x627_HBR_AV-feature-image-1200x627.png 1200w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/1200x627_HBR_AV-feature-image.png 1200w\" alt=\"1200x627_HBR_AV feature image\" width=\"1200\" height=\"650\" sizes=\"(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Self-driving vehicles, once a science fiction technology, are rapidly becoming a reality that promises to transform our lives &amp;#8211;&amp;#160; &amp;#160;making it safer and more efficient to move people and goods, while reinventing our thinking about transportation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Arizona, one of the leading cities for autonomous vehicles, is the proving ground for this transformative innovation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This fleet of driverless cars &amp;#8212; 600 Chrysler Pacifica mini-vans, operated by Google&amp;#8217;s Waymo &amp;#8212; can be seen today daily on the streets where companies like GM and Ford also are testing autonomous innovations. Arizona startup Local Motors developed &amp;#8220;Ollie,&amp;#8221; the self-driving bus here. And ride-sharing companies like Lyft and Uber have scaled their operations while deploying their own self-driving vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Under Governor Doug Ducey&amp;#8217;s direction, the state has played a leading role in this dramatic evolution of mobility &amp;#8211; and it&amp;#8217;s done so by getting out of the way. Arizona&amp;#8217;s focus on encouraging innovation, while ensuring public safety, has created an environment where the testing and development of this technology can thrive.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Led by the Arizona Commerce Authority, the state is advancing an economic development strategy focused on the idea that while technological advances are the keys to prosperity, the support of an innovation ecosystem &amp;#173;that includes private industry, state government and academia, is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So as the debate about testing and regulation of driverless cars arose in several other states, in 2015, Governor Ducey stepped forward and signed an executive order instructing state agencies to &amp;#8220;undertake any necessary steps to support the testing and operation of self-driving vehicles on public roads within Arizona.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The state believes that the development of self-driving vehicle technology will promote economic growth, bring new jobs, provide research opportunities for the state&amp;#8217;s academic institutions and their students and faculty, and allow the state to host the emergence of new technologies,&amp;#8221; the order said.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Upon signing the order, the governor announced that Uber would be forming a partnership with the University of Arizona (UA) to support research and development of state-of-the-art lenses and sensors, which help autonomous vehicles navigate.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, UA researchers and the Maricopa County Department of Transportation have received funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation to test new technology in Anthem, Arizona, that connects traffics signals and cars. This will provide real time information about driving obstacles to improve driver safety.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Other industry-leading companies like Ford and GM have also moved their driverless car operations to the state. GM operates an IT Innovation Center in Chandler and the Cruise Automation facility in Scottsdale. Waymo, which partnered with Intel to design, build, and test its autonomous vehicles, is testing its autonomous car fleet on the streets of Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;While testing and research are underway on driverless cars, policymakers also took important steps to explore the impact on community safety and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;For example, they have established the Arizona Self-Driving Vehicle Oversight Committee, a team of transportation, policy, and public safety experts who will help the state conduct research on self-driving technology. The committee will work closely with both the Department of Transportation and the Department of Public Safety, advising the agencies on the safest ways to roll out driverless cars on public roads.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As exploration of these innovations moves rapidly forward, the social and economic impact of this new era of transportation is just beginning to be understood.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;For instance, autonomous vehicles have the potential to dramatically reduce fatalities and increase safety, because they will never drive distracted, tired, or impaired like human drivers. Daily commutes could be more productive for millions of people who now spend their time behind the wheel on the way to work.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;And self-driving cars also hold the promise of increasing mobility and efficiency in transportation. They could also offer new independence for people, young, old, and those with disabilities, who can&amp;#8217;t drive a car. Self-driving cars in ride sharing fleets also have the potential to provide affordable, on-demand transportation for people who cannot afford to own a car, or live in communities with limited transportation options.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;And as car ownership moves from something personal to something people think of as a ride-sharing service, these vehicles have the potential to ease traffic congestion, reduce pollution and have a major impact on transportation infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The potential offshoots of this technology seem almost limitless &amp;#8211; and Arizona&amp;#8217;s commitment to developing this industry has ensured it will have a leading role in creating a new road map for transportation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Learn more at &lt;a href=\"https://www.azcommerce.com/\"&gt;azcommerce.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=7XQerAZ0lvk:x2CcGrRlov0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=7XQerAZ0lvk:x2CcGrRlov0:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/harvardbusiness/~4/7XQerAZ0lvk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><feedburner:origLink>https://hbr.org/sponsored/2018/02/how-arizona-is-leading-the-autonomous-vehicle-revolution</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><title>3 Reasons Global Firms Should Keep Investing in India</title><id>tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.194925</id><link href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~r/harvardbusiness/~3/GFElkTNGaM8/3-reasons-global-firms-should-keep-investing-in-india\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" /><updated>2018-02-16T18:00:10Z</updated><published>2018-02-16T13:05:17Z</published><summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>Infrastructure spending, a strong middle class, and the country&#8217;s tech startups.</p>\n]]></summary><author><name>Vijay Govindarajan</name><uri>https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2013/09/110-vijay-govindarajan.jpg</uri></author><author><name>Ravi Venkatesan</name><uri>https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2014/05/110-Ravi-Venkatesan.jpg</uri></author><category term=\"Emerging markets\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Emerging markets\" /><category term=\"Global strategy\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Global strategy\" /><category term=\"Economic development\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Economic development\" /><category term=\"South Asia\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/geography\" label=\"South Asia\" /><category term=\"Digital Article\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/contentType\" label=\"Digital Article\" /><content type=\"html\" xml:base=\"https://hbr.org/2018/02/3-reasons-global-firms-should-keep-investing-in-india\" xml:lang=\"en\">&lt;div class=\"mbn pbn\"&gt;\r\n&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-194972\" src=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-16-680672058-boris-sv.jpg\" srcset=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-16-680672058-boris-sv-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-16-680672058-boris-sv-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-16-680672058-boris-sv-500x281.jpg 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-16-680672058-boris-sv-383x215.jpg 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-16-680672058-boris-sv-383x215.jpg 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-16-680672058-boris-sv-500x281.jpg 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-16-680672058-boris-sv-700x394.jpg 700w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-16-680672058-boris-sv-850x478.jpg 850w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-16-680672058-boris-sv-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-16-680672058-boris-sv.jpg 1200w\" alt=\"feb18-16-680672058-boris-sv\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" sizes=\"(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit ptn mtn\"&gt;boris sv/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A major debate has unfolded around India&amp;#8217;s economic prospects. On the one hand, you have Prime Minister Modi declaring at the &lt;a href=\"http://www.news18.com/news/opinion/opinion-pm-modi-projected-india-as-a-global-power-ready-for-leadership-in-davos-1643515.html\"&gt;2018 World Economic Forum&lt;/a&gt; that India&amp;#8217;s economy, already the fifth largest in the world, will double, to $5 trillion, by 2025. On the other hand, you have the media &lt;a href=\"https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21734382-multinational-businesses-relying-indian-consumers-face-disappointment-indias-missing-middle\"&gt;pointing out&lt;/a&gt; the country&amp;#8217;s shallow middle class, growing inequality and joblessness, and a trail of multinationals frustrated by the lack of China-like success in India.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;While India remains a&amp;#160;challenging market, there are at least three reasons global firms cannot overlook&amp;#160;the country without consequences.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;India has seen growth in infrastructure spending.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;The country has been increasing its spending on infrastructure such as airports, cities, hotels, ports, roads, bridges, hospitals, and power plants. During the past three years, for instance, the newly formed &lt;a href=\"https://swarajyamag.com/economy/under-chandrababu-naidu-a-new-andhra-is-in-the-works\"&gt;Andhra Pradesh State&lt;/a&gt; has made massive investments in building out its infrastructure.

It&amp;#8217;s been estimated that India needs &lt;a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/india-needs-5-15-trillion-in-infra-by-2030-to-sustain-growth-says-adb/story-vk3OI8UNMU2AmCUx5v2W6K.html\"&gt;$5 trillion&lt;/a&gt; in infrastructure investment to sustain its economic growth, but local Indian companies lack the competencies needed. This means significant growth potential for multinationals who have core competencies in high-tech infrastructure solutions such as jet engines, turbines, CT scanners, and satellite communications.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;India&amp;#8217;s emerging middle class is strong.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#8217;s true that India&amp;#8217;s business environment poses challenges for all companies in the consumer economy. All the same, some global consumer companies, &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Conquering-Chaos-Win-India-Everywhere/dp/1422184307\"&gt;such as Unilever, Xiaomi, Suzuki, Hyundai, Honda, LG, Samsung, and Colgate&lt;/a&gt;, have been able to overcome challenges and constraints to do spectacularly well in the middle of the economic pyramid.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Consider two success stories in India&amp;#8217;s consumer economy: &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/07/how-amazon-adapted-its-business-model-to-india\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and Renault&amp;#8217;s ultra-low-cost &lt;a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/27240398-ffd8-11e4-bc30-00144feabdc0\"&gt;Kwid&lt;/a&gt; car. Amazon entered India in 2013 when two local Indian companies, Flipkart and Snapdeal, had already established themselves as market leaders in e-commerce&amp;#160;&amp;#8212; and still rose to become &lt;a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2016/06/09/why-amazon-is-betting-big-on-india/#17ef85024555\"&gt;the number one online retailer&lt;/a&gt; in India.&amp;#160;The country has added new customers at the fastest rate for Amazon in its history of operations across the world, including the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when Renault entered India and introduced Kwid in 2015, Maruti and Hyundai had almost 70% of India&amp;#8217;s large and fast-growing subcompact car market. In a short two years, Kwid gained &lt;a href=\"http://www.livemint.com/Industry/NxJEMs7Lqgdtx3wJ4CNMVJ/Riding-on-Kwids-success-Renault-to-develop-another-global.html\"&gt;15% of the market&lt;/a&gt;. More important, Renault has taken Kwid to many other markets, including South America.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Three things allow firms like Amazon and Renault to succeed in India&amp;#8217;s consumer market. First, their CEOs have a strategic and long-term commitment to the market. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Renault CEO Carlos Ghosn are in India for the long term, as a hub for middle-of-the-pyramid innovations that can serve all emerging, and even developed, markets. Second, they build strong local teams in India and shift resources and decision-making authority to India. Amazon&amp;#8217;s India CEO Amit Agarwal and Renault&amp;#8217;s India CEO Sumit Sawhney have considerable autonomy to innovate in India. Third, they evolve their business models and make products that are appealing, affordable, and accessible to the emerging middle class. Renault&amp;#8217;s Kwid and Amazon&amp;#8217;s e-commerce model are totally customized for the needs of the Indian middle class.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;For comparison, this is the opposite of what Apple is doing in the world&amp;#8217;s second-largest smartphone market. Apple&amp;#8217;s iPhone has a 2% market share, while Samsung and Xiaomi lead the market with 23% each. One reason why is that Apple seems to be waiting for Indians to get wealthier and fit its business model, while competitors Samsung and Xiaomi are offering products and pricing customized for Indian consumers.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Challenging as India is, the bigger challenge for most global companies is learning to adapt their approaches to other markets rather than copying and pasting their developed market models across the world. To succeed in India, companies must be willing to take a clean sheet of paper and start designing to the middle of the pyramid.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The country is in a tech startup boom&lt;/strong&gt;. The biggest reason why India should continue to matter to global firms is not the size of the market per se&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; but the opportunity to participate in one of the richest tech startup innovation ecosystems in the world. The startup ecosystem, now &lt;a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/research/periodic-table-india-tech-startups/\"&gt;the world&amp;#8217;s third largest&lt;/a&gt;, is maturing rapidly and is no longer dominated by copycat e-commerce companies. In fact, tech startups have attracted over &lt;a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com\"&gt;$20 billion in the past three years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Three factors are driving this boom. The first is India&amp;#8217;s investment in its technology infrastructure. Government agencies and tech volunteers have come together to create &lt;a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliviergarret/2017/06/28/india-is-likely-to-become-the-first-digital-cashless-society/2/#7ea7286edcc4\"&gt;&amp;#8220;India Stack&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#8212; a set of APIs giving governments, businesses, startups, and developers a common digital infrastructure on which they can build and deliver presence-less, paperless, and cashless services. For example, &lt;a href=\"http://www.ril.com/ourbusinesses/jio.aspx\"&gt;telecom companies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.bobibanking.com\"&gt;banks&lt;/a&gt; are now able to open new accounts in five minutes without a single paper document. Digital payments using a free &lt;a href=\"https://www.rbi.org.in\"&gt;API called UPI&lt;/a&gt; (Unified Payment Interface) have already exceeded &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;credit card transactions in little over a year. Internet wireless access has dramatically increased recently, especially after &lt;a href=\"http://www.livemint.com/Industry/lHFD4WXCoWs4BPdiYgdFKJ/Mukesh-Ambanis-army-of-expats-at-Jio.html\"&gt;Reliance Jio&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; 4G rollout (Reliance alone added 160 million new users in a year). &lt;a href=\"http://www.daijiworld.com/news/newsDisplay.aspx?newsID=442948\"&gt;Aadhaar&lt;/a&gt;, a 12-digit unique identity number issued to Indian citizens based on their biometric data, has 1.2 billion enrollees and was used to authenticate 9 billion transactions in 2017. The country has over &lt;a href=\"https://www.idc.com\"&gt;350 million smartphones&lt;/a&gt;, and this number is growing 25% CAGR.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The second factor is India&amp;#8217;s vast number of consumers and its large, highly educated, and young talent base. In sheer numbers, India is hard to beat. India&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_education_in_India\"&gt;10,000 engineering institutes&lt;/a&gt; produce more engineers than China and the U.S. combined, and &lt;a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/interviews/indias-problem-is-to-find-jobs-for-10-12-million-new-workers-every-year-akshay-kothari-linkedin-india/articleshow/53998506.cms\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; adds &lt;a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/interviews/indias-problem-is-to-find-jobs-for-10-12-million-new-workers-every-year-akshay-kothari-linkedin-india/articleshow/53998506.cms%E2%88%9A\"&gt;10&amp;#8211;12 million&lt;/a&gt; youngsters to its workforce every year.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The third factor is that India&amp;#8217;s problems cannot be solved without leveraging technology. For example, India has a huge shortage of hospital beds and medical professionals relative to its population base of 1.2 billion. The education sector similarly suffers from too few teachers and universities. And in the legal system, it might take&amp;#160;&lt;a href=\"http://dakshindia.org\"&gt;30 years to clear the backlog&lt;/a&gt; of pending legal cases. Financial services, education, health care, justice, and several other services can only be delivered by effectively leveraging technology. This means huge opportunities for tech startups in these sectors, and we&amp;#8217;re already seeing innovative tech companies enter the Indian market.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, India is a paradox: mega opportunities and mega headaches. The mega headaches include: bureaucratic rules and regulations, strong labor unions, corruption, underdeveloped institutions, inadequate physical infrastructure, and difficulty in acquiring land. But if a company can overcome the challenges, the prize is huge. We&amp;#8217;ve given several examples of multinationals&amp;#160;that have cracked India&amp;#8217;s code. More should&amp;#160;follow their lead.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=GFElkTNGaM8:1zMV7MVJ0Ro:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=GFElkTNGaM8:1zMV7MVJ0Ro:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/harvardbusiness/~4/GFElkTNGaM8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><feedburner:origLink>https://hbr.org/2018/02/3-reasons-global-firms-should-keep-investing-in-india</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><title>Research: A Strong Privacy Policy Can Save Your Company Millions</title><id>tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.194594</id><link href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~r/harvardbusiness/~3/Bl5ENAULqCA/research-a-strong-privacy-policy-can-save-your-company-millions\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" /><updated>2018-02-15T18:27:44Z</updated><published>2018-02-15T15:00:33Z</published><summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>Here are the Fortune 100 companies with the best and worst policies.</p>\n]]></summary><author><name>Kelly D.

And it isn&amp;#8217;t only violated firms that are hurt by these incidents. Studying hundreds of data breaches, &lt;a href=\"http://journals.ama.org/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.15.0497?code=amma-site\"&gt;our research&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;has found that they create significant ripples that affect other companies in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Our research shows that data breaches sometimes harm a firm&amp;#8217;s close rivals (due to spillover effects), but sometimes help them (due to competitive effects). What is more, we found that a good corporate privacy policy can shield firms from the financial harm posed by a data breach &amp;#8212; by offering customers transparency and control over their personal information &amp;#8212; while a flawed policy can exacerbate the problems caused by a breach. Together, this evidence is the first to show that a firm&amp;#8217;s close rivals are directly, financially affected by its data breach and also to offer actionable solutions that could save some companies hundreds of millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Our research shows that sometimes a breach creates spillover, where investors perceive a guilt-by-association effect that harms the breached firm&amp;#8217;s close rivals. For an example of competitor harm due to these spillover effects, consider the July 2012 Nvidia data breach, which affected 400,000 user accounts. Its rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) lost about $48 million on the event day (-1.4% drop in stock price) from the spillover effects of Nvidia&amp;#8217;s breach, controlling for overall market effects. That is, when removing from our analyses all other events that could have influenced AMD&amp;#8217;s stock drop, such as dividend declarations, contract signings, earnings information, or mergers and acquisitions, we find that clear and significant harm occurred from Nvidia&amp;#8217;s data breach.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, the spillover effects across our sample evidenced a drop in stock price that averaged more than $8 million in losses for rival firms where no such data breach occurred. Our results show the financial hit to these rivals&amp;#8217; stock prices can be detected for several days after the data breach before eventually stabilizing.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yet a breach can sometimes help a close rival, creating beneficial competitive effects. Consider the massive Anthem data breach in February 2015, which affected as many as 80 million customers. The high severity of this breach led rival Aetna to gain about $745 million (2.2% increase in stock prices) on the event day due to competitive effects, again controlling for overall market effects. In this situation, a data breach of this scale makes investors worry about customers mass defecting to competitors, thus providing a positive boost to a close competitor&amp;#8217;s stock price.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Our research shows that the severity of, or number of customers affected by, a breach is a key to understanding whether close rivals will be harmed or helped by their competitor&amp;#8217;s bad fortune. As the number of customers harmed by the breach increases, stock market effects for the firm&amp;#8217;s rivals go from negative to positive, as competitive effects become more dominant. This suggests that smaller breaches signal that others in the industry may also be vulnerable to hacking. However, large data breaches create the impression&amp;#160;that the breached firm is in a unique amount of&amp;#160;trouble. Our research shows that in large data breaches, customers increasingly desire to leave the breached firm. Expected switching behavior ultimately benefits the breached firm&amp;#8217;s competitors, as captured in their stock returns.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The good news is that firms are not powerless against these data breach effects. There are actionable strategies they can use to protect or inoculate themselves from their own or a rival&amp;#8217;s breach. Using studies querying hundreds of customers that we recruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk, coupled with stock data analysis of hundreds of companies over the past decade, our research finds that firms can protect themselves from data breach harm by implementing two important privacy-focused practices that benefit customers.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;First, they can clearly explain to customers how they are using and sharing their data. Transparent privacy practices tell customers what specific information companies capture and how they use it (for example, IP address, search history, promotions, information being sold to third parties). Second, firms can give customers ample control over the use and sharing of their data. Control is endowed through giving customer opportunities to opt out of the firm&amp;#8217;s data practices (promotions, sharing with partners, selling). Together, these measures were perceived to effectively empower customers, giving them greater knowledge and the ability to have a say in business practices.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;article-sidebar class=\"article-sidebar sidebar--half\" data-sidebar-alternate=\"sidebar\"&gt;&lt;h4 class=\"sidebar-title\"&gt;Why Study Privacy Policies?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"sidebar-contents height--collapse\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although companies can provide transparency and control through various customer communications, the formalized and codified ways they do this is their privacy policies. These policies are important customer communication tools because the firm has legally agreed to abide by them. Regardless of what a company might message about data privacy in other ways, what must be put into practice is formally documented in the privacy policy. When customers are in doubt about their personal information, company messaging commonly refers them back to the privacy policy. Finally, a &lt;a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11747-016-0495-4\"&gt;recent review of data privacy research in marketing&lt;/a&gt; found that customers do, in fact, have a good idea of a firm&amp;#8217;s data practices as captured in a firm&amp;#8217;s privacy policy &amp;#8212; even if they do not read the privacy policy. Because privacy policies are simply a documentation of all company privacy practices, customers that are familiar with a given company and its approach to privacy have a highly accurate sense of what is in the policy. Again, our research with hundreds of customers confirmed this knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article-sidebar&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;When a firm had transparent privacy practices, customers in our studies felt they had the knowledge to make an informed decision about sharing their personal data. When a firm&amp;#8217;s privacy practices offered control, customers knew they had the ability to change their preferences about what and how they share their information. In our studies, customers did not punish breached firms that provided both transparency and control. Empowered customers are more willing to share information and are more forgiving of data privacy breaches, remaining loyal after the fact, as we learned. Customers of firms that offer high transparency and control reported feeling less violated from big data practices, attested to being more trusting, provided more-accurate data to the firm, and were more likely to generate positive word of mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Firms high on these two dimensions also were buffered from stock price damage during data breaches, either their own or rivals&amp;#8217;. Yet only about 10% of Fortune 500 firms fit this profile.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To study how a firm implements practices that provide transparency and control, we needed to look at the documented ways in which companies explain their approach to customer data privacy.&amp;#160;By studying their use of transparency and control in their privacy policies, we wanted to understand how protected Fortune 100 firms were from the negative effects of data breaches. Our research team combed the privacy policies of all Fortune 100 firms to gain insights.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"max-width-700\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignleft size-full mvn pvm has-border-top has-border-bottom wp-image-194938\" src=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/W180118_MARTIN_HOWGOOD1.png\" srcset=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/W180118_MARTIN_HOWGOOD1-189x300.png 189w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/W180118_MARTIN_HOWGOOD1-647x1024.png 647w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/W180118_MARTIN_HOWGOOD1-383x606.png 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/W180118_MARTIN_HOWGOOD1-500x792.png 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/W180118_MARTIN_HOWGOOD1-700x1108.png 700w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/W180118_MARTIN_HOWGOOD1-850x1346.png 850w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/W180118_MARTIN_HOWGOOD1-1200x1900.png 1200w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/W180118_MARTIN_HOWGOOD1.png 1401w\" alt=\"W180118_MARTIN_HOWGOOD\" sizes=\"(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw\" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Our findings show that some firms provide high levels of data transparency and control, and would be protected from data breaches. (See our ranking in the exhibit &amp;#8220;How Good Are the Fortune 100&amp;#8217;s Privacy Policies?&amp;#8221;) Top-ranked firms such as Costco, Verizon, and HP would be shielded from spillover effects were a close competitor to experience a data breach. These firms clearly convey what information they capture and how they capture it, while offering their customers substantial control or say in that information&amp;#8217;s sharing and use.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the ranking are firms such as Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and HCA. In 2011 Citigroup experienced a data breach&amp;#160;of 146,000 customer records and suffered a $1.3 billion stock value loss. According to our analysis, if Citigroup had embraced practices of high transparency and high control, it would have suffered a loss of only about $16 million in stock value. That is, Citigroup might have saved about $820 million had it simply offered its customers high transparency and control. In response to this breach, &lt;a href=\"https://www.ponemon.org/blog/2015-cost-of-data-breach-global\"&gt;Citigroup spent $250 million on cybersecurity systems and hired an additional 1,000 IT professionals&lt;/a&gt;. Yet our coding of its practices reveals that, as recently as 2016, Citi still was not providing high levels of transparency and control. Thus, while its enhanced IT safeguards may be sound, our research shows the company remains at risk should a competitor suffer a breach.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;article-sidebar class=\"article-sidebar sidebar--half\" data-sidebar-alternate=\"sidebar\"&gt;&lt;h4 class=\"sidebar-title\"&gt;Company Ranking Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"sidebar-contents height--collapse\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We created &lt;em&gt;transparency&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;control&lt;/em&gt; variables with procedures that employed a mix of automation and manual coding of companies&amp;#8217; actual privacy policies.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;First, we captured all the relevant URLs pertaining to firms&amp;#8217; privacy policies that were in effect on January 1, 2016. We developed a Python code that visited all valid snapshots of each Fortune 500 firm&amp;#8217;s privacy policy to extract that closest to our date of interest. In order to ensure the correct URLs were downloaded and parsed, a manual layer of quality check was performed. Specifically, a random 5% of the URLs were checked to find if there were any errors in the code, and the errors were corrected. We then resampled the URLs and found no errors. This process ensured that we correctly retrieved the privacy policy. Third, after obtaining the relevant privacy policy, we employed manual coding to construct the transparency and control variables, which consisted of carefully reading each privacy policy and using a coding schema to create count scores for transparency and control. For the variables that required coding of events, we followed standard procedures for textual coding.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Specifically, for the textual coding procedure, we employed two research assistants who were blind to the study hypothesis. Prior to coding the privacy policies, the two research assistants were independently trained on a sample of privacy policies (that were not part of the final sample) to use the coding scheme. One of the authors checked to ensure the research assistants understood the coding scheme. After obtaining all the privacy policies, each research assistant independently coded them. Finally, after all the privacy policies were coded, the interrater agreement between the two research assistants was greater than 85%, and all disagreements were resolved through discussion with the first author.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;For the transparency variable, we used a count of the dummy variables across multiple elements of the privacy policy that signal openness and willingness to provide information to customers. Specifically, we coded whether the firm (1) explains its opt-out policy, (2) explains how it captures data, (3) explains how it uses data, (4) explains its use of tracking tools, (5) explains the value customers receive from providing their information, (6) explains its data sharing with third parties, (7) explains its data encryption practices, (8) provides contact information for privacy requests, and (9) discusses protections if data is compromised. If a firm&amp;#8217;s privacy policy had all nine characteristics, the policy earned a transparency score of nine.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To create the control variable, we counted the number of opt-out choices in the firm&amp;#8217;s privacy policy. Specifically, we coded whether the customer can opt out of (1) marketing communications, (2) saving data usage (for example, search history), (3) storing personal information (for example, credit card number), (4) sharing data with third parties, and (5) tracking. If a firm&amp;#8217;s privacy policy had all five characteristics, the policy earned a control score of five. Note that we also counted opt-outs that were not on this list, but that were featured as part of the firm&amp;#8217;s privacy policy. Four firms included additional data collection or data-use opt-outs beyond our five characteristics. These were firm-specific opt-outs that enabled greater customer control, but did not warrant separate opt-out categories for the entire sample of firms.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To create our rankings, we compiled the summed scores of transparency and control for all firms. Rankings were achieved by summing the combined transparency and control scores. It follows that some firms had identical scores on both dimensions, and in such cases they appear according to alphabetical order in the ranking.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article-sidebar&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Looking across the rankings, other firms appear to offer one of these aspects to customers. For example, some firms provide transparency, but fail to give customers the ability to act on this information (low control). In our research, this approach was poorly received by customers.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, firms that neither tell customers how they use their data nor offer any control are at the greatest risk of financial harm. Our privacy analysis showed that an overwhelming 80% of Fortune 500 firms fall into this category. In our study, firms that failed to explain their data privacy practices had a 1.5 times larger drop in stock price than firms with high transparency, while firms that provided customers high control had no significant change in their stock price after a data breach.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, firms can use data privacy practices to protect themselves from the spillover effects of competitors&amp;#8217; privacy failures, but their efforts to do so need to be meaningful. They must clearly explain to customers the ways in which they will access, use, share, and protect customer information, and it must go hand in hand with giving customers control over these data uses. Failure to do so leaves a firm susceptible to risk from multiple harms.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;#8217;s note: Every ranking or index is just one way to analyze and compare companies or places, based on a specific methodology and data set. At HBR, we believe that a well-designed index can provide useful insights, even though by definition it is a snapshot of a bigger picture. We always urge you to read the methodology carefully.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=Bl5ENAULqCA:doENw3br_54:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=Bl5ENAULqCA:doENw3br_54:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/harvardbusiness/~4/Bl5ENAULqCA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><feedburner:origLink>https://hbr.org/2018/02/research-a-strong-privacy-policy-can-save-your-company-millions</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><title>Power Can Corrupt Leaders.

For more than four hours, Stumpf fielded a range of questions about why the bank, which had over $1.8 trillion in assets, had created 2 million false accounts, and, after the fraud was discovered, fired 5,300 employees as a way of redirecting the blame. The recordings of the hearing are a shocking but illustrative case study of how leaders are at risk of being corrupted by power.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Stumpf&amp;#8217;s appearance before Congress shows a man who had made it to the top of one of the world&amp;#8217;s most valuable banks &amp;#8212; and who seems to show an utter lack of ability to have compassion for other people. Even though his actions caused&amp;#160;5,300 people to lose their jobs, he seemed incapable of acknowledging their pain. Yes, he apologized, but he didn&amp;#8217;t seem remorseful. Rather, he seemed a little taken aback by the whole thing, as if he really didn&amp;#8217;t understand what all the fuss was about.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The behavior of John Stumpf can be explained through the &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23815455\"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; of neuroscientist Sukhvinder Obhi, who has found that power impairs our mirror-neurological activity &amp;#8212; the neurological function that indicates the ability to understand and associate with others. David Owen, a British physician and parliamentarian, has dubbed this phenomenon&amp;#160;&lt;a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/132/5/1396/354862\"&gt;hubris syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, which he defines as a &amp;#8220;disorder of the possession of power, particularly power which has been associated with overwhelming success, held for a period of years.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;One CEO we interviewed for our upcoming book was very open about this problem. For more than a decade, he had been the CEO of a large global consumer goods brand, but as time went on, the constant pressure, the heady activity of crafting a strategy, and the need to make tough decisions with tough implications for others had made him less empathetic. He found himself pulling back in his relationships with his colleagues, his friends, and even his children, which was against his nature. Empathy used to be a dominant trait of his personality. He used to know how others felt, and he could naturally demonstrate concern for their feelings. But his leadership role had taken a toll, and eventually, empathy was all but absent from his thinking and decision making. He was matter-of-fact about this when he told us, but remorseful, too.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Through our interviews, we heard variations of this time and again. It&amp;#8217;s not that power makes people want to be less empathetic; it&amp;#8217;s that taking on greater responsibilities and pressure can rewire our brains and, through no fault of our own, force us to stop caring about other people as much as we used to. But it does not have to be this way. Such rewiring can be avoided &amp;#8212; and it can also be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Compassion is the key. While empathy is the tendency to feel others&amp;#8217; emotions and take them on as if you were feeling them, compassion is the &lt;em&gt;intent &lt;/em&gt;to contribute to the happiness and well-being of others. Compassion, therefore, is more proactive, which means we can make a habit of it. By doing so, we can counter the loss of empathy that results from holding power, and in turn enable better leadership and human connections at work.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Of the over&amp;#160;1,000 leaders we surveyed, 91% said compassion is very important for leadership, and 80% would like to enhance their compassion but do not know how. Compassion is clearly a hugely overlooked skill in leadership training.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Based on our work with thousands of leaders, here are a few practical ways&amp;#160;to enhance your compassion:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Apply Compassion to Any Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A Chinese proverb says, &amp;#8220;There is no way to compassion; compassion is the way.&amp;#8221; Bringing compassion into any interaction you have and asking how you can be of benefit to others is the way to compassion. Compassion is something we create by applying it to every interaction we have.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In that way, it can become the compass that directs your intentions, attention, and actions. Whenever you engage with someone, ask yourself: &amp;#8220;How can I be of benefit to this person?&amp;#8221; Ask yourself this every time you meet clients, stakeholders, colleagues, family, or friends. Let it be a mantra that drives your intentions, moment by moment, in meeting after meeting.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Seek Opportunities to Show Compassion&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;John Chambers, the former CEO of Cisco, knew that compassion was more than the right thing to do &amp;#8212; it also had a positive impact on his organization. He set up a system to ensure he was informed within&amp;#160;48 hours of any employee, anywhere in the world, experiencing a severe loss or illness. Once notified, he would personally write a letter and extend his support to that person. In this way, he instilled a top-down appreciation of the value of care and compassion throughout the company.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Whether you are the CEO or not, make a daily habit of looking for opportunities to show compassion for someone in need of it. If useful, put a reminder in your calendar.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Do a Daily Compassion Meditation&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Compassion can be&amp;#160;cultivated through a number of time-tested practices. &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21840289\"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has found that just a few minutes of practice a day will help your brain rewire itself for increased compassion and that with regular training, you can experience increased positive emotions, increased mindfulness, a stronger sense of purpose, and increased happiness. Also, &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22661409\"&gt;compassion training&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to significantly alter the neural networks of our brain in such a way that we react to the suffering of others with spontaneous compassion, instead of distress and despair.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;a href=\"http://www.potentialproject.com/hbr-compassion/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;to access more resources on compassion training, or simply follow&amp;#160;the instructions below:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Set a timer for four minutes.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Sit comfortably, relax, and focus your attention on your breath to let your mind settle.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;When you have centered yourself, recall a person dear to you, someone who is experiencing challenges.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Be clearly aware of the challenges and how it must feel for the person experiencing them.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;With each exhale, imagine you breathe out everything this person needs: warmth, strength, and compassion. Breathe out everything that is positive and imagine it entering the other person.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;While you continue breathing compassion on each exhale, with each inhale, imagine removing all suffering, pain, regret, and hurt from the person &amp;#8212; but without you taking it on. Imagine that you&amp;#8217;re simply removing their pain.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;When you&amp;#8217;re ready, let go of the person and return your attention to your breath.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;When you&amp;#8217;re ready, let go of the practice and notice how you feel.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=j8mEbmvZ7es:t2YyXP_dRL0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=j8mEbmvZ7es:t2YyXP_dRL0:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/harvardbusiness/~4/j8mEbmvZ7es\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><feedburner:origLink>https://hbr.org/2018/02/power-can-corrupt-leaders-compassion-can-save-them</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><title>Big Companies Are Embracing Analytics, But Most Still Don\u2019t Have a Data-Driven Culture</title><id>tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.194639</id><link href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~r/harvardbusiness/~3/4GBcaOsDYQE/big-companies-are-embracing-analytics-but-most-still-dont-have-a-data-driven-culture\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" /><updated>2018-02-15T13:05:44Z</updated><published>2018-02-15T13:05:44Z</published><summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>According to a new survey.</p>\n]]></summary><author><name>Thomas H.

Each year the response rate increases, and the reported urgency of making effective use of data increases as well. This year the results are both more encouraging and more worrisome than in the past.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Six years ago, the primary focus of questions and answers in the survey was big data, which was relatively new on the business scene. In the 2018 survey, the primary attention has moved to artificial intelligence. AI is now a well-established focus at these large, sophisticated firms. There is both a stronger feeling that big data and AI projects deliver value and a greater concern that established firms will be disrupted by startups.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The survey includes senior executives from 57 large corporations. The industry group with the most firms represented in the survey is one of the most data-intensive: financial services. Companies from the life sciences, manufacturing, telecom, and online industries also participated. The actual respondents are changing somewhat from the first surveys:&amp;#160;It has always involved a high proportion of C-level executives responsible for data, but this year chief data officers&amp;#160;are 56% of the respondents, up from 32% last year. Only 12% of firms in the 2012 survey had even appointed a chief data officer.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;While AI gets the headlines here and elsewhere in the world, the survey addresses both big data and AI. Terminology comes and goes, but the constant is a data explosion and the need to make sense of it. Big data and AI projects have become virtually indistinguishable, particularly given that machine learning is one of the most popular techniques for dealing with large volumes of fast-moving data. It&amp;#8217;s also the case that statistical approaches to AI &amp;#8212; deep learning, for example &amp;#8212; are increasingly popular. Therefore, we view traditional data analytics, big data, and AI as being on a continuum. Virtually all of the respondents (97%) say they are investing in these types of projects.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best news in this survey is that companies continue to believe they are getting value from their big data and AI projects. 73% of respondents said they have already received measurable value from these initiatives. That number is half again higher than in the 2017 survey, which suggests that more value is being achieved as companies grow familiar with the technologies.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The types of value received are perhaps consistent with other previous types of technology. Consistent with our view that big data and AI are extensions of analytical capabilities, the most common objectives &amp;#8212; and those most likely to achieve success &amp;#8212; are &amp;#8220;advanced analytics/better decisions.&amp;#8221; Thirty-six percent had that as their top priority, and 69% of those had already achieved success with the objective. Better customer service and expense reduction are also common objectives. Just over one-quarter of firms (27%) are pursuing some combination of innovation and disruption, speed to market, or data monetization initiatives. Data monetization programs had the lowest priority and the lowest percentage of success (27%).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest issues for concern in the survey for large enterprises is the risk of disruption from new entrants. Almost four in five respondents said they feared disruption or displacement from firms like those in the fintech sector or firms specializing in big data. The technology judged most disruptive is AI &amp;#8212; by far. Seventy-two percent chose it as the disruptive technology with the most impact &amp;#8212; far more than cloud computing (13%) or blockchain (7%).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Another important and continuing issue is the slow speed with which these established firms make the shift to a data-driven culture. Virtually all respondents (99%) say their firms are trying to move in that direction, but only about one-third have succeeded at this objective. This gap appears every year in the surveys, and the level of success hasn&amp;#8217;t improved much over time. Clearly firms need more-concerted programs to achieve data-related cultural change. Many startups have created data-driven cultures from their beginning, which is a key reason why large, established firms fear disruption from them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;One of the approaches that firms have established to deal with data-driven disruption and change is to establish new management roles. However, there is still a lack of clarity about how different data-oriented roles (chief information officer, chief data officer, chief digital officer, chief analytics officer, etc.) relate to each other.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;With respect to the chief data officer role, there is substantial disagreement about the major responsibilities of the role and what types of backgrounds are appropriate for CDO jobs. Thirty-nine percent say their CDO has primary responsibility for data strategy and results, but 37% assign that responsibility to other C-level executives, and 24% say there is no single point of accountability for it. In terms of backgrounds, 34% of respondents believe the CDO should be a change agent from outside the company, while 32% believe the person should be a company veteran from inside the firm. Role clarity in senior data-related roles is critical for both leading AI/big data projects and accomplishing cultural change. And while all respondents believed it important, the majority of firms still lack an enterprise data strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This continuing rise in the importance and challenges of big data is one of the most important features of contemporary economy and society. The survey results over time provide interesting and useful documentation of this revolution. The rise of AI is only exacerbating this trend. The keys to success are to determine how your firm should respond, assign clear responsibilities for data strategy and results, and then move ahead to execute the needed changes in a systematic and effective fashion.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=4GBcaOsDYQE:IesnOXjZotM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=4GBcaOsDYQE:IesnOXjZotM:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/harvardbusiness/~4/4GBcaOsDYQE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><feedburner:origLink>https://hbr.org/2018/02/big-companies-are-embracing-analytics-but-most-still-dont-have-a-data-driven-culture</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><title>Study: Replying to Customer Reviews Results in Better Ratings</title><id>tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.194491</id><link href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~r/harvardbusiness/~3/tOzGk89D-Wc/study-replying-to-customer-reviews-results-in-better-ratings\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" /><updated>2018-02-14T16:35:04Z</updated><published>2018-02-14T15:00:54Z</published><summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>An analysis of&#160;tens of thousands of hotel reviews on TripAdvisor.</p>\n]]></summary><author><name>Davide Proserpio</name><uri>https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/110-Davide-roserpio.jpg</uri></author><author><name>Giorgos Zervas</name></author><category term=\"Customers\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Customers\" /><category term=\"Internet\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Internet\" /><category term=\"Digital Article\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/contentType\" label=\"Digital Article\" /><content type=\"html\" xml:base=\"https://hbr.org/2018/02/study-replying-to-customer-reviews-results-in-better-ratings\" xml:lang=\"en\">&lt;div class=\"mbn pbn\"&gt;\r\n&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-14-tlp918866-john-swope-life.jpg.jpg\" sizes=\"(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw\" srcset=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-14-tlp918866-john-swope-life.jpg-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-14-tlp918866-john-swope-life.jpg-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-14-tlp918866-john-swope-life.jpg-500x281.jpg 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-14-tlp918866-john-swope-life.jpg-383x215.jpg 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-14-tlp918866-john-swope-life.jpg-383x215.jpg 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-14-tlp918866-john-swope-life.jpg-500x281.jpg 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-14-tlp918866-john-swope-life.jpg-700x394.jpg 700w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-14-tlp918866-john-swope-life.jpg-850x478.jpg 850w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-14-tlp918866-john-swope-life.jpg-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-14-tlp918866-john-swope-life.jpg.jpg 1200w\" alt=\"feb18-14-tlp918866-john-swope-life.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-194695\" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit ptn mtn\"&gt;hbr staff/john swope/life/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Every now and then, firms make mistakes that leave their customers unsatisfied: a restaurant misplaces an order, a hotel&amp;#8217;s air conditioning breaks down, or a dry cleaner damages a garment. With increasing frequency, disappointed customers share these negative experiences by writing online reviews, and many potential customers take these reviews into account when making choices about which firms to frequent. Because of this, even small service failures can have a lasting negative impact on a firm&amp;#8217;s reputation &amp;#8212; and financial performance.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In the age of consumer reviews and digital word-of-mouth, how can a firm participate in shaping its online reputation? There are standard service recovery strategies, such as offering perks and discounts to disappointed customers. Many managers have also started publicly responding to consumer reviews as a way to apologize and outline steps the firm has taken to avoid future service failures. Review platforms claim that responding to reviews is good practice, and even provide guidelines for responding (&lt;a href=\"https://www.tripadvisorsupport.com/hc/en-us/articles/200614337-Management-Response-Guidelines\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;here are TripAdvisor&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt;, for example). But does it improve a firm&amp;#8217;s online reputation?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, we examined tens of thousands of hotel reviews and responses from TripAdvisor, which uses a review scale from 1 (terrible) to 5 (excellent). On TripAdvisor, management responses are common: Roughly one-third of reviews receive a response, and nearly half of all hotels respond to reviews. By analyzing these responses, we found that when hotels start responding, they receive 12% more reviews and their ratings increase, on average, by 0.12 stars. While these gains may seem modest, TripAdvisor rounds average ratings to the nearest half star: A hotel with a rating of 4.26 stars will be rounded up to a 4.5, while a hotel with 4.24 stars will be rounded down to a 4. Therefore, even small changes can have a significant impact on consumers&amp;#8217; perceptions. Approximately one-third of the hotels we studied increased their rounded ratings by half a star or more within six months of their first management response.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Digging deeper, we wanted to understand why hotels get more and better reviews when they start responding. For example, if managers are more likely to respond when hotels renovate, we may associate better ratings with responses when they are actually the direct result of improved hotel quality.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To establish a causal link between responses and improved ratings, we exploited the&amp;#160;fact that&amp;#160;although nearly all hotels in our data were reviewed on both TripAdvisor and Expedia, the vast majority of them responded only to their TripAdvisor reviews. This allowed us to use Expedia ratings as a control group. What we found is that when hotels started responding on TripAdvisor, their TripAdvisor ratings went up, but their Expedia ratings remained unchanged. If hotels had made improvements &amp;#8212; unobserved to us &amp;#8212; at the time they started responding, we would have expected to see Expedia ratings improve as well.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This analysis increased our confidence that the&amp;#160;improvement in ratings was a consequence of hotels&amp;#8217; responding. However, we could not yet rule out one final scenario that would have produced the same patterns in the data, even if management responses had no effect on ratings: What if hotels made improvements specifically tailored to the preferences of TripAdvisor users at the time they started responding to TripAdvisor reviews? In that case, we would see TripAdvisor ratings improve relative to Expedia ratings, even if management responses had no effect.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To rule out this alternative explanation, we relied on a frequent pattern we discovered in our TripAdvisor data.&amp;#160;Picture two travelers, Alice and Rodrigo, who stay at the same hotel at the same time. One week later Alice leaves a review on TripAdvisor. Two weeks later Rodrigo also leaves a review. But in the time between the two reviews, the hotel starts responding. Therefore, while Alice and Rodrigo stayed at the same hotel at the same time, only Rodrigo was exposed to previous management responses before leaving his review. Comparing the ratings of all users like Alice and Rodrigo, we found the same effect: Ratings by users who were exposed to management responses were approximately 0.1 stars higher than ratings by those who were not.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, these analyses suggested that improved ratings can be directly linked to management responses. And, perhaps surprisingly, we also found that when managers respond to positive reviews, it has the same benefits as when they respond to negative reviews.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To understand why, imagine visiting your favorite restaurant, where the service and food have always been impeccable &amp;#8212; except this time your main course arrives late. You&amp;#8217;re annoyed and point this out to your dinner companions. Seconds later, the restaurant manager checks in with your party and asks, &amp;#8220;How is everything?&amp;#8221; For a moment, you consider complaining, but instead choose to avoid confrontation and focus on enjoying the rest of your meal. Why did you complain to your dinner companions but not the restaurant manager?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A consumer who is considering complaining on TripAdvisor may face a similar choice. If the consumer notices a manager responding to past reviews, they might decide not to leave a trivial or unsubstantiated negative review, to avoid a potentially uncomfortable online interaction with the manager. Even though reviewers don&amp;#8217;t have to meet the manager in person, an online interaction between the two parties is permanently recorded and available for anyone to read in the future. To avoid situations like this, some consumers might choose not to leave a negative review.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In our analysis, we used the length of the reviews as a proxy for trivial (short) and detailed (long) reviews. We found that consumers who had read past management responses were less likely to leave short reviews than consumers who had not. Consequently, once hotels started responding, they experienced a sharp drop in the rate of short negative reviews. And while longer negative reviews still cropped up, these reviews often contained constructive feedback that could be useful to managers trying to make changes.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The rise of review platforms has left firms with a diminished sense of control over their online reputations, leading to questionable practices such as soliciting positive reviews in exchange for perks &amp;#8212; or even writing fake reviews. While negative reviews are unavoidable, our work shows that managers can actively participate in shaping their firms&amp;#8217; online reputations. By monitoring and responding to reviews, a manager can make sure that when negative reviews come in &amp;#8212; as they inevitably will &amp;#8212; they can respond constructively and maybe even raise their firm&amp;#8217;s rating along the way.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=tOzGk89D-Wc:KzC2T7QTark:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=tOzGk89D-Wc:KzC2T7QTark:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/harvardbusiness/~4/tOzGk89D-Wc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><feedburner:origLink>https://hbr.org/2018/02/study-replying-to-customer-reviews-results-in-better-ratings</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><title>The Future of MBA Education</title><id>tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.194806</id><link href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~r/harvardbusiness/~3/Kk5WyT6GG5s/the-future-of-mba-education\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" /><updated>2018-02-14T20:23:26Z</updated><published>2018-02-14T19:50:07Z</published><summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>Scott DeRue, the dean of University of Michigan&#8217;s Ross School of Business, says the old model of business school education is gone.

Hire a more digitally savvy workforce and force them to move at lightning speed? Maybe. But the first step&amp;#8212;and the most important&amp;#8212;is to look closely at, and invest in, the human capital you already have.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Call it a &amp;#8220;leave no one behind&amp;#8221; strategy. If it sounds drastic, it is&amp;#8212;for the future of your company. Your employees probably don&amp;#8217;t have the skill sets they&amp;#8217;ll need to successfully take on the digital and technological change ahead&amp;#8212;change that is ever evolving.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You could have the best strategy and the latest technologies, but you can&amp;#8217;t execute if your people lack the right digital skills. As it stands, 84 percent of CEOs are concerned about the pace of technological change; 76 percent are concerned about the availability of key skills among employees.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change Your Mindset About Your Workforce&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N8654.276973HARVARDBUSINESSREVIE/B20674363.213692882;dc_trk_aid=413442035;dc_trk_cid=97794516;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=\"&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll need to change your organizational capabilities in order to thrive in an environment where change is the only constant&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s nerve-wracking, frightening, anxiety-inducing. You&amp;#8217;re not the only executive feeling that way. That&amp;#8217;s why it&amp;#8217;s imperative to step up and build the capability to innovate and be agile across the entire enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To do that, begin to shift your thinking. Don&amp;#8217;t focus on hiring people who have cutting-edge skills; instead, develop a &amp;#8220;no man or woman left behind&amp;#8221; philosophy. Start by preparing your workforce by filling in tangible skills gaps, extending their knowledge of all parts of the organization, changing their mindsets, and creating new ways of working.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Purposeful, Not Trendy &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Determine what skills your employees need and how you&amp;#8217;re going to deliver them. Look beyond technology itself. Yes, employees might need training in data analytics and coding, but they also need to learn design thinking, empathy mapping, and how to turn data into insights. From accountants to retail analysts to supply chain experts, functional specialists will need to know how to prepare and contextualize data.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Assess where your people are now, compared with where they&amp;#8217;ll need to be. You&amp;#8217;ll probably need to implement behavioral and structural changes, not just fill in skills. Start with yourself and your leadership team. Employees need to see senior leaders make the transition first.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hire for Gaps, Not Buzzwords&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N8654.276973HARVARDBUSINESSREVIE/B20674363.213692882;dc_trk_aid=413442035;dc_trk_cid=97794516;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=\"&gt;While you&amp;#8217;re reskilling your current workforce&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;#8217;ll inevitably be hiring new talent. Don&amp;#8217;t simply hire people who seem digitally savvy.&amp;#160;You&amp;#8217;ve determined what workforce skills you need to thrive in the future. You&amp;#8217;ll get some of that from your reskilling efforts. But there will still be gaps.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself: Am I missing creative, design, and ethnography skills&amp;#8212;which will be valuable to making AI human-friendly? Do I have employees who are skilled in blockchain? What about solution architects who can balance creative thinking with practical technology? You need such experts to weave together the fabric of your new way of working.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fight Through Discomfort for a New Culture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, you need to ensure you&amp;#8217;re building a culture that supports the type of digital transformation you want to achieve. That means breaking down silos and not letting hierarchies get in the way of solving problems. Your senior leadership team needs to model a thinking process that is faster and more agile, with decisions made more quickly. To do that, you&amp;#8217;ll have to&amp;#8212;perhaps uncomfortably so at first&amp;#8212;embrace new ways of working.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#8217;t just about creating a better way for the employees you have.

At the same time, health insurance premiums have increased as much as 60% in the individual market in some states. The federal and state insurance exchanges have failed to rein in costs. Now, with the rollback of the mandate that individuals must purchase health insurance, the number of uninsured in the country will climb. Meanwhile, continued federal funding of the subsidy for insurance for the poor is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s time for a better idea that addresses both cost and quality. That better idea is expanding the successful Medicare Advantage program to both Medicaid and employer-covered populations.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This Medicare program has a proven track record in preserving quality and generating customer satisfaction. If all Americans were covered by the program, selection bias &amp;#8212;&amp;#160;insurers seeking to cover healthier, more profitable people and shun the sicker and more expensive&amp;#160;&amp;#8212; would be eliminated (since everyone is in the same risk pool).&amp;#160;And health care costs would be better managed because the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) would accelerate value-based payments to providers and cost shifting from Medicare-covered populations to populations covered by&amp;#160;employer-sponsored commercial insurance&amp;#160;plans would be eliminated. (Because Medicare and Medicaid underpay providers and don&amp;#8217;t cover the full costs of treating their populations, commercial plans are forced to pay more than their fair share to cover this shortfall.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Before going into the details of how this approach would work, let&amp;#8217;s first understand the problems that need to be solved.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The&amp;#160;reasons health care costs&amp;#160;are out of control are many, but there are two important ones. Let&amp;#8217;s start with the insurance problem. The Medicare and Medicaid programs underfund the cost of care in most of America. A few states, because of quirks in the Medicare&amp;#160;law of 1965, fare better than others. Regional prices were based on what the existing costs were in various markets when the law went into effect in 1966, adjusted by cost of living for those communities. From the beginning, if a hospital was efficient in a low-cost market, the Medicare payments were much lower than those made to high-cost inefficient hospitals in high-cost markets.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This problem has not been addressed in over 50 years because high-cost inefficient markets happen to be in states with large populations and political clout such as New Jersey, New York, and Florida. The legislators from those states would not win reelection if they voted to redistribute payments fairly. This is one reason cost shifting from government payers to commercial payers is even greater in states such as Iowa and Wisconsin. It makes a difference when a hospital in Iowa is paid by CMS as little as 50% of one in New Jersey. But even in New Jersey, Medicare is the second-worst payer after Medicaid, so there is still cost shifting. This cost shifting is a never-ending game that employers have rightfully been complaining about for many years.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Accountable care organizations, a prominent feature of the Affordable Care Act (known as&amp;#160;Obamacare), are making the matter worse. They&amp;#160;are aggregations of hospitals, doctors, home care agencies, and other care-delivery components. Medicare contracts with these entities to deliver coordinated care for the Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries, which has led to the mergers of many delivery systems. Few independent hospitals or physician groups are left, and there is no competition in some markets. The consequence is the bigger delivery systems have more leverage in negotiating prices in the commercial marketplace. Evidence suggests that the resulting &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/upshot/us-health-care-expensive-country-comparison.html\"&gt;high prices are a major contributor&lt;/a&gt; to increases in the overall cost of U.S. health care. (There is no evidence, however, that bigger means higher-quality, more-efficient care.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The other important problem is perverse financial incentives. Hundreds of thousands of deaths occur in hospitals and outpatient settings every year due to &lt;a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/353/bmj.i2139\"&gt;medical error&lt;/a&gt;. On top of that, millions of people are injured. But the financial incentives actually reward the errors. Commercial insurers continue to pay for mistakes and poor care by paying providers based on utilization of procedures and hospital admissions, no matter what the reason for service is. This is called fee for service, and it&amp;#8217;s literally killing us.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;CMS has made some inroads in &lt;a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/Value-Based-Programs/Value-Based-Programs.html\"&gt;changing the fee-for-service model&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;and moving toward a pay-for-value model by applying penalties for hospitals that have high error rates. Hospitals that have more acquired infections during a patient hospital stay, for example, get paid less than hospitals that have low infection rates. Hospitals also get docked for patients readmitted&amp;#160;within 30 days of their last hospitalization. (The Trump administration has diluted some pay-for-value programs &lt;a href=\"http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20171130/NEWS/171139986\"&gt;such as the bundled-payment initiative&lt;/a&gt;, but for the most part, CMS is continuing to roll out these programs.) As these value-based payments become part of the mainstream, it is forcing health care systems to utilize principles of enterprise excellence, which require daily frontline problem solving and constant prioritization of projects by leadership to improve the cost and quality of care.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, value-based payments are not reaching many of the large self-funded employers. They simply contract with national plans that continue to pay on a fee-for-service platform, encouraging more utilization of expensive hospitals and outpatient surgery centers, not better health outcomes. Some self-funded employers have taken steps to reduce costs such as establishing on-site clinics and instituting incentives for healthy behaviors. And some companies such as Serigraph in Wisconsin have found that giving employees control over&amp;#160;&amp;#8212; and responsibility for&amp;#160;&amp;#8212; their health care spending&amp;#160;with high-deductible health insurance can save the company money. Most employers, however, are not so aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;What is an alternative to this mess? One idea is to look to a program that has been working: the &lt;a href=\"https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/medicare-health-plans/medicare-advantage-plans/medicare-advantage-plans.html\"&gt;Medicare Advantage program&lt;/a&gt;. It has grown rapidly and now covers more than 30% of all Medicare beneficiaries. It also has one of the highest customer satisfaction rates of any health insurance plan. The dominant type of plan in the program has a health maintenance organization,&amp;#160;or HMO, format and is administered by commercial insurers, who compete on the basis of service, provider networks, and quality. The important pay-for-value features CMS has introduced are embedded in the program. Commercial insurers contract with CMS and are generally satisfied with the financial arrangement and contract processes.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The program should replace both state Medicaid programs and populations currently covered by employers.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medicaid.&lt;/strong&gt; CMS would continue to assure that participating health plans that now cover Medicaid and employer populations meet the stringent quality requirements already established for existing Medicare Advantage plans. It&amp;#8217;s no secret that Medicaid, which is administered completely differently in each of the 50 states, has out-of-control costs and low provider participation. Rolling Medicaid into Medicare Advantage would create a single standard for the plan and increase provider participation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employers.&lt;/strong&gt; All employers with whom I have talked see their health insurance costs as a big risk to their business. But they are concerned about giving up control over administering their own health care benefit plan. I believe if they were given a proven, reasonable alternative to administer benefits and control health care costs, they would change.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s how Medicare Advantage could be structured for employers: Employers would pay a payroll tax. It would be capped and would need to be less than the average of the percentage of payroll that employers currently pay for commercial insurance. A tax starting somewhere at 20% to 21% of the total payroll bill would save most employers a lot of money. (Even the companies that do a good job of managing health care spending still pay upward of 25% of their payrolls for health insurance.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The employer could offer different Medicare Advantage plans through either public or private exchanges. The employer would pay into a pool administered specifically for Medicare Advantage. Or&amp;#160;it could contract directly with insurers to offer plans. This might be advantageous for employers who want to offer the same plan at multiple business sites across the country.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;What are some of the ramifications of this approach? The infusion of new dollars would provide the answer to the Medicare insolvency problem and, at the same time, stabilize employers&amp;#8217; health care costs. The federal government would negotiate prices for implants, devices, and drugs, which would reduce the wild variation in prices. There would be one ultimate contractor (CMS), thereby significantly reducing administrative expenses. Pricing throughout the markets in the United States would be standardized based on current differences in regional costs, not what was happening in the mid-1960s. Difference in payments for Medicare and non-Medicare&amp;#160;treatments would be eliminated, bringing many providers back into the market for former Medicaid patients. Importantly, the government could move the nation away from fee for service faster by building incentive systems that allow providers to focus on improving health and reducing utilization of hospital and other expensive services.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The monopolization of providers in some markets would become irrelevant because the government would establish a standard pricing system. Providers in markets where there are monopolies might get paid less, but they are significantly overpaid today. Provider mergers would happen for the right reasons (to improve the patient experience and health outcomes),&amp;#160;rather than&amp;#160;the wrong&amp;#160;ones (to&amp;#160;create behemoths that wield huge pricing power).&amp;#160;Accountable care organizations could still compete as broad networks of providers, but they would be competing on the right factors, such as quality and service, rather than price, since&amp;#160;that&amp;#160;would be preestablished. Commercial insurers would be able to compete on service, quality, and provider networks and maintain reasonable profit margins.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The main argument against Medicare Advantage for all is it may reduce patient choice. It is true that insurers create networks of providers for their Medicare Advantage offerings that don&amp;#8217;t include every doctor or hospital in America. But the rapid growth of this product in the market and the high consumer satisfaction it has garnered suggest most Medicare beneficiaries are getting their needs met.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Any improvement in the cost and quality of care will require patient involvement: We know that as much as 70% of health care costs are driven by life style choices. CMS has not built incentives into the present Medicare Advantage plans for beneficiaries to make good personal choices, but it should &amp;#8212; and by using&amp;#160;carrots, not sticks. When I was CEO of an integrated delivery system in Wisconsin, we had a single health plan premium price with a 25% employee match. This match could be lowered significantly if employees stopped smoking, lost weight, or better managed their chronic disease&amp;#160;(for example, high blood pressure&amp;#160;or diabetes).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The new system I am proposing would not be that big of a stretch for providers.&amp;#160;They currently receive close to 60% of revenue from government sources. And a recent survey by the American Medical Association suggests that &lt;a href=\"https://khn.org/news/doctors-warm-to-single-payer-health-care/\"&gt;58% of physicians in the country would support&lt;/a&gt; such a government-paid system.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I do not think health care will reform itself. A bold new experiment beyond Obamacare is required, or we will simply revert to having 50 million uninsured people in this country and drastically rising commercial premiums for the rest of us. None of us can afford that.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=4mEQYB8Dz9c:HSC6XbROK4c:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=4mEQYB8Dz9c:HSC6XbROK4c:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/harvardbusiness/~4/4mEQYB8Dz9c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><feedburner:origLink>https://hbr.org/2018/02/one-relatively-easy-way-to-improve-u-s-health-care-expand-medicare-advantage</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><title>Whiteboard Session: This Is Your Brain on Mindfulness</title><id>tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.194803</id><link href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~r/harvardbusiness/~3/ZZSLp09Q66E/whiteboard-session-this-is-your-brain-on-mindfulness\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" /><updated>2018-02-14T20:20:17Z</updated><published>2018-02-14T19:04:52Z</published><summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>Daniel Goleman and Richard Davidson show how it can improve resilience.</p>\n]]></summary><author><name>Daniel Goleman</name></author><author><name>Richard J.

This is especially true in hotly contested markets where fast growth can be the difference between success or failure. And yet this outside funding may come with strings attached, which can (and perhaps should) give entrepreneurs pause. Founders&amp;#160;will likely&amp;#160;find their influence diluted, in terms of both financial&amp;#160;equity and their control over the board of directors. They may even find&amp;#160;themselves out of a job if their investors decide to fire them and find a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Between 20% and 40% of founders do not remain in their original role (&lt;a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sej.1203/full\"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/tc/accept?origin=/stable/pdf/20487964.pdf\"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4135157?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\"&gt;academic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/tc/accept?origin=/stable/pdf/2697837.pdf\"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt;), typically replaced by a more-seasoned executive who might seem better positioned to scale the company and prepare it for the acquisition or IPO market. One would assume venture capitalists are rational actors who would not replace founders if it were not in the best interest of the company&amp;#160;&amp;#8212; at least in terms of its ability to&amp;#160;go public or be acquired &amp;#8212; but it could also be the case that&amp;#160;VCs overestimate the importance of their own role in &lt;a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2697837.pdf\"&gt;&amp;#8220;professionalizing&amp;#8221; the company&lt;/a&gt;. When founders are replaced, how do their startups fare?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To&amp;#160;explore this question, we assembled data from Venturesource, which tracks rounds of funding by venture capitalists, and hand-collected employment histories of founders for startups founded between 1995 and 2008, including how their initial roles changed over time. This data lets us see when founders are replaced. (When a new executive joins the company with the title that a founder used to have, we assume the founder&amp;#160;has been replaced.) We then checked whether the founder stayed at the company (usually in a diminished role) or left following replacement. We followed these companies through the summer of 2017 to ascertain the connection between founder replacement and startup performance.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/rfs/advance-article/doi/10.1093/rfs/hhx130/4604800\"&gt;We found&lt;/a&gt; that approximately one-fifth of founders in venture-backed companies are replaced, which roughly matches findings by other studies, and is roughly similar to replacement rates in public companies. Replacements become more common as the startup ages and investors have time to assess the performance of the founder(s), and replacement rates seem consistent across various types of VCs. As a next step, we correlated replacement with whether the startup achieves an IPO or an &amp;#8220;attractive&amp;#8221; exit, defined as the company being sold for more than 150% of capital raised.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;At a first glance, it might appear that founder replacement drives poorer performance, as those startups where at least one founder was replaced have worse outcomes. However, this result may be because underperforming startups are simply more likely to have their founders replaced. In fact, it may be that replacing founders actually helps performance in general, but this selection of replacement in low-quality startups confounds the analysis. How can we tell whether replacement is helping or&amp;#160;hurting performance?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We addressed this question by assessing the connection between replacement and performance in a situation where it suddenly became more (or less) difficult to find a replacement for a founder who has left or was demoted or fired. Ideally, the replacement founder would be a senior executive with relevant industry experience. But such candidates are likely bound to their firms by a noncompete agreement. &lt;a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/41261726\"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that 70% of executives at public companies have signed noncompetes and that these contracts discourage them from taking jobs in the same industry.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., noncompete agreements are governed at the state level. In states that have made noncompetes harder to use, it should be easier to recruit replacement executives with industry experience, and vice versa. During our sample period,&amp;#160;14 states changed their noncompete policies, enabling us to test our hypothesis rigorously. Importantly, for these state-level changes to have an effect, it must be the case that replacement executives are usually recruited from within the same state. We found that there is indeed significant &amp;#8220;home bias&amp;#8221; in startup executive replacement hiring: Startups are twice as likely to hire from within the state than would be predicted if executives were selected randomly from any U.S. location.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We found that when state-level shifts in noncompete policy makes it easier to recruit replacement executives, the rate of replacement indeed rises. When policy makes it harder to recruit replacement executives, the rate of replacement falls. And when policy makes it easier to replace founders, the outcomes of startups where a founder is replaced improve&amp;#160;&amp;#8212; they&amp;#8217;re more likely to&amp;#160;go public or have a successful acquisition. When it&amp;#8217;s harder to recruit, the likelihood of achieving an IPO or successful acquisition falls.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we conclude that founder replacement, although it typically takes place among struggling startups, is beneficial on the whole. In our estimates, a 14% increase in the probability of a founder being replaced (one standard deviation) predicts a 25% higher probability of a successful exit.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, we consider when founder replacement makes the biggest difference. One perhaps unsurprising finding is that the replacement of founders with C-level titles is more consequential than those serving in VP-level roles. More interesting is what happens when a founder remains at the company, or doesn&amp;#8217;t. It might seem ideal for the founder to step down but remain with the company, but in fact startups perform better when the replaced founder leaves the company. We speculate that this might be because a deposed founder&amp;#8217;s sticking around may lead to confusion among the remaining employees, or the founder may even (attempt to) undermine their replacement, although we lack direct evidence on this point.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In sum, founders are right to worry that by raising external funding, they also raise the risk of losing their job. Although that fact had been previously established, the&amp;#160;effect on performance of the venture had not been. Our results suggest that founders might worry a bit less about being replaced &amp;#8212; at least from a financial perspective &amp;#8212; because their diminished role in the company may be rewarded with a higher value for their equity.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=jqycMROukds:UXS1ycXG3XM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=jqycMROukds:UXS1ycXG3XM:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/harvardbusiness/~4/jqycMROukds\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><feedburner:origLink>https://hbr.org/2018/02/research-what-happens-to-a-startup-when-venture-capitalists-replace-the-founder</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><title>Should You Cover for a Friend\u2019s Mistakes at Work?</title><id>tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.194463</id><link href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~r/harvardbusiness/~3/lNE77CkhfWs/should-you-cover-for-a-friends-mistakes-at-work\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" /><updated>2018-02-13T15:37:46Z</updated><published>2018-02-13T15:37:46Z</published><summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>Advice for when &#8212; or whether &#8212; to intervene.</p>\n]]></summary><author><name>Liane Davey</name></author><category term=\"Collaboration\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Collaboration\" /><category term=\"Ethics\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Ethics\" /><category term=\"Digital Article\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/contentType\" label=\"Digital Article\" /><content type=\"html\" xml:base=\"https://hbr.org/2018/02/should-you-cover-for-a-friends-mistakes-at-work\" xml:lang=\"en\">&lt;div class=\"mbn pbn\"&gt;\r\n&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-194615\" src=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_13_158927102.jpg\" srcset=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_13_158927102-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_13_158927102-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_13_158927102-500x281.jpg 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_13_158927102-383x215.jpg 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_13_158927102-383x215.jpg 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_13_158927102-500x281.jpg 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_13_158927102-700x394.jpg 700w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_13_158927102-850x478.jpg 850w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_13_158927102-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_13_158927102.jpg 1200w\" alt=\"feb18_13_158927102\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" sizes=\"(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit ptn mtn\"&gt;Cachetejack/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s nice to have a friend at work who cares about you and looks out for your best interests. &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/08/having-work-friends-can-be-tricky-but-its-worth-it\"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has even shown that&amp;#160;it contributes to your engagement. The benefits of having a friend at work are clear, but what about the downsides? What happens when your friend starts to let things slip? How do you handle it when you notice&amp;#160;they aren&amp;#8217;t keeping up? Should you cover for&amp;#160;them?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As with most difficult situations at work, there isn&amp;#8217;t one right answer. The approach you take depends on a variety of factors. First, how worrisome are the slips? Will they create significant problems for your team, or even your customer? Next, how self-aware is your friend about&amp;#160;their harmful behavior and the impact it&amp;#8217;s having? Finally, how is your friend&amp;#8217;s manager handling the situation? Is anyone other than you noticing the problem? The answers to these questions will help you decide when to intervene and how quickly to escalate from one of the following steps to the next.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The first couple of times your friend drops the ball, it&amp;#8217;s perfectly acceptable to cover for them. When I say &amp;#8220;cover,&amp;#8221; I don&amp;#8217;t mean hide the issue. I mean you can jump in and do the task yourself. For example, if your friend was supposed to guide a customer on a tour and is nowhere to be found, you might conduct the tour yourself. Covering could also mean you help diffuse&amp;#160;any negative consequences by acting as a character witness, such as by saying, &amp;#8220;I needed help a few times today, and Preet didn&amp;#8217;t have time to get to the report he was working on. I know he&amp;#8217;s focused on it now.&amp;#8221; Importantly, you shouldn&amp;#8217;t lie. Not only is it dishonest, but it could threaten both your standing and your friend&amp;#8217;s if the lie is exposed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as you need to cover a second time, make sure you take the opportunity to let your friend know that&amp;#160;their behavior had an impact. You don&amp;#8217;t need to be formal about it, but you do need to raise your friend&amp;#8217;s awareness of&amp;#160;their behavior. You could&amp;#160;say something simple, like, &amp;#8220;You had a tour scheduled at noon. I covered it for you. Where were you?&amp;#8221; If the answer causes you concern, you can probe a little further and see if there is something worrisome going on. Something as simple as &amp;#8220;Is everything all right?&amp;#8221; would do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;article-promo class=\"article-promo promo--half\"&gt;&lt;h4 class=\"mbs\"&gt;You and Your Team Series&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;h3 class=\"mbm text-gray-light\"&gt;Friendships&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"promo-contents\"&gt;\r\n\t&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;figure class=\"mbm\"&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;img src=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/01/widget-friends-01.jpg\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h6 class=\"hed mbs mtl\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/08/having-work-friends-can-be-tricky-but-its-worth-it\"&gt;Having Work Friends Can Be Tricky, but It&amp;#8217;s Worth It&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/h6&gt;\r\n\t&lt;div class=\"stream-item-info\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;ul class=\"byline byline-list line-height-tight\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Emma Seppala and Marissa King&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\t\t\r\n&lt;h6 class=\"hed mbs mtm\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/05/work-friends-make-us-more-productive-except-when-they-stress-us-out\"&gt;Work Friends Make Us More Productive (Except When They Stress Us Out)&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/h6&gt;\r\n\t&lt;div class=\"stream-item-info\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;ul class=\"byline byline-list line-height-tight\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;David Burkus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n&lt;h6 class=\"hed mbs mtm\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/11/can-you-be-friends-with-your-boss\"&gt;Can You Be Friends With Your Boss?&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/h6&gt;\r\n\t&lt;div class=\"stream-item-info\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;ul class=\"byline byline-list line-height-tight\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Karen Dillon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\t\t\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article-promo&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;If your friend continues to miss important duties, it&amp;#8217;s time to be more explicit with your feedback. At this stage, share your experience of the person&amp;#8217;s behavior and the impact it&amp;#8217;s having on you. Now is the time to switch to more-formal feedback. Even the change in your language and tone will signal that something is wrong: &amp;#8220;You were 30 minutes late for the team meeting this morning. I noticed Marie making a note in her book when you walked in. You&amp;#8217;re probably going to hear about this at your next meeting with her. What&amp;#8217;s up?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;If your friend is starting to take advantage of your generosity in covering for them, you should share the impact that&amp;#160;their behavior is having on you: &amp;#8220;You were 30 minutes late for the team meeting this morning. I had to cover the pipeline report for you. I felt unprepared and uncomfortable having to do it on the fly. What made you late?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;At some point, if your feedback isn&amp;#8217;t working, you&amp;#8217;ll need to change tacks. If every time your friend drops the ball, you&amp;#8217;re there to catch it, the consequences might not be grave&amp;#160;enough for&amp;#160;them to change&amp;#160;their ways. All you&amp;#8217;ve done by covering for your friend is show&amp;#160;them&amp;#160;you&amp;#8217;ll be accountable, so&amp;#160;they don&amp;#8217;t have to be. Now it&amp;#8217;s time to let something drop.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Choose your spot wisely; don&amp;#8217;t let something fall through the cracks that will be harmful to the team or visible to the customer. If your friend is ignoring internal deadlines or missing big chunks from the presentation&amp;#160;they&amp;#8217;re preparing, don&amp;#8217;t save the day. Give your friend&amp;#160;a heads up, and then leave it for&amp;#160;them to fix the situation. For example, say, &amp;#8220;I notice you don&amp;#8217;t have the competitive analysis in your presentation yet. I know Frank is expecting it to be in the draft.&amp;#8221; If your friend responds with puppy dog eyes and a plea for you to do that section, simply say &amp;#8220;no,&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;I can&amp;#8217;t.&amp;#8221; Don&amp;#8217;t make a big fuss over it, but stand firm.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, if this person is really a friend, you&amp;#8217;ll want to get a little more serious about understanding what&amp;#8217;s going on. Is it a particularly busy time at home? If so, you can suggest the person ask for help from other members of the team, rather than leaving everyone in the lurch. If it&amp;#8217;s something more worrisome, like a physical or mental health issue, your friend might be relieved to have someone to confide in. Don&amp;#8217;t push if your friend isn&amp;#8217;t comfortable discussing the problem. In that case, you can encourage&amp;#160;them to seek support outside the office.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This might be the time to engage your friend&amp;#8217;s manager in the conversation, particularly if the manager is supportive and focused on helping the team succeed. You can keep the conversation light and simply flag your concerns without causing alarm. For example, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve noticed my friend has missed a couple of&amp;#160;their deliverables this month. I asked&amp;#160;them about it, but they&amp;#160;didn&amp;#8217;t say much. I&amp;#8217;m worried. Would you have an opportunity to check in with&amp;#160;them this week?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Your approach needs to change as soon as your friend&amp;#8217;s dereliction of duty threatens the financial, reputational, or legal standing of your organization. At that point, you need to put your responsibility to your company above your sense of obligation to your friend. As with all of the situations above, you should be telling your friend what you&amp;#8217;re going to say before you say it: &amp;#8220;I can&amp;#8217;t let this one slide. The wrong shipment has gone to the client, and we need to rectify the situation before it causes problems for everyone.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;All of these scenarios, even the ones with the most basic comments to raise self-awareness, might feel uncomfortable. That&amp;#8217;s a sign that you care about your friend and want to maintain the relationship. Remember, true friends are the ones who do the kind thing to protect you and support you in the long term, rather than saying what you want to hear in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;If you have a friend who&amp;#8217;s not pulling&amp;#160;their weight, make it clear when you cover for them, share the impact&amp;#160;their behavior is having on both of you, let the natural consequences of&amp;#160;their inaction happen, and, if necessary, alert&amp;#160;their manager if the repercussions of&amp;#160;their behavior could have negative impacts on the team, the organization, or the customer. That&amp;#8217;s what a real friend would do.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=lNE77CkhfWs:8c5wkmw8L6o:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=lNE77CkhfWs:8c5wkmw8L6o:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/harvardbusiness/~4/lNE77CkhfWs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><feedburner:origLink>https://hbr.org/2018/02/should-you-cover-for-a-friends-mistakes-at-work</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><title>4 Ways to Build an Innovative Team</title><id>tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.194506</id><link href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~r/harvardbusiness/~3/wdw-jv_YqxI/4-ways-to-build-an-innovative-team\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" /><updated>2018-02-13T14:00:00Z</updated><published>2018-02-13T14:00:00Z</published><summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>It takes psychological safety, diversity, teamwork, and mission.</p>\n]]></summary><author><name>Greg Satell</name><uri>https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2014/06/110-Greg_Satell.jpg</uri></author><category term=\"Innovation\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Innovation\" /><category term=\"Leading teams\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Leading teams\" /><category term=\"Digital Article\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/contentType\" label=\"Digital Article\" /><content type=\"html\" xml:base=\"https://hbr.org/2018/02/4-ways-to-build-an-innovative-team\" xml:lang=\"en\">&lt;div class=\"mbn pbn\"&gt;\r\n&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-194602\" src=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-13-808427610-Ben-Birchall-PA-Images.jpg\" srcset=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-13-808427610-Ben-Birchall-PA-Images-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-13-808427610-Ben-Birchall-PA-Images-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-13-808427610-Ben-Birchall-PA-Images-500x281.jpg 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-13-808427610-Ben-Birchall-PA-Images-383x215.jpg 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-13-808427610-Ben-Birchall-PA-Images-383x215.jpg 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-13-808427610-Ben-Birchall-PA-Images-500x281.jpg 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-13-808427610-Ben-Birchall-PA-Images-700x394.jpg 700w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-13-808427610-Ben-Birchall-PA-Images-850x478.jpg 850w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-13-808427610-Ben-Birchall-PA-Images-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-13-808427610-Ben-Birchall-PA-Images.jpg 1200w\" alt=\"feb18-13-808427610-Ben-Birchall---PA-Images\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" sizes=\"(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit ptn mtn\"&gt;Ben Birchall/PA Images/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;One of the most common questions I get asked by senior managers is &amp;#8220;How can we find more innovative people?&amp;#8221; I know the type they have in mind &amp;#8212; someone energetic and dynamic, full of ideas and able to present them powerfully. It seems like everybody these days is looking for an early version of Steve Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yet in researching my book, &lt;a href=\"http://amzn.to/2zvJU7j\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mapping Innovation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I found that most great innovators were nothing like the mercurial stereotype. In fact, almost all of them were kind, generous, and interested in what I was doing. Many were soft-spoken and modest. You would notice very few of them in a crowded room.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So the simplest answer is that you need to start by empowering the people already in your organization. But to do that, you need to take responsibility for creating an environment in which your people can thrive. That&amp;#8217;s no simple task, and most managers have difficulty with it. Nevertheless, by following a few simple principles you can make a huge difference.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hire for mission.&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;In my previous company, we had a division manager&amp;#160;who wasn&amp;#8217;t performing the way we wanted her to. She wasn&amp;#8217;t necessarily bad. In fact, she was well liked by her staff, coworkers, and senior management. But she wasn&amp;#8217;t showing anywhere near the creativity required to take the business to the next level, and we decided to ease her out of her position.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Then a funny thing happened. After she left our company, she became a successful interior decorator. Her clients loved how she could transform a space with creativity and style. She also displayed many of the same qualities that made her so well liked as a manager. She was a good listener, was highly collaborative, and focused on results.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So why is it that someone could be so dull and unimaginative in one context and so creative in another? The simplest answer is that she was a lot more interested in interior decorating than she was in our business. Researchers have long established that &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/04/balancing-the-four-factors-tha-1\"&gt;intrinsic motivation is a major component&lt;/a&gt; of what makes people creative.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest misconception about innovation is that it&amp;#8217;s about ideas. It&amp;#8217;s not. It&amp;#8217;s about &lt;a href=\"http://www.digitaltonto.com/2017/dont-look-for-a-great-idea-look-for-a-good-problem/\"&gt;solving problems&lt;/a&gt;. So the first step to building an innovative team is to hire people interested in the problems you need to solve. If there is a true commitment to a shared mission, the ideas will come.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote psychological safety.&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;In 2012 Google embarked on an &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?_r=0\"&gt;enormous research project&lt;/a&gt;. Code-named &amp;#8220;Project Aristotle,&amp;#8221; the aim was to see what made successful teams tick. The company combed through every conceivable aspect of how teams worked together &amp;#8212; how they were led, how frequently they met outside of work, the personality types of the team members &amp;#8212; and no stone was left unturned.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;However, despite Google&amp;#8217;s nearly unparalleled ability to find patterns in complex data, none of the conventional criteria seemed to predict performance. In fact, what&amp;#160;it found that mattered most to team performance was psychological safety, or the ability of each team member to be able to give voice to their ideas without fear of reprisal or rebuke.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not just at Google. Harvard professor Amy Edmondson has &lt;a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/02-062_0b5726a8-443d-4629-9e75-736679b870fc.pdf\"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; the importance of psychological safety in a wide variety of contexts, from hospital teams to office furniture manufacturers. She found that it not only promotes a better atmosphere but also increases the capacity for learning and reduces the tendency to go down blind alleys.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/330/6004/686.full#aff-1\"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, done by researchers at MIT and Carnegie Mellon, found that teams in which people speak in roughly equal amounts far outperform those in which one or two people dominate the conversation. So those mercurial Steve Jobs types who are spouting off ideas so&amp;#160;often&amp;#160;that nobody can get a word in may in fact be killing innovation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, highly innovative teams can be safe for some ideas, but not for others. For example, two of the scientists at PARC, &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Shoup_(programmer)\"&gt;Dick Shoup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvy_Ray_Smith\"&gt;Alvy Ray Smith&lt;/a&gt;, developed a revolutionary graphics technology called &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperPaint\"&gt;SuperPaint&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, it didn&amp;#8217;t fit in with PARC&amp;#8217;s vision of personal computing, the two were ostracized, and eventually both left.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Smith would team up with another graphics pioneer, &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Catmull\"&gt;Ed Catmull&lt;/a&gt;, at the New York Institute of Technology. Later they joined George Lucas, who saw the potential for computer graphics to create a new paradigm for special effects. Eventually, the operation was spun out and bought by Steve Jobs. That company, &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar\"&gt;Pixar&lt;/a&gt;, was sold to Disney in 2006 for $7.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create diversity.&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;Many managers hire with a specific &amp;#8220;type&amp;#8221; in mind, usually people who seem most like themselves. This may be great for creating camaraderie and comfort, but it is not the best environment for solving problems. In fact, &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter\"&gt;a variety of studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that diverse teams are smarter, more creative, and examine facts more thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is that when you narrow the backgrounds, experiences, and outlooks of the people on your team, you are limiting the number of solution spaces that can be explored. At best, you will come up with fewer ideas, and at worst, you run the risk of creating an echo chamber where inherent biases are normalized and reinforced.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In effect, by creating a homogenous team, you are almost guaranteeing that the best answers will be found somewhere else. So instead of looking for comfort, you should be creating an environment where people expect to have their perspectives challenged by someone who looks, talks, and thinks differently.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The challenge for managers is to create an environment that is both diverse and psychologically safe. &lt;a href=\"https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=598084112068095077103106066125096026072005064017060018007087105099006102126006100106049109058005069113072124026105026031079051099064070123003112019031093111046073004006065022070111073030070100093024098065093122119112019127022111011011007100106&amp;#38;EXT=pdf\"&gt;Evidence suggests&lt;/a&gt; that diversity often reduces cohesion leads to discomfort. Any team can be safe when it is not being challenged. Great innovative teams learn to constructively work through these tensions.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value teamwork.&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;One of the most surprising &amp;#8212; and encouraging &amp;#8212; things I found while researching my book was how nice almost everyone I talked to was. Many of the people I spoke to were world-renowned scientists, executives, and entrepreneurs, so I expected to find many to be brash and arrogant, but what I found was just the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, in almost every case, I found that these superior innovators were friendly, gracious, and showed a genuine interest and desire to help me. Their behavior was so consistent that it couldn&amp;#8217;t have been an accident. So I did some further research and found that, when it comes to innovation, &lt;a href=\"http://www.digitaltonto.com/2017/generosity-can-be-a-competitive-advantage/\"&gt;generosity can be a competitive advantage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The truth is you don&amp;#8217;t need the best people&amp;#160;&amp;#8212; you &lt;a href=\"http://www.digitaltonto.com/2015/you-dont-need-the-best-people-you-need-the-best-teams/\"&gt;need the best teams&lt;/a&gt;. The problems we face today are far too complex to be solved by a lone genius working in isolation. That&amp;#8217;s why the best innovators tend to be &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2000/05/building-an-innovation-factory-2\"&gt;knowledge brokers&lt;/a&gt;, who embed themselves into networks so that they can access that one elusive piece of insight that can crack a tough problem.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So the last thing you want is the prototypical &amp;#8220;innovative&amp;#8221; personality spouting off a million ideas and breaking all the china. What you do want is people who can collaborate, listen, and build strong networks. The good news is you already have these people in your organization. Don&amp;#8217;t let them get drowned out.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=wdw-jv_YqxI:WFXQxsekPXk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=wdw-jv_YqxI:WFXQxsekPXk:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/harvardbusiness/~4/wdw-jv_YqxI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><feedburner:origLink>https://hbr.org/2018/02/4-ways-to-build-an-innovative-team</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><title>Do Women\u2019s Networking Events Move the Needle on Equality?</title><id>tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.193968</id><link href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~r/harvardbusiness/~3/LasCeJdQoa4/do-womens-networking-events-move-the-needle-on-equality\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" /><updated>2018-02-13T13:05:15Z</updated><published>2018-02-13T13:05:15Z</published><summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>Within one year, attendees of a conference for women were twice as likely to be promoted.</p>\n]]></summary><author><name>Shawn Achor</name></author><category term=\"Gender\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Gender\" /><category term=\"Leadership development\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Leadership development\" /><category term=\"Networking\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Networking\" /><category term=\"Digital Article\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/contentType\" label=\"Digital Article\" /><content type=\"html\" xml:base=\"https://hbr.org/2018/02/do-womens-networking-events-move-the-needle-on-equality\" xml:lang=\"en\">&lt;div class=\"mbn pbn\"&gt;\r\n&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-194601\" src=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-13-683860457-Martin-Konopka-EyeEm.jpg\" srcset=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-13-683860457-Martin-Konopka-EyeEm-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-13-683860457-Martin-Konopka-EyeEm-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-13-683860457-Martin-Konopka-EyeEm-500x281.jpg 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-13-683860457-Martin-Konopka-EyeEm-383x215.jpg 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-13-683860457-Martin-Konopka-EyeEm-383x215.jpg 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-13-683860457-Martin-Konopka-EyeEm-500x281.jpg 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-13-683860457-Martin-Konopka-EyeEm-700x394.jpg 700w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-13-683860457-Martin-Konopka-EyeEm-850x478.jpg 850w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-13-683860457-Martin-Konopka-EyeEm-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-13-683860457-Martin-Konopka-EyeEm.jpg 1200w\" alt=\"feb18-13-683860457-Martin-Konopka-EyeEm\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" sizes=\"(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit ptn mtn\"&gt;Martin Konopka/EyeEm/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was flying home from the Conference for Women, where I had been invited to speak.&amp;#160;I was carefully holding a copy of the conference program on my lap &amp;#8212; my mom likes to save them, and I wanted to be a good son and bring her back an unwrinkled copy.&amp;#160;The guy sitting next to me on the airplane noticed it and asked me about the conference. I told him it&amp;#8217;s a series of nonprofits across the country that run conferences for women from all industries to talk about leadership, fairness, and success. He then surprised me by saying, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m all for equality, but I&amp;#8217;m not sure what good a conference will do.&amp;#8221; Done with the conversation, he put on his headphones, content in his cynicism as I stewed, trying to come up with the best, albeit incredibly delayed, response.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;By the time I landed, I realized the best response to such a cynical attitude would be data. It won&amp;#8217;t change anyone&amp;#8217;s mindset to just claim that connecting&amp;#160;women is &amp;#8220;important&amp;#8221; and will &amp;#8220;have an impact at work and in society.&amp;#8221; We need to show that it actually does. That&amp;#8217;s why Michelle Gielan, best-selling author of &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Broadcasting-Happiness-Igniting-Sustaining-Positive/dp/1469002965\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Broadcasting Happiness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and I partnered with the Conference for Women to see if we could test the &lt;em&gt;long-term effects&lt;/em&gt; of uniting women. Spoiler alert: The results astounded even us.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;article-promo class=\"article-promo promo--half\"&gt;&lt;h4 class=\"mbs\"&gt;You and Your Team Series&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;h3 class=\"mbm text-gray-light\"&gt;Networking&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"promo-contents\"&gt;\r\n\t&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;figure class=\"mbm\"&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;img src=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/01/further-reading-widget-nertworking.jpg\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h6 class=\"hed mbs mtl\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/12/3-simple-ways-for-women-to-rethink-office-politics-and-wield-more-influence-at-work\"&gt;3 Simple Ways for Women to Rethink Office Politics and Wield More Influence at Work&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/h6&gt;\r\n\t&lt;div class=\"stream-item-info\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;ul class=\"byline byline-list line-height-tight\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kathryn Heath&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\t\t\r\n&lt;h6 class=\"hed mbs mtm\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/09/dont-waste-your-time-on-networking-events\"&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t Waste Your Time on Networking Events&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/h6&gt;\r\n\t&lt;div class=\"stream-item-info\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;ul class=\"byline byline-list line-height-tight\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Derek Coburn&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n&lt;h6 class=\"hed mbs mtm\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/04/5-misconceptions-about-networking\"&gt;5 Misconceptions About Networking&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/h6&gt;\r\n\t&lt;div class=\"stream-item-info\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;ul class=\"byline byline-list line-height-tight\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Herminia Ibarra&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\t\t\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article-promo&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In our initial study of 2,600 working women across functions and industries attending Conferences for Women in several U.S. states, we&amp;#160;examined several outcomes that occurred in the year after the women attended the conference. Since women who attend a conference might be different demographically and psychographically from women who elect not to, we used a control group that was made up of women who signed up for a conference but had not yet attended.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As part of the study, we were looking for two types of positive outcomes in women attending a conference: financial outcomes (pay raises and promotions) and intellectual outcomes (increased optimism, lower stress levels, and a feeling of connection). Since we were looking at financial outcomes, we made sure the time period we studied was the same for the research group and the control group, to account for any changes in the larger economic landscape.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;For the women who&amp;#8217;d signed up for the conference but had yet to attend, 18% received a promotion during the time period we studied, compared with 42% of women who had already attended the conference. In other words, in the year after connecting with peers at the Conference for Women, the likelihood of receiving a promotion doubled. (I wish I could find that guy on the plane to share this stat with him.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, 5% of the women in the control group received a pay increase of more than 10%, compared&amp;#160;with the 15% of women who had attended the conference.&amp;#160;That means that in one year, attendees had triple the likelihood of a 10%+ pay increase. (Remember, this isn&amp;#8217;t selection bias&amp;#160;&amp;#8212; women in the control group were also signed up&amp;#160;to attend a future&amp;#160;conference.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We also polled the women who&amp;#8217;d attended the conference about how it affected their overall outlook.&amp;#160;78% percent of&amp;#160;them reported feeling &amp;#8220;more optimistic about the future&amp;#8221; after attending. While&amp;#160;we did not compare this with the control group&amp;#8217;s outlook, this still seemed&amp;#160;like a significant finding to us in part because of what we know about how a positive mindset can affect other aspects of life. In my HBR article &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/01/positive-intelligence\"&gt;&amp;#8220;Positive Intelligence,&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; I describe how optimism can create a &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Advantage-Principles-Psychology-Performance/dp/0307591549\"&gt;&amp;#8220;happiness advantage,&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;where nearly every business and educational outcome improves as a result.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps&amp;#160;most tellingly, 71% of the attendees said that they &amp;#8220;feel more connected to others&amp;#8221; after attending. This is important. In my book &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Big-Potential-Transforming-Achievement-Well-Being/dp/1524761532\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big Potential&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I outline why the greatest predictor of success and happiness is social connection. &lt;a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691614568352\"&gt;Research has shown&lt;/a&gt; that social connection can be as predictive of how long you will live as obesity, high blood pressure, or smoking. There is power in connection. I start&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Big Potential&lt;/em&gt; with the story of a study of &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/13/science/a-mystery-of-nature-mangroves-full-of-fireflies-blinking-in-unison.html\"&gt;synchronous lightning bugs&lt;/a&gt; from Indonesia, in which researchers at MIT found that if lightning bugs light up alone, their success rate&amp;#160;for reproduction is 3%. If they light up simultaneously with thousands of other lightning bugs, their success rate rises to 86%. By lighting together, they could space themselves out to maximize resources, and the&amp;#160;increase in their collective brightness would help them be seen for up to five miles! I wrote &lt;em&gt;Big Potential &lt;/em&gt;because I have found that if people feel like they are trying to get out of depression alone, or fighting inequality alone, or striving for success alone, they burn out and the world feels like a huge burden. But there is a powerful, viable alternative to individually pursuing success and happiness: doing it together.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; conference would have such a long-term positive impact. I have been to quite a few where either the conference is unengaging or the attendees are disengaged and on their phones. I think it&amp;#8217;s safe to say there is an inverse&amp;#160;relationship between&amp;#160;the benefits you&amp;#8217;ll get from a conference and the time you spend on your laptop or phone.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But the key to a beneficial conference, based on my experience speaking at more than 900 conferences over the past 12 years, are (1) a sense of social connection felt by the attendees, (2) engaging sessions, (3) leaders who role model and exemplify the qualities that the conference is attempting to instill, (4) a memorable moment, and (5) a realistic assessment of the present with an optimistic look to the future. Based on the responses of the women in this sample group, we see elevated optimism and social connection, as well as superstar role models (for example, Michelle Obama and Bren&amp;#233; Brown also spoke at the event I went to). Moreover, many of the sessions offered practical applications for moving forward at work, such as how to ask for a raise, or stories from other women to let you know that your experiences at work are not unusual or isolated.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Laurie Dalton White, founder of the Conferences for Women, adds, &amp;#8220;Something special happens when you see that you are not alone. Making connections and building relationships with other attendees and speakers helps women form an understanding of their worth, and then they learn strategies to ask for promotions, seek fair pay, and even become mentors to others. We invite women like Michelle Obama and Sheryl Sandberg to speak at our conferences not just because of their own personal success stories, but because they are role models who inspire women in both big and small ways.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There is power in connecting, and it&amp;#8217;s not just about gender.&amp;#160;Men and&amp;#160;women alike can benefit from the power of connection. If you are a manager, encourage your employees to go to events where they can connect with others to remind them that they are not pursuing success and happiness alone. If you are a CEO, invest in conferences that help build up all members of your organization, regardless of where they sit in the organizational hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We have so much more to learn about the value of connection in a hyper-competitive world. To the guy sitting on my plane: This research shows that cynicism regarding women&amp;#8217;s conferences and initiatives is unfounded, unconstructive, and uninformed. To the rest of us seeking a positive path forward at work and in society, regardless of gender: We must pursue happiness and success together. Like the lightning bugs, rather than trying to light up the darkness alone and in isolation, there is power when we add our light to something bigger. In doing so, we shine brighter.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=LasCeJdQoa4:VgkOzIj8-C0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=LasCeJdQoa4:VgkOzIj8-C0:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/harvardbusiness/~4/LasCeJdQoa4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><feedburner:origLink>https://hbr.org/2018/02/do-womens-networking-events-move-the-needle-on-equality</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><title>How AI Is Changing Contracts</title><id>tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.194399</id><link href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~r/harvardbusiness/~3/RmlrhbHmjoA/how-ai-is-changing-contracts\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" /><updated>2018-02-12T15:54:58Z</updated><published>2018-02-12T15:00:38Z</published><summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>Think of a searchable database, not a set of files.</p>\n]]></summary><author><name>Beverly Rich</name></author><category term=\"Technology\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Technology\" /><category term=\"Operations\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Operations\" /><category term=\"Business law\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Business law\" /><category term=\"Digital Article\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/contentType\" label=\"Digital Article\" /><content type=\"html\" xml:base=\"https://hbr.org/2018/02/how-ai-is-changing-contracts\" xml:lang=\"en\">&lt;div class=\"mbn pbn\"&gt;\r\n&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_09_132075557.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-194498\" src=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_09_132075557.jpg\" srcset=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_09_132075557-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_09_132075557-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_09_132075557-500x281.jpg 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_09_132075557-383x215.jpg 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_09_132075557-383x215.jpg 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_09_132075557-500x281.jpg 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_09_132075557-700x394.jpg 700w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_09_132075557-850x478.jpg 850w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_09_132075557-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_09_132075557.jpg 1200w\" alt=\"feb18_09_132075557\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" sizes=\"(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit ptn mtn\"&gt;CSA Images/ Color Printstock Collection/Hayon Thapaliya/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Contracting is a common activity, but it is one that few companies do efficiently or effectively. In fact, it has been estimated that inefficient contracting causes firms to lose between &lt;a href=\"https://www.iaccm.com/resources/?id=8026\"&gt;5%&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"https://home.kpmg.com/au/en/home/insights/2017/03/supply-chain-capacity-management.html\"&gt;40%&lt;/a&gt; of value on a given deal,&amp;#160; depending on circumstances. But recent technological developments like artificial intelligence (AI) are now helping companies overcome many of the challenges to contracting.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The main challenge firms face in contracting arises from the sheer number of contracts they must keep track of; these often lack uniformity and are difficult to organize, manage, and update. Most firms don&amp;#8217;t have a database of all the information in their contracts &amp;#8211; let alone an efficient way to extract all that data &amp;#8211; so there&amp;#8217;s no orderly and fast way to, for example, view complex outsourcing agreements or see how a certain clause is worded across different divisions. It requires a lot of manpower to draft, execute, and improve not only the contracts themselves, but also the contracting processes and the transactions these contracts govern.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;If, for example, a large tech company finds itself with a huge volume of procurement contracts that all have varying renewal dates and renegotiation terms, it would require hundreds of hours and a team of contract managers to review and track of all this information to ensure that no renewal or opportunity is missed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;AI software, however, can easily extract data and clarify the content of contracts. (It could quickly pull and organize the renewal dates and renegotiation terms from any number of contracts.) It can let companies review contracts more rapidly, organize and locate large amounts of contract data more easily, decrease the potential for contract disputes (and antagonistic contract negotiations), and increase the volume of contracts it is able to negotiate and execute.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In my research, I have seen that many companies use contract management software, and a smaller number of firms &amp;#8211; mostly those with a high volume of routinized contracts &amp;#8211; use more advanced software with AI capabilities. These firms have generally seen an increase in productivity and efficiency in their contracting.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The use of AI contracting software has the potential to improve how all firms contract &amp;#8211; and it will do so in three ways: by changing the tools firms use to contract, influencing the content of contracts, and affecting the processes by which firms contract.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Tools for Managing Contracts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;While software for legal document review has existed for years, it typically only helps companies store and organize their contracts. Contracting software that uses AI raises the bar for what these tools can accomplish. AI contracting software can, for example, identify contract types (even in multiple languages) based on pattern recognition in how the document is drafted. Because AI contracting software trains its algorithm on a set of data (contracts) to recognize patterns and extract key variables (clauses, dates, parties, etc.), it allows a firm to manage its contracts more effectively because it knows &amp;#8211; and can easily access &amp;#8212; what is in each of them. AI software also offers simple prediction, which has implications for due diligence: AI contracting software can quickly sort through a large volume of contracts and flag individual contracts based on firm-specified criteria.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Current AI software can also read contracts accurately in any format, provide analytics about the data extracted from the contracts, and extract contract data much faster than would be possible with a team of lawyers. This may sound like bad news for lawyers, but this is not necessarily the case: having additional contract data could allow firms to update their contracts more regularly, and lawyers could focus more on their role as counsel instead of contract reviewer.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keeping Contracts Consistent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;AI contracting software helps firms keep terms and usage consistent in all of their contracts. For example, if a company wants to define the term &amp;#8220;confidential information&amp;#8221; in a specific way in its non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), it must make sure that all of its divisions are on board with this definition, and that changes to the definition get incorporated quickly and accurately, because variation could prove damaging to the company. AI contracting software can easily keep this term consistent across the firm&amp;#8217;s templates, and it can spot other terms that signal &amp;#8220;confidential information&amp;#8221; in NDAs from business partners.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Being able to identify and extract key data points helps firms organize and execute contracts as well. For example, a company with a large number of vendor contracts must ensure that they are keeping track of variations in termination provisions and penalty and damage provisions &amp;#8211; both in their own contracts and in vendor contracts. Managing variations is a huge undertaking that requires proactive organization. But AI contracting software can record and standardize these provisions in the company&amp;#8217;s contracts and in those that vendors send, making it far easier to identify instances of noncompliance and ensure that unfavorable provisions are dealt with promptly.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, AI contracting software can quickly assess risk in contracts (performing the risk analysis much faster than a team of lawyers) by identifying terms and clauses that are suboptimal. And it can reduce the risk of human error in contract drafting and review.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Processes Require New Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As new AI contracting tools change the actual content of contracts, this in turn affects the contracting processes that firms use. Previously, successful contracting required skills in drafting and negotiating contracts, as well as in managing and reviewing them. Specialized high-value transactions were dependent on groups of attorneys devoting hours to comprehensive due diligence. Contracting professionals were expected to find clever ways to draft contracts to include clauses that favored their client. And even more routine transactions required employees to pay close attention to details.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But when most due diligence and contract organization &amp;#8211; and even contract drafting &amp;#8212; is done using AI contracting software, the resources required to produce a large volume of contracts, both simple and complex, will change. This doesn&amp;#8217;t necessarily mean companies will need fewer lawyers, but rather their roles may transform. For example, lawyers will spend more time in assessing risk and providing counsel, rather than in document review. And instead of having a large team of associates conduct due diligence before a deal, companies will have a smaller, more agile team review the documents that the software flags and then offer advice. Indeed, Professor Gillian K. Hadfield, a law professor at the University of Southern California who specializes in contract law, believes that AI in contracting will lead to a better use of legal talent: &amp;#8220;lawyers will shift their focus from routine activities to much more high value work involved in shaping strategies and navigating complex legal problems.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the role of contract management professionals will shift. Whereas contract compliance was previously done by an entire team, AI tools enable a well-designed software platform &amp;#8211; coupled with a few employees &amp;#8211; to do the job. Rather than organizational skills being key to the role, contract managers will need more technical and process flow expertise to work with the software.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;These improvements to tools, content, and processes will mean that contracting becomes faster, better, and easier once this technology is more widespread. But it is important to recognize that, while AI promises to do a lot, it won&amp;#8217;t do everything.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Contracting technology is currently at a midpoint: One stream of development will be in industries with highly routinized, template-based contracts. Here, AI contracting technology will be used in a blockchain model, allowing contracts to evolve and essentially re-write themselves according to the parties&amp;#8217; needs. The other main use will be to help develop contracting standards, such as how to debate and structure certain clauses. When companies negotiating a contract can easily access every similar contract from the past twenty years, prioritized by industry, and see what wording is most commonly used, we should see less onerous negotiating over clauses, leading to an easier contracting process.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Understanding what AI contracting tools can and cannot do is key to their successful implementation and use. Right now, they may offer the highest value add to companies with large volumes of contracts &amp;#8211; cutting time spent in contract review and drafting &amp;#8211;&amp;#160;and companies that conduct more routinized transactions. But as this technology develops, it is all but certain that it will one day be useful to all firms.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=RmlrhbHmjoA:waY7Wrsmono:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=RmlrhbHmjoA:waY7Wrsmono:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/harvardbusiness/~4/RmlrhbHmjoA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><feedburner:origLink>https://hbr.org/2018/02/how-ai-is-changing-contracts</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><title>More and More CEOs Are Taking Their Social Responsibility Seriously</title><id>tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.194330</id><link href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~r/harvardbusiness/~3/3C2RsXDSolM/more-and-more-ceos-are-taking-their-social-responsibility-seriously\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" /><updated>2018-02-12T15:27:24Z</updated><published>2018-02-12T14:00:02Z</published><summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>Are we finally at a tipping point?</p>\n]]></summary><author><name>Rebecca M.

Yet, last month it joined with the California State Teachers&amp;#8217; Retirement System to &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/01/why-an-activist-hedge-fund-cares-whether-apples-devices-are-bad-for-kids\"&gt;send a letter&lt;/a&gt; to Apple&amp;#8217;s board warning about the effects of the company&amp;#8217;s devices on children. The same month, Blackrock CEO Larry Fink sent a letter telling companies that his firm would consider social responsibility when making investments. And Mark Zuckerberg told investors that Facebook &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104413015393571\"&gt;would be making changes&lt;/a&gt; to its platform that would help users in the long-term, even though, he warned, in the short-term the result would be users spending less time on it.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We are witnessing a big, transitional moment &amp;#8211; akin to the transition from analog to digital, or the realization that globalization is a really big deal. Companies are beginning to realize that paying attention to the longer term, to the perceptions of their company, and to the social consequences of their products is good business.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This realization is arriving not a moment too soon. The world badly needs a more sustainable form of capitalism if we&amp;#8217;re going to build a more inclusive, prosperous society and avoid catastrophic climate change. Of course, many of us have been saying this for a while &amp;#8211; that we need to think more about the long-term, consider social context, and incorporate sustainability into business. (Fink, to his credit, has been talking about long-termism &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/11/im-not-talking-about-this-to-win-a-popularity-contest\"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt;.) The question, then, is: why now? Why are more and more mainstream players taking this seriously?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;article-promo class=\"article-promo promo--half\"&gt;&lt;h4 class=\"mbs\"&gt;Series&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;h3 class=\"mbm text-gray-light\"&gt;The Economy in 2018&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"promo-contents\"&gt;\r\n\t&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;figure class=\"mbm\"&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/topic/economy\"&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;img src=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/01/econ-widget-further-reading-02.png\"&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\t\t\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article-promo&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In my discussions with executives and in my teaching at Harvard Business School, two answers come to mind. The first is millennials&amp;#8217; growing role in the workforce. My students today are more likely to focus on a business&amp;#8217;s impact on the environment or society at large, and to insist that companies have a positive social mission. The second is a declining confidence on the part of executives that government will step in and fix some of our biggest problems &amp;#8211; from climate change to inequality. &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/04/upshot/the-long-decline-of-trust-in-government-and-why-that-can-be-patriotic.html\"&gt;(This decline mirrors a decline among the broader population.)&lt;/a&gt; Both of these trends existed before Trump became president, but his election has accelerated them both.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Even so, the fundamental question around sustainable business remains how companies can bridge the gap between their own apparent self-interest and the broader needs of society. If a company decides to do the right thing, won&amp;#8217;t its competitors take advantage? That question remains critical. It&amp;#8217;s hard work to run a firm and to consistently make payroll, much less save the world. As I tell my students, rule one is: Don&amp;#8217;t crash the company. We can&amp;#8217;t expect managers to focus primarily on anything other than building a thriving, profitable enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;That said, there is growing recognition that over the long- or even the medium-term, the interests of companies and the interests of society are more aligned than many people once thought. In some industries and under some conditions, &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/04/the-type-of-socially-responsible-investments-that-make-firms-more-profitable\"&gt;socially and environmentally responsible firms are at least as profitable and sometimes more profitable&lt;/a&gt; than there conventional rivals, and there is &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/02/finally-proof-that-managing-for-the-long-term-pays-off\"&gt;some evidence to suggest&lt;/a&gt; that a focus on the long-term pays off. Moreover, many shareholders &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/02/finally-proof-that-managing-for-the-long-term-pays-off\"&gt;care&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/10/serving-shareholders-doesnt-mean-putting-profit-above-all-else\"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; more than short-term profits.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But there is one other reason all of this is happening now, one that perhaps represents a silver lining within a more worrying trend. It&amp;#8217;s no coincidence that the firms I mentioned above are Apple, Facebook, and BlackRock. Apple is an enormously powerful firm, and its actions can set the agenda for an entire industry. If an individual developer sets out to make an app that is better for kids, it may or may not gain any traction; if Apple makes this issue a priority, an entire ecosystem will shift. The same is true of Facebook. It has such a high share of the market that when there&amp;#8217;s a problem with fake news it becomes, in large part, Facebook&amp;#8217;s problem. BlackRock is a giant, too, and finance is another industry where a small number of big players dominate.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Big firms face different incentives, for a few reasons. To the extent these firms have market power, they&amp;#8217;re less subject to quarter-to-quarter competitive pressure. That means it&amp;#8217;s easier for them to focus on the long-term. And, to some degree, they have room to use that market power to pursue social objectives &amp;#8211; especially if their investors of their employees pressure them to do so.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Big firms can also internalize certain externalities. An externality is a cost from a transaction that doesn&amp;#8217;t fall on the buyer or the seller. If I pollute the air to make a product I sell to you, the cost of that pollution is spread out across society, and isn&amp;#8217;t incorporated in the price I charge you for the product. Externalities pose problems for markets, since neither buyer nor seller have any incentive to deal with the costs. But sometimes, for really large firms, things work differently.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A somewhat apocryphal story about Henry Ford illustrates the principle. One example of an externality comes when firms pay their workers too little. The firm doesn&amp;#8217;t necessarily bear the full cost from doing so (though it might bear some) nor does the firm&amp;#8217;s customers. Society, on the other hand, might pay substantial costs. For one thing, if workers don&amp;#8217;t have money to spend, the entire economy could suffer. Ford supposedly raised wages in his factories in part because he believed that if his workers had more money in their pockets, they&amp;#8217;d buy more Ford cars. &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-10-03/employees-are-not-your-customers\"&gt;The Ford story doesn&amp;#8217;t add up&lt;/a&gt;, if you assume that Ford believed that his move alone was enough to raise overall demand for cars.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But if you think instead that he was signaling to his competitors that if they all moved none of them would be at a disadvantage and that aggregate demand for the industry would increase, then the principle arguably holds in other contexts for some of today&amp;#8217;s giants. (And, of course, there&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w2101\"&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; that he was also hoping to reduce turnover &amp;#8211; which is entirely consistent with the idea that firms that handle this well look for short-term wins at the same time they&amp;#8217;re looking for longer-term changes.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Consider Facebook and news. If you sign-on to Facebook, read some fake news, and later tell several of your friends what you read, there&amp;#8217;s a clear negative externality. The cost to your friends of hearing that fake news wasn&amp;#8217;t considered in that interaction between you and Facebook. But what if instead of telling your friends in person, you shared the fake news on Facebook? There are still costs from fake news that are externalized. However, the higher the share of such discussion that happens on Facebook, the more that Facebook is forced to bear the cost. This dynamic is increasingly giving Facebook a significant incentive to take action.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#8217;t an argument for monopoly. There&amp;#8217;s considerable research suggesting the U.S. economy is too concentrated, and I&amp;#8217;m in favor of rigorous enforcement of antitrust laws. Nonetheless, I believe we must push the sustainability agenda as hard as we can, wherever we can. And right now, we are in a moment where big companies are waking up to the business case for social responsibility, and to the wisdom of taking a longer-term view. There are good reasons why large firms can be leaders in sustainability, and by doing so change the standards of entire industries. Big retailers and textile firms can make supply chains greener, safer, and less corrupt. And though this sort of self-regulation is seldom sufficient, it can lay the groundwork for systemic change.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We need more big companies to commit to renewable energy and to lobbying for legislation that imposes the real cost of burning fossil fuels on the buyers of fossil fuels. We need more big companies to commit to paying more than the minimum wage &amp;#8211; and to lobbying for minimum wage legislation. To say they&amp;#8217;re not going to dump stuff in the river, or buy from those who do. To insist that they won&amp;#8217;t corrupt local authorities in the developing world. And to demonstrate that you can be a successful business not just in spite of but &lt;em&gt;because of these commitments&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/07/22/global-500-in-6-charts/\"&gt;The top 500 firms&amp;#8217; revenues equate to nearly 37% of world GDP&lt;/a&gt;. What would happen if you could convince 100 of them to commit to go carbon-free and to take a less antagonistic view of their labor force?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;That scenario isn&amp;#8217;t likely. Nor is it a substitute to good public policy and healthy democratic governance. But it&amp;#8217;s more likely than it was just a few years ago. And it&amp;#8217;s a start.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=3C2RsXDSolM:ojEIdGL2YKM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=3C2RsXDSolM:ojEIdGL2YKM:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/harvardbusiness/~4/3C2RsXDSolM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><feedburner:origLink>https://hbr.org/2018/02/more-and-more-ceos-are-taking-their-social-responsibility-seriously</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><title>How Leaders Can Keep Their Cool in a Crisis</title><id>tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.193439</id><link href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~r/harvardbusiness/~3/IkoZkPxu4SE/how-leaders-can-keep-their-cool-in-a-crisis\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" /><updated>2018-02-12T15:27:42Z</updated><published>2018-02-12T13:05:43Z</published><summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>Advice from executives who&#8217;ve been there.</p>\n]]></summary><author><name>Mark Bonchek</name><uri>https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2014/05/110-bonchek.jpeg</uri></author><author><name>Cara France</name><uri>https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2013/11/110-cara-france.jpg</uri></author><category term=\"Leadership\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Leadership\" /><category term=\"Conflict\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Conflict\" /><category term=\"Crisis management\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Crisis management\" /><category term=\"Digital Article\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/contentType\" label=\"Digital Article\" /><content type=\"html\" xml:base=\"https://hbr.org/2018/02/how-leaders-can-keep-their-cool-in-a-crisis\" xml:lang=\"en\">&lt;div class=\"mbn pbn\"&gt;\r\n&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-194374\" src=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/01/feb18-12-51597496-george-silk-life.jpg\" srcset=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/01/feb18-12-51597496-george-silk-life-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/01/feb18-12-51597496-george-silk-life-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/01/feb18-12-51597496-george-silk-life-500x281.jpg 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/01/feb18-12-51597496-george-silk-life-383x215.jpg 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/01/feb18-12-51597496-george-silk-life-383x215.jpg 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/01/feb18-12-51597496-george-silk-life-500x281.jpg 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/01/feb18-12-51597496-george-silk-life-700x394.jpg 700w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/01/feb18-12-51597496-george-silk-life-850x478.jpg 850w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/01/feb18-12-51597496-george-silk-life-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/01/feb18-12-51597496-george-silk-life.jpg 1200w\" alt=\"feb18-12-51597496-george-silk-life\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" sizes=\"(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw\" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit ptn mtn\"&gt;george silk/life/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The word crisis suggests something that happens infrequently. But these days, crises have become a regular state of affairs. &lt;a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiki-tic-tac-trump-era-forces-consumer-brands-politics-113119468.html\"&gt;Brands&lt;/a&gt; that you&amp;#8217;d think would be fairly immune to scandal have found themselves embroiled in controversy. And those that deal with public relations challenges regularly have still been caught off guard by a &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/10/countering-a-customer-insurgen\"&gt;customer insurgency&lt;/a&gt;. Some crises disappear quickly and others never seem to go away.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;When it comes to a crisis happening, the question seems to no longer be &amp;#8220;if&amp;#8221; but &amp;#8220;when.&amp;#8221; Every leader needs to be prepared. By their very nature, crises put things in a whirlwind and emotions run high. So it&amp;#8217;s imperative that leaders keep their cool and make smart decisions.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To get inside the eye of the storm, we spoke with executives who have had to successfully navigate crises of all kinds. Here&amp;#8217;s what we learned:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can&amp;#8217;t pick your crisis.&lt;/strong&gt; The first thing to know is that you need to expect the unexpected. &amp;#8220;Rule Number 1,&amp;#8221; according to Jamie Moldafsky, CMO of Wells Fargo, &amp;#8220;is that you don&amp;#8217;t get to pick your crisis. You have to be ready.&amp;#8221; Brian Irving, former CMO of Hampton Creek, concurs: &amp;#8220;Your crisis is not the one you think it&amp;#8217;s going to be.&amp;#8221; We suspect that Skittles probably thought their crisis risk was more likely to come from a food safety problem than from &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/09/20/twitter-is-having-none-of-donald-trump-jr-s-skittles-tweet/?utm_term=.6e78411e9a07\"&gt;campaign tweets&lt;/a&gt;. Others like &lt;a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/02/09/donald-trump-ivanka-trump-nordstrom-twitter-boycotts/\"&gt;Nordstrom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oreo_boycott\"&gt;Oreo&lt;/a&gt; have similarly found themselves pulled unexpectedly into political debates. Regardless of the cause, the important thing is to have the right people, data, tools, process, and mindset to handle whatever might come your way.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t leave it to the lawyers.&lt;/strong&gt; When the crisis does hit, the first hours are essential. The usual response is for the CEO to huddle with his or her legal counsel and communications team. The focus is typically on assessing legal risks and figuring out how investors and the media will react. But there are other constituencies that need to be considered, too. Customers, employees, and partners are watching to see how the company reacts. Are you being transparent? Are you taking responsibility? Are you living up to your own mission and values? Involve your head of marketing and human resources early. They will have a perspective the lawyers won&amp;#8217;t have and need to be in the room when decisions are made.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;article-promo class=\"article-promo promo--half\"&gt;&lt;h4 class=\"mbs\"&gt;You and Your Team Series&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;h3 class=\"mbm text-gray-light\"&gt;Conflict&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"promo-contents\"&gt;\r\n\t&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;figure class=\"mbm\"&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;img src=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2017/05/further-reading-conflict.jpg\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h6 class=\"hed mbs mtl\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/05/how-to-have-difficult-conversations-when-you-dont-like-conflict\"&gt;How to Have Difficult Conversations When You Don&amp;#8217;t Like Conflict&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/h6&gt;\r\n\t&lt;div class=\"stream-item-info\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;ul class=\"byline byline-list line-height-tight\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Joel Garfinkle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\t\t\r\n&lt;h6 class=\"hed mbs mtm\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/04/how-self-managed-teams-can-resolve-conflict\"&gt;How Self-Managed Teams Can Resolve Conflict&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/h6&gt;\r\n\t&lt;div class=\"stream-item-info\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;ul class=\"byline byline-list line-height-tight\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amit Maimon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n&lt;h6 class=\"hed mbs mtm\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/03/even-experienced-executives-avoid-conflict\"&gt;Even Experienced Executives Avoid Conflict&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/h6&gt;\r\n\t&lt;div class=\"stream-item-info\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;ul class=\"byline byline-list line-height-tight\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ron Ashkenas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\t\t\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article-promo&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The story is worse than reality.&lt;/strong&gt; A consequence of the tendency to &amp;#8220;bunker&amp;#8221; the executive team is a lack of information flow to the wider organization. Brian Irving has observed that &amp;#8220;when there&amp;#8217;s a void of information, people will create their own story. The story they create is usually ten times worse than the reality.&amp;#8221; Marvin Chow, VP of Global Marketing at Google, emphasizes how important it is to create a vision and then build and show momentum. He suggests starting with the senior team to ensure alignment, then bringing the vision to the rest of the organization to make sure they understand where they are going and why. Once that is established, keep reinforcing the vision and show regular progress. This builds internal momentum and creates a culture in which the difficult or impossible becomes not only possible, but probable.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find your north star. &lt;/strong&gt;As a leader, it can be difficult to keep everyone motivated in a crisis, including oneself. Amy Friedlander-Hoffman, Head of Experiential Marketing at Uber, believes it is essential to keep &amp;#8220;coming back to the core.&amp;#8221; Personally, this means knowing &amp;#8220;Who I am and what am I bringing to this.&amp;#8221; As a company, this means, &amp;#8220;Who are we and what is our mission?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Jamie Moldafsky emphasizes the importance of staying positive and optimistic: &amp;#8220;You have to keep your eye on the long-term.&amp;#8221; According to Marvin Chow, it&amp;#8217;s easy to point out the problems. The challenge is being someone who gives answers and solutions. Stay true to your mission by focusing on the user or customer and doing what&amp;#8217;s best for them in a way that is meaningful to the brand.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; say.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the consequences of digital and social media is that a story can grow &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/07/how-to-create-an-exponential-mindset\"&gt;exponentially&lt;/a&gt; and go from zero-to-crisis in a matter of hours. It also means that you don&amp;#8217;t have the control over the story that you once had. Many who have been through a crisis note a shift in their thinking. Jamie Moldafsky observes that the focus used to be solely on the question &amp;#8220;What are &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; going to say about this?&amp;#8221; Now an equal concern is &amp;#8220;What are &lt;em&gt;others&lt;/em&gt; going to say about this?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The challenge is that by the time the crisis comes, it&amp;#8217;s often too late for many brands. You need to create a bank of goodwill when times are good, so that when a crisis comes, a community of advocates is ready to speak up, reassuring critics and reinforcing your message.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control what you can.&lt;/strong&gt; You might not be able to control what people say about you. But there is one thing you can control: yourself. According to Jamie Moldafsky, &amp;#8220;A crisis is a crisis. It&amp;#8217;s all about how you handle it. And that&amp;#8217;s within every leader&amp;#8217;s control.&amp;#8221; Amy Friedlander-Hoffman advises to &amp;#8220;get comfortable with being uncomfortable.&amp;#8221; You have a choice. &amp;#8220;You can come in every day trying to get your job done, frustrated that you have to keep putting out fires. Or you can realize that putting out fires actually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; your job.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix the underlying problem. &lt;/strong&gt;Sometimes a crisis is simply not your fault. But sometimes it&amp;#8217;s a symptom of a deeper problem in your culture, product, or operating model. If you don&amp;#8217;t fix the underlying problem, the crisis will go from &amp;#8220;one-and-done&amp;#8221; to one that goes &amp;#8220;on-and-on.&amp;#8221; Hannah Jones, Chief Sustainability Officer at Nike, believes a company &amp;#8220;should never let a crisis go unused or unleveraged.&amp;#8221; Instead, use it as an opportunity for &lt;a href=\"https://www.triplepundit.com/special/roi-of-sustainability/how-nike-embraced-csr-and-went-from-villain-to-hero/\"&gt;transformation&lt;/a&gt;. In Nike&amp;#8217;s case, complaints about worker conditions in the late 1990s was the impetus to &amp;#8220;tap into something deep within us about our values. We learned to respect differences, be empathetic, and find shared vision. We accepted accountability, apologized, and began to make the deep, systemic changes internally, in our supply chain, and to embark on a journey of collaboration and advocacy with the industry as a whole.&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s too easy in a crisis to just treat the surface symptoms, and not look to the underlying issues.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The lessons learned by executives who have weathered a crisis are relevant to anyone who finds themselves in challenging circumstances. We all have to get better at overcoming obstacles, dealing with uncertainty, and staying focused in a changing environment. It&amp;#8217;s good advice for everyone to be prepared, stay true to your purpose, involve others in solutions, control what you can, and work on the underlying issues.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=IkoZkPxu4SE:nkou4iZilDU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=IkoZkPxu4SE:nkou4iZilDU:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/harvardbusiness/~4/IkoZkPxu4SE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><feedburner:origLink>https://hbr.org/2018/02/how-leaders-can-keep-their-cool-in-a-crisis</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><title>When You Have to Carry Out a Decision You Disagree With</title><id>tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.193663</id><link href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~r/harvardbusiness/~3/GYeZiYoOHIM/when-you-have-to-carry-out-a-decision-you-disagree-with\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" /><updated>2018-02-12T15:28:13Z</updated><published>2018-02-09T14:00:19Z</published><summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you have to keep your opinions to yourself.</p>\n]]></summary><author><name>Art Markman</name></author><category term=\"Decision making\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Decision making\" /><category term=\"Leading teams\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Leading teams\" /><category term=\"Managing up\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Managing up\" /><category term=\"Digital Article\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/contentType\" label=\"Digital Article\" /><content type=\"html\" xml:base=\"https://hbr.org/2018/02/when-you-have-to-carry-out-a-decision-you-disagree-with\" xml:lang=\"en\">&lt;div class=\"mbn pbn\"&gt;\r\n&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_8_102662182.jpg\" sizes=\"(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw\" srcset=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_8_102662182-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_8_102662182-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_8_102662182-500x281.jpg 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_8_102662182-383x215.jpg 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_8_102662182-383x215.jpg 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_8_102662182-500x281.jpg 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_8_102662182-700x394.jpg 700w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_8_102662182-850x478.jpg 850w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_8_102662182-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_8_102662182.jpg 1200w\" alt=\"feb18_8_102662182\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-194389\" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit ptn mtn\"&gt;Sophie Blackall/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;One of the great frustrations of being a middle manager is that senior leaders make decisions that go against what you would have done had it been up to you. Sometimes you are part of the decision process, and other times the decision is simply handed down. Either way, you are now responsible for ensuring that the plan is carried out.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A natural reaction in this situation is to begrudgingly go along with the chosen course of action. You might even be tempted to communicate to your peers and supervisees that you&amp;#8217;re not convinced this is the right way to go.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Resist that temptation. Your job is to help your organization succeed. You won&amp;#8217;t be fulfilling that role if you &amp;#8212; intentionally or unintentionally &amp;#8212; &amp;#160;undermine the decision. Instead, start by asking yourself whether you trust the organization you work for.&amp;#160; If &amp;#8212; deep down &amp;#8212; you don&amp;#8217;t feel that senior management makes good decisions, it&amp;#8217;s probably time to start looking for another job.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But if you do trust the organization, then begin by convincing yourself that the decision is actually a good one. This is what I did early in my academic career when I received peer review comments on a paper I&amp;#8217;d submitted for publication. Without fail, there would be at least one reviewer who hated the paper. They did not get the point of my argument or they had reservations&amp;#160;about the studies I had done.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;When this first started happening, I hated those reviewers and assumed they hadn&amp;#8217;t read my paper carefully. Eventually, though, after I served as a reviewer on enough papers to realize that the authors whose papers I was reviewing probably wanted to dismiss my comments as well, I began to trust that the reviewers had valid points. Perhaps those points reflected my own bad writing, or (perish the thought), perhaps my experiments were not as brilliant as I thought they were. Ultimately, trusting that they had valid points made my papers better.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To convince yourself of the decision, put yourself in the shoes of someone who believes deeply in the decision that was made. Ask yourself why someone would make this choice. Look for factors you may not have considered before that would make this option a good one. While you&amp;#8217;re at it, also be explicit about all of your objections. Those will be useful as well.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#8217;ve wrapped your head around why this decision was reasonable, you&amp;#8217;re ready to start working with your team to carry out the new plan.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This approach helps you &amp;#8211; and your team &amp;#8211; in two ways.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;First, how much effort your team puts into making a plan succeed depends in large part on how much they believe in it. If you communicate a new course of action halfheartedly, you&amp;#8217;ll get less than peak effort because people will sense that you&amp;#8217;re not enthralled with the job to be done.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;article-promo class=\"article-promo promo--half\"&gt;&lt;h4 class=\"mbs\"&gt;You and Your Team Series&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;h3 class=\"mbm text-gray-light\"&gt;Decision Making&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"promo-contents\"&gt;\r\n\t&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;figure class=\"mbm\"&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;img src=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/01/further-reading-widget-decision-making.jpg\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h6 class=\"hed mbs mtl\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/07/how-to-beat-procrastination\"&gt;How to Beat Procrastination&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/h6&gt;\r\n\t&lt;div class=\"stream-item-info\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;ul class=\"byline byline-list line-height-tight\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Caroline Webb&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\t\t\r\n&lt;h6 class=\"hed mbs mtm\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/03/you-can-deliver-bad-news-to-your-team-without-crushing-them\"&gt;You Can Deliver Bad News to Your Team Without Crushing Them&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/h6&gt;\r\n\t&lt;div class=\"stream-item-info\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;ul class=\"byline byline-list line-height-tight\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Michelle Gielan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n&lt;h6 class=\"hed mbs mtm\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/08/what-to-do-when-youve-made-a-bad-decision\"&gt;What to Do When You&amp;#8217;ve Made a Bad Decision&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/h6&gt;\r\n\t&lt;div class=\"stream-item-info\"&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;ul class=\"byline byline-list line-height-tight\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dorie Clark&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\t\t\r\n&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article-promo&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Also, even the best plans run into some difficulties for a variety of reasons: the plan might be failing, more effort might be required, or the team needs to innovate to find the right way to implement it. How the people you work with interpret inevitable problems and what&amp;#8217;s required to remedy the situation depends on their commitment to the plan. If, spurred by your trepidation, they&amp;#8217;re already looking for reasons why the option will fail, they are much less likely to be motivated by difficulties they face than if they believe deeply that the plan will succeed. Communicating a plan with confidence can help create a self-fulfilling prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Second, the reservations you have about the decision can strengthen the plans you develop with your team. That list of objections you made when convincing yourself the plan is a good one comes in handy here: it reflects your beliefs about the potential obstacles to success. You are already aware of some of the reasons why the plan could fail. Use this list of obstacles to develop contingencies to handle what you think can go wrong. &lt;a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/1999-05760-004.html\"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that the better prepared you are for problems before they happen, the better able you&amp;#8217;ll be to handle them when they arise.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, teach this method of dealing with disappointing decisions to the people who work for you. When you move up in the organization, you are likely to make decisions that fly in the face of what some of the people believe is right. You want them to treat your choices with enough respect to give them the best chance to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=GYeZiYoOHIM:2EvC0eAR6gw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=GYeZiYoOHIM:2EvC0eAR6gw:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/harvardbusiness/~4/GYeZiYoOHIM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><feedburner:origLink>https://hbr.org/2018/02/when-you-have-to-carry-out-a-decision-you-disagree-with</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><title>Introducing Dear HBR:</title><id>tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.194450</id><link href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~r/harvardbusiness/~3/CyzwcMSCzlE/introducing-dear-hbr\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" /><updated>2018-02-09T21:54:51Z</updated><published>2018-02-09T19:12:42Z</published><summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>What should you do when you become the boss?

But there&amp;#8217;s a smaller community of people committed to addressing two more tangible risks: AI created with harmful biases built into its core, and AI that does not reflect the diversity of the users it serves. I am proud to be part of the second group of concerned practitioners. And I would argue that not addressing the issues of bias and diversity could lead to a different kind of weaponized AI.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The good news is that AI is an opportunity to build technology with less human bias and built-in inequality than has been the case in previous innovations. But that will only happen if we expand AI talent pools and explicitly test AI-driven technologies for bias.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminating Biases in AI: The People&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Technology inevitably reflects its creators in a myriad of ways, conscious and unconscious. The tech industry remains very male and fairly culturally homogeneous. This lack of diversity is reflected in the products it produces. For instance, AI assistants like Apple&amp;#8217;s Siri or Amazon&amp;#8217;s Alexa, which have default female names, voices, and personas, are largely seen as helpful or passive supporters of a user&amp;#8217;s lifestyle. Meanwhile, their male-branded counterparts like IBM&amp;#8217;s Watson or Salesforce&amp;#8217;s Einstein are perceived as complex problem-solvers tackling global issues. The quickest way to flip this public perception on its head is to render AI genderless, something I advocate for tirelessly and practice with Sage&amp;#8217;s personal finance assistant, &lt;a href=\"https://hellopegg.io/\"&gt;Pegg&lt;/a&gt;. The more long-term approach requires expanding the talent pool of people working on the next generation of AI technologies.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Diversifying the AI talent pool isn&amp;#8217;t just about gender. Currently, AI development is a PhD&amp;#8217;s game. The community of credentialed people creating scalable AI for businesses is relatively small. While the focus on quality and utility needs to remain intact, expanding the diversity of people working on AI to include people with nontechnical professional backgrounds and less advanced degrees is vital to AI&amp;#8217;s sustainability. As a start, companies developing AI should consider hiring creatives, writers, linguists, sociologists, and passionate people from nontraditional professions. Over time, they should commit to supporting training programs that can broaden the talent pool beyond those who&amp;#8217;ve graduated from elite universities. Recruiting diverse sets of people will also help to improve and reinvent AI user experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminating Biases in AI: The Technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Software and hardware engineers regularly test new technology products to ensure they are not harmful to people or businesses that will use them in the real world. Engineers conduct testing in labs and research facilities before a product launches. Ideally, any harmful attributes of the product are uncovered and removed during the testing phase. While that is not always the case, a fundamental and virtually universal commitment to testing does significantly decrease potential risks for everyone producing the products.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The same testing approach is used in the development of new AI technologies. People building AI test their systems for utility, safety, and scalability, with a focus on eliminating product flaws and security vulnerabilities. However, AI is unique in that it typically keeps learning and therefore changing after it leaves the lab.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Currently, though, there is a lack of testing AI products throughout their development cycle to detect potential harms they may do to humans socially, ethically, or emotionally once they hit the market. One way to remedy this is by adding bias testing to a new product&amp;#8217;s development cycle. Adding such a test in the R&amp;#38;D phase would help companies remove harmful biases from algorithms that run their AI applications and datasets that they pull from to interact with people.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Bias testing would also help account for the blind spots created by the lack of diversity at present in terms of who builds AI. It could help highlight issues which might not be immediately or traditionally obvious to the engineer and, most importantly, to the end user, &lt;a href=\"https://work.qz.com/1180607/amazons-alexa-is-now-a-feminist-and-shes-sorry-if-that-upsets-you/\"&gt;like how an automated assistant should respond when harassed.&lt;/a&gt; Some degree of testing will need to continue after a product is released, since AI algorithms can evolve as they encounter new data.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;AI-driven technologies will continue to integrate into the everyday lives of people around the world in meaningful ways. It will become commonplace at the office and at home &amp;#8211; and not only in the form of voice assistants like Amazon&amp;#8217;s Alexa or Google Home. AI-driven enterprise technologies will improve commercial productivity, close workforce skill gaps and bolster customer experience across industries. That&amp;#8217;s why now is the right time to implement methods that eliminate harmful biases and take gender out of the equation, expand the population of people working on technologies, and address trust issues with AI. The technology community must do all of these things to make AI&amp;#8217;s journey into the mainstream one that improves people&amp;#8217;s lives rather than tearing them apart.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=sT8EZt0WhrQ:VNPsvIEst3Y:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=sT8EZt0WhrQ:VNPsvIEst3Y:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/harvardbusiness/~4/sT8EZt0WhrQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><feedburner:origLink>https://hbr.org/2018/02/can-we-keep-our-biases-from-creeping-into-ai</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><title>How More Regulation for U.S. Tech Could Backfire</title><id>tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.194234</id><link href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~r/harvardbusiness/~3/zk0qMDHPME0/how-more-regulation-for-u-s-tech-could-backfire\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" /><updated>2018-02-12T15:27:57Z</updated><published>2018-02-09T15:16:22Z</published><summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>Today&#8217;s rules haven&#8217;t caught up to innovation.</p>\n]]></summary><author><name>Larry Downes</name><uri>https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2013/10/110-larry-downes.jpg</uri></author><category term=\"Regulation\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Regulation\" /><category term=\"Technology\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Technology\" /><category term=\"Digital Article\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/contentType\" label=\"Digital Article\" /><content type=\"html\" xml:base=\"https://hbr.org/2018/02/how-more-regulation-for-u-s-tech-could-backfire\" xml:lang=\"en\">&lt;div class=\"mbn pbn\"&gt;\r\n&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-194392\" src=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_8_643292892.jpg\" srcset=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_8_643292892-300x150.jpg 300w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_8_643292892-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_8_643292892-383x192.jpg 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_8_643292892-500x250.jpg 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_8_643292892-700x350.jpg 700w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_8_643292892-850x425.jpg 850w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_8_643292892-1200x600.jpg 1200w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_8_643292892-1900x950.jpg 1900w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18_8_643292892.jpg 1920w\" alt=\"feb18_8_643292892\" width=\"1920\" height=\"960\" sizes=\"(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit ptn mtn\"&gt;Alberto Manuel Urosa Toledano/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;If 2017 was the year that tech became a lightning rod for dissatisfaction over everything from the&lt;a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/the-honeymoon-is-over-in-silicon-valley-facebook-google-twitter/?ftag=CAD1c318f6&amp;#38;bhid=18768140301593834950979387608779\"&gt; last U.S. presidential election&lt;/a&gt; to the&amp;#160;&lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\"&gt;possibility of a smartphone-driven dystopia&lt;/a&gt;, 2018 already looks to be that much worse.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Innovation and its discontents are nothing new, of course, going back at least to the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, when Luddites physically attacked industrial looms. Hostility to the internet appeared &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/magazine/the-return-of-the-techno-moral-panic.html?utm_campaign=Newsletters&amp;#38;utm_source=sendgrid&amp;#38;utm_medium=email\"&gt;the moment the Web became a commercial technology&lt;/a&gt;, threatening from the outset to upend traditional businesses&amp;#160;and maybe even our deeply-embedded beliefs about family, society, and government. George Mason University&amp;#8217;s Adam Thierer, &lt;a href=\"http://reason.com/archives/2017/12/23/how-to-write-a-tech-panic-mani/\"&gt;reviewing a resurgence of books&lt;/a&gt; about the &amp;#8220;existential threat&amp;#8221; of disruptive innovation, has detailed what he calls a &amp;#8220;techno-panic template&amp;#8221; in how we react to disruptive innovations that don&amp;#8217;t fit into familiar categories.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But with the proliferation of new products and their reach ever-deeper into our work, home, and personal lives, the relentless tech revolt of the last year shouldn&amp;#8217;t really have come as any surprise, especially to those of us in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Still, the only solution critics can propose for our growing tech malaise is government intervention &amp;#8212; usually expressed vaguely as &lt;a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/339a30ac-c281-11e7-a1d2-6786f39ef675\"&gt;&amp;#8220;regulating tech&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"http://www.aei.org/publication/should-washington-break-up-big-tech/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;#38;utm_medium=paramount&amp;#38;utm_campaign=cict\"&gt;&amp;#8220;breaking up&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; the biggest and most successful Internet companies.&amp;#160; Break-ups, which require a legal finding that the structure of a company is enabling anti-competitive behavior, seem now to have become a &lt;a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-antitrust-case-against-facebook-google-amazon-and-apple-1516121561\"&gt;synonym for somehow crippling&lt;/a&gt; a successful enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, nobody thinks technology companies should be left unregulated. Tech companies, like any other enterprise, are already subject to a complex tangle of laws, varying based on industry and local authority. They all pay taxes, report their finances, disclose significant shareholders, and comply with the full range of employment, health and safety, advertising, intellectual property, consumer protection and anti-competition laws, to name just a few.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There are also specialized laws for tech, including limits on how Internet companies &lt;a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule\"&gt;can engage with children&lt;/a&gt;. In the U.S., commercial drones must be registered with the Federal Aviation Administration. Genetic testing and other health-related devices must pass muster with the Food and Drug Administration. Increasingly, &lt;a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f280664-e565-11e7-97e2-916d4fbac0da\"&gt;ride-sharing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/02/20/airbnb-uber-tech-regulations/\"&gt;casual rental services&lt;/a&gt; must meet the some of the same standards and inspections as long-time transportation and hospitality incumbents.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There are growing calls, likewise, to regulate social media and video platforms &lt;a href=\"http://www.multichannel.com/news/congress/pallone-google-facebook-twitter-content-treatment-not-neutral/416099\"&gt;as if they were traditional print or broadcast news sources&lt;/a&gt;, even though doing so would almost certainly run afoul of the very free speech protections &lt;a href=\"https://www.axios.com/cloudflare-ceo-1512745348-131a5234-f9de-4920-a599-edf59c971a3b.html\"&gt;proponents are hoping to preserve&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But perhaps what tech critics really want are more innovative rules. Traditional regulations, after all, were designed in response to earlier technologies and the market failures they generated. They don&amp;#8217;t cover largely speculative and mostly future-looking concerns.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;What if, for example, artificial intelligence &lt;a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/technology/364482-lawmakers-introduce-bipartisan-ai-legislation\"&gt;puts an entire generation out of work&lt;/a&gt;? What if genetic manipulations &lt;a href=\"http://time.com/4626571/crispr-gene-modification-evolution/\"&gt;accidentally unravel&lt;/a&gt; the fabric of DNA, reversing evolution in one fell swoop? What if social media companies learn so much about us that &lt;a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/technology/365827-former-fcc-chair-calls-for-regulating-tech-giants\"&gt;they undermine&amp;#8212;intentionally or otherwise&amp;#8212;democratic institutions&lt;/a&gt;, creating a tyranny of &amp;#8220;unregulated&amp;#8221; big data controlled by a few unelected young CEOs?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The problem with such speculation is that it is just that. In deliberative government, legislators and regulatory agencies must weigh the often-substantial costs of proposed limits against their likely benefit, balanced against the harm of simply leaving in place the current legal status quo.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#8217;s no scientific method for estimating the risk of prematurely shutting down experiments that could yield important discoveries. There&amp;#8217;s no framework for pre-emptively regulating nascent industries and potential new technologies. By definition, they&amp;#8217;ve caused no measurable harm.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In particular, breaking up the most successful Internet and cloud-based companies &lt;a href=\"http://reason.com/archives/2017/12/23/how-to-write-a-tech-panic-mani/\"&gt;only looks like a solution&lt;/a&gt;. It isn&amp;#8217;t. Antitrust is meant to punish dominant companies that use their leverage to raise costs for consumers. Yet the services provided by technology companies are often widely available at little or no cost. Many of the products and services of Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft &amp;#8212; the internet giants referred to by the New York Times as &amp;#8220;the frightful five&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; are free for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;More to the point, break-ups almost always backfire. Think of the former AT&amp;#38;T, which was regulated as a monopoly utility until 1982, when the government changed its mind and &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System\"&gt;split the company&lt;/a&gt; into component long-distance and regional phone companies. The sum of the parts actually increased in value &amp;#8212;except for the long-distance company, &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/30/business/30tele.html\"&gt;which faded in the face of&lt;/a&gt; unregulated new competitors.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Then, over the next 20 years, the regional companies put themselves back together, and, with economies of scale, reemerged as a mobile internet network and Pay TV provider, competing with cable companies and fast-growing internet-based video services including YouTube, Amazon and Netflix. What started as a regulatory punishment for AT&amp;#38;T led to an even bigger network of companies.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the constant threat of a forced divestiture can be disastrous for consumers and enterprise alike. IBM prevailed &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/ibm-and-microsoft-antitrust-then-and-now/\"&gt;against multiple efforts to break it up along product lines&lt;/a&gt;, but was so shaken by the decades-long experience that the company became dangerously timid about future innovations, missing the shifts first to client-server and then to Internet-based computing architectures, nearly bankrupting the business.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, similarly, was so distracted by its multi-year fight to avoid break-up both by U.S. and European regulators that it &lt;a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/2493398/search/will-google-go-the-way-of-microsoft--ask-the-ftc-.html\"&gt;lost essential momentum&lt;/a&gt;. It mostly missed out on the mobile revolution, and hesitated in responding to open-source alternatives to operating systems, desktop applications, and other software apps that seriously eroded the company&amp;#8217;s once-formidable competitive advantage. (The company is now growing a &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/technology/microsoft-cloud-computing.html\"&gt;cloud services business&lt;/a&gt;, but is still far behind Google and Amazon.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;These examples hint at an alternative to random and unproven new forms of regulation for emerging technologies: simply waiting for the next generation of innovations and the entrepreneurs who wield them to disrupt the supposed monopolists right out of their disagreeable behaviors, sometimes fatally.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Today, it might seem that the companies in the frightful five have unbeatable leads in retailing and cloud services, social media, search, advertising, desktop operating systems and mobile devices. But the landscape of business history is littered with the corpses of supposedly invulnerable giants. In our research on wildly-successful enterprises who &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/01/finding-your-companys-second-act\"&gt;fail to find a second act&lt;/a&gt;, Paul Nunes and I note that the average life span of companies on the Standard &amp;#38; Poor&amp;#8217;s 500 has fallen from 67 years in the 1920s to just 15 years today.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In the early years of the internet age, a half-dozen companies were serially crowned the victor in search, only to be unseated by more innovative technology soon after. Yahoo and others gave way to Google, just as Blackberry faded in response to the iPhone. MySpace (remember them?) collapsed at the introduction of Facebook, which, at the time, was little more than a bit of software from a college student. Napster lost in court (no new laws were needed for that), leaving Apple to define a working market for digital music. And who remembers &lt;a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2000/04/consumers-blast-aol-merger/\"&gt;the alarm bells rung in 2000&lt;/a&gt; when then-dominant ISP America On-Line merged with content behemoth Time Warner?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The best regulator of technology, it seems, is simply more technology. And despite fears that channels are blocked, markets are locked up, and gatekeepers have closed networks that the next generation of entrepreneurs need to reach their audience, somehow they do it anyway&amp;#8212;often embarrassingly fast, whether the presumed tyrant being deposed is a long-time incumbent or last year&amp;#8217;s startup darling.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;That, in any case, is the theory on which U.S. policymakers across the political spectrum have nurtured technology-based innovation since the founding of the Republic. Taking the long view, it&amp;#8217;s clearly been a winning strategy, especially when compared to the more invasive, command-and-control approach taken by the European Union, which continues to &lt;a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/10/how-to-understand-the-eu-u-s-digital-divide\"&gt;lag on every measure of the Internet economy&lt;/a&gt;. (Europe&amp;#8217;s strategy now seems to be little more than to &lt;a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2017/12/25/europe-vs-silicon-valley-how-the-continent-is-responding-to-big-techs-growing-power/\"&gt;hobble U.S. tech companies&lt;/a&gt; and hope for the best.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Or compared to China, which has built tech giants of its own, but only by &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/07/15/chinas-stock-market-is-falling-but-its-innovators-are-still-rising-fast/?utm_term=.c9da8f1631f0\"&gt;limiting outside access&lt;/a&gt; to its singularly enormous local market. And always with the risk that too much success by Chinese entrepreneurs may one day crash headfirst into a political culture that is at deeply uncomfortable with the internet&amp;#8217;s openness.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;That solution&amp;#8212;to stay the course, to continue leaving tech largely to its own correctives&amp;#8212;is cold comfort to those who believe tomorrow&amp;#8217;s problems, coming up fast in the rear-view mirror, are both unprecedented and catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yet, so far there&amp;#8217;s no evidence supporting shrill predictions of a technology-driven apocalypse. Or that existing safeguards &amp;#8212; both market and legal &amp;#8212; won&amp;#8217;t save us from our worst selves.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Nor have tech&amp;#8217;s growing list of critics proposed anything more specific than simply calling for &amp;#8220;regulation&amp;#8221; to save us. Perhaps that&amp;#8217;s because effective remedies are incredibly hard to design.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=zk0qMDHPME0:mA7PAk_0JbM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=zk0qMDHPME0:mA7PAk_0JbM:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/harvardbusiness/~4/zk0qMDHPME0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><feedburner:origLink>https://hbr.org/2018/02/how-more-regulation-for-u-s-tech-could-backfire</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><title>Why Amazon\u2019s Grocery Store May Not Be the Future of Retail</title><id>tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.193829</id><link href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~r/harvardbusiness/~3/iPCaUic54Tk/why-amazons-grocery-store-may-not-be-the-future-of-retail\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" /><updated>2018-02-12T15:28:47Z</updated><published>2018-02-08T15:15:28Z</published><summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>Don&#8217;t rip out the registers just yet.</p>\n]]></summary><author><name>Nick Harrison</name></author><author><name>George Faigen</name></author><author><name>Duncan Brewer</name></author><category term=\"Innovation\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Innovation\" /><category term=\"Technology\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Technology\" /><category term=\"Competition\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Competition\" /><category term=\"Retail &amp; Consumer Goods\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/industry\" label=\"Retail &amp; Consumer Goods\" /><category term=\"Technology\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/industry\" label=\"Technology\" /><category term=\"Digital Article\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/contentType\" label=\"Digital Article\" /><content type=\"html\" xml:base=\"https://hbr.org/2018/02/why-amazons-grocery-store-may-not-be-the-future-of-retail\" xml:lang=\"en\">&lt;div class=\"mbn pbn\"&gt;\r\n&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-194222\" src=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-08-740519487-Harry-Haysom.jpg\" srcset=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-08-740519487-Harry-Haysom-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-08-740519487-Harry-Haysom-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-08-740519487-Harry-Haysom-500x281.jpg 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-08-740519487-Harry-Haysom-383x215.jpg 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-08-740519487-Harry-Haysom-383x215.jpg 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-08-740519487-Harry-Haysom-500x281.jpg 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-08-740519487-Harry-Haysom-700x394.jpg 700w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-08-740519487-Harry-Haysom-850x478.jpg 850w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-08-740519487-Harry-Haysom-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-08-740519487-Harry-Haysom.jpg 1200w\" alt=\"feb18-08-740519487-Harry-Haysom\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" sizes=\"(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit ptn mtn\"&gt;Harry Haysom/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;When Amazon opened its cashier-less concept grocery store to the public in Seattle on January 22, the company&amp;#8217;s stock rose 2.5% &amp;#8211; slightly more than the 2.4% increase after Amazon announced that it was buying Whole Foods this past June. Does &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/b?node=16008589011\"&gt;Amazon Go&lt;/a&gt; signal that smartphone apps and virtual carts will replace checkouts in grocery stores?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A low-cost, automated store is certainly an experiment worth watching. But retailers shouldn&amp;#8217;t rush to rip out their registers just yet. Retail is littered with promising technologies introduced with great fanfare that didn&amp;#8217;t become mainstream because they didn&amp;#8217;t sufficiently benefit either the retailer or the customer.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;One reason is that new tools often don&amp;#8217;t save the retailer enough or generate sufficient new revenue to cover their cost. Another is that too many customers simply don&amp;#8217;t like them. To become the new normal, a technology has to make it beyond the early adopters &amp;#8211; typically 10 to 15% of retail shoppers &amp;#8211; and appeal to the less tech-savvy majority.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Amazon Go may face challenges in both respects: It is unclear its eventual savings will justify the investment, or whether customers will find the digital surveillance it entails to be a tolerable price to pay for an improved shopping experience. &lt;a href=\"http://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2017/apr/digital-families.html\"&gt;Our survey&lt;/a&gt; of 1,500 British consumers revealed that 19% would consider an app that tracked them an invasion of privacy. &amp;#160;So before adopting any technology, retailers must answer two questions: How does this benefit us? And will consumers like it? Let&amp;#8217;s look at how retailers have &amp;#8212; or have failed to &amp;#8212; &amp;#160;answer these questions.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Radio-Frequency Identification&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Starting in the mid-1990s, RFID was expected to transform inventory control by using electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. It also promised to obviate the need for manual barcode scanning at checkouts. But the tags never took off, because their cost was never offset by sufficient benefits.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Consumers were satisfied with bar scanning for most products, and retailers found better alternative processes to track their inventory. At the British retailer John Lewis, for example, store staff today can scan an item of clothing in a store to find out what sizes are available on the shelf, in the back room, and in a warehouse for online delivery, and then send a customer all the details by email.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In grocery, where checking out is the most cumbersome part of shopping, the cost of putting RFID tags on inexpensive items made the technology a non-starter. When every penny of cost matters on a case of shipped product, spending more for simple RFID tags or for intelligent tags that track temperature and other data points just does not make economic sense.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Self-Checkout&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Self-checkouts have proved more successful. But more than 10 years since their introduction, most consumers choose them only if lines at conventional checkouts are a big hassle. Retailers have nonetheless embraced them where space is a constraint or labor costs are high. Self-checkouts have become commonplace in convenience stores in the United Kingdom where customers are in a hurry and other parts of Europe, such as the Netherlands, where floor space is limited. But fewer retailers and consumers in the United States consider self-checkouts worthwhile, even in dense urban areas such as New York City, because labor costs and the average value of sales per square foot are usually lower and the lines are just not that bad.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the limits on what customers and machines can do themselves reduce the effectiveness of self-checkout. Staff are still needed to check some customers&amp;#8217; bags to reduce theft and to OK their IDs for buying, say, a bottle of wine. Customers find this mildly inconvenient, while retailers have to employ people, reducing the labor savings they might have expected.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Electronic Shelf Labels&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Electronic shelf labels allow store managers to change price displays more easily or to have them update automatically. They are slowly catching on, but it&amp;#8217;s taken a decade. The early tags were expensive and often difficult for customers to read, and they were only adopted in markets such as France where store staff are paid relatively well, making the labor savings compelling.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But now that upfront installation cost of the tags is declining, more retailers are experimenting. The displays are improving, allowing retailers to show more product information and promotional offers. Today&amp;#8217;s labels also have the potential for making real-time price changes that respond to things like surges in supply or expiration dates.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Mobile Payments&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of excitement around the use of mobile phone apps, such as Apple Pay, to make payments. Many retailers are considering their own payment apps in part to avoid credit card fees and encourage customers to pre-pay for purchases before they even reach the store. &amp;#160;But relatively few consumers use these apps. While many are comfortable with them, most still find their chip, or contactless, credit and debit cards just as easy, fast, and secure. To encourage the use of apps, some retailers, including Starbucks, are starting to offer inducements such as extra loyalty points.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The stock market was excited about Amazon Go because it signaled a promising new technology by a digital retail powerhouse that is aggressively moving into physical stores. If Amazon is right, investors are betting, the model could transform traditional retail. But it won&amp;#8217;t happen unless the benefits to retailer and customer decisively outweigh the cost of the technology&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;That may not be a major concern for a deep-pocketed company like Amazon, which is perpetually trying new things, learning from mistakes, and then moving on to the next potential big thing. Amazon has already benefited from the industry buzz around its concept store, which could very well set customer expectations for the in-store experience of the future. But other retailers will most likely find the initial costs too high and benefits too uncertain to immediately follow in Amazon&amp;#8217;s footsteps. Instead, they should watch closely and be prepared to make a move &amp;#8212;if the system makes economic sense, and if consumers like it.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=iPCaUic54Tk:2Z1AQk2IrzI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=iPCaUic54Tk:2Z1AQk2IrzI:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/harvardbusiness/~4/iPCaUic54Tk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><feedburner:origLink>https://hbr.org/2018/02/why-amazons-grocery-store-may-not-be-the-future-of-retail</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><title>How Cloud Computing Is Changing Management</title><id>tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.194026</id><link href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~r/harvardbusiness/~3/9yqfNC7BeVA/how-cloud-computing-is-changing-management\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" /><updated>2018-02-12T15:29:05Z</updated><published>2018-02-08T14:00:18Z</published><summary type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s speeding up product life cycles and fostering more customer interaction.</p>\n]]></summary><author><name>Quentin Hardy</name></author><category term=\"Technology\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Technology\" /><category term=\"Product development\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/subject\" label=\"Product development\" /><category term=\"Technology\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/industry\" label=\"Technology\" /><category term=\"Digital Article\" scheme=\"http://hbr.org/categorization/contentType\" label=\"Digital Article\" /><content type=\"html\" xml:base=\"https://hbr.org/2018/02/how-cloud-computing-is-changing-management\" xml:lang=\"en\">&lt;div class=\"mbn pbn\"&gt;\r\n&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-194220\" src=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-08-183710738-yagi-studio.jpg\" srcset=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-08-183710738-yagi-studio-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-08-183710738-yagi-studio-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-08-183710738-yagi-studio-500x281.jpg 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-08-183710738-yagi-studio-383x215.jpg 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-08-183710738-yagi-studio-383x215.jpg 383w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-08-183710738-yagi-studio-500x281.jpg 500w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-08-183710738-yagi-studio-700x394.jpg 700w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-08-183710738-yagi-studio-850x478.jpg 850w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-08-183710738-yagi-studio-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-08-183710738-yagi-studio.jpg 1200w\" alt=\"feb18-08-183710738-yagi-studio\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" sizes=\"(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption class=\"credit ptn mtn\"&gt;yagi studio/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Theories and practices of management often spring from the opportunities created by new technologies.

Client-server technology begat enterprise resource planning systems, and the consequent system-wide visibility that was required for what we call business process management (BPM).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;That makes it imperative to start thinking about how management will be changed by the most impactful information technology of our time: cloud computing. What does it allow us to do differently, and how will that change the way we do things in the future?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;History suggests that the main way information technology changes management is through changes in how information is gathered: the large-scale analysis of Operations Research reflected painstaking data collection around a few metrics, which were transferred to punch cards. BPM reflected the interactions of different stakeholders, from product creation through supply chain to final assembly.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;How organizations are changing&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;With cloud, information travels rapidly in both directions, across computing systems that, with attributes like virtualization, scaling up or down to handle bigger workloads, or automated security patching across thousands of machines, are far more flexible. This will likely mean a more flexible work structure as well, in the interest of products and services that ideally can be adjusted to anticipate customer needs. Key to the new system are rapid data collection and analysis, followed by over the air changes to product software.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Likely outcomes of the move to cloud include changing how products are designed; closer collaboration between the corporate IT department and other business units, including sales, finance and forecasting; and more customer interaction, even to a point of jointly developing products with their consumers. In particular, new ways of writing and deploying software will encourage new types of faster-acting organizational designs. And the best way to anticipate how these changes will occur is to hear from companies already aggressively implementing them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s already changing organizations, by moving IT from a cost center to something with a place at the table in a lot of different meetings,&amp;#8221; said Chris Jackson, head of cloud platforms at Pearson, a global learning company. If Pearson is looking at, say, a new online learning course, Mr. Jackson is part of early product design meetings, offering tips on what user interaction data should be collected, how, and how often a course might be tweaked. A job like his used to be concerned only with things that happened later in the process, like launching and maintaining a piece of software.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Public cloud computing, offered by companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and my employer, Google Cloud, is still viewed by many as a cheaper and more efficient way for companies to store and process data. The cost may be lower, but like traditional computers, it is still a cost.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Lower costs have been reason enough for many companies to shut down their proprietary data centers and consume computational power and attendant software as a series of on-demand services. Others use cloud computing software in their own data centers, as a means of increasing resources and working faster.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;How it effects product design and customer experience&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As cloud technology improves, however, it is becoming easier for companies to create products and services within the cloud, or model new products or marketing campaigns as cloud-based software prototypes. The cloud is also a common repository for the collection and analysis of new data, and the place where an increasing number of artificial intelligence operations, like image and speech recognition, are conducted.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The evidence is already there, as startups increasingly conceive of their goods and services largely as software-centric entities, from which data is continually derived. Changes and upgrades become part of a continuous process. Organizational functions blur as processes become increasingly iterative.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The ride-hailing company &lt;a href=\"https://eng.uber.com/tech-stack-part-one/\"&gt;Uber has stressed&lt;/a&gt; the importance of its hybrid cloud model to ensure not just constant uptime, but an indivisible relationship between product development and deployment. Uber is able to model a virtual fleet of taxis from private cars through a combination of mobile software, large-scale data analysis, mapping, and social networking.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A similar dynamic of redefined processes and constant iteration is happening with industrial products. Oden Technologies is a New York-based startup that builds sensor systems for factories, enabling continuous, precise monitoring of large and complex processes.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;One recent project involved building a tablet-based system for carrying out complex calculations in real time. The product, which might normally take six months to a year to create, was finished in 10 weeks, thanks to accelerated testing, and direct communication with the customer about needs and specifications during design and construction. In effect, over time the initial design and the prototype incrementally became the product, with the customer participating in its creation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The relationship with the customers tightens,&amp;#8221; said James Maidment, the team leader of the project. &amp;#8220;We deployed faster, we got new requirements directly, and we iterated more quickly. In a way, we don&amp;#8217;t have a final product, we have a customer relationship involved with a product.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;What else needs to change?&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The constant relationship between management theory and applied technology shouldn&amp;#8217;t be too surprising. William Hewlett, a founding father of Silicon Valley, famously said &amp;#8220;you cannot manage what you cannot measure.&amp;#8221; It seems to logically follow that opposite also holds true &amp;#8212; what and how you measure something influences the way it is managed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;How soon will cloud be as influential for management as the mainframe or client-server computing? &lt;a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w24001\"&gt;In a recent paper&lt;/a&gt;, Erik Brynjolfsson, Daniel Rock, and Chad Syverson found that major technology improvements may lag productivity gains for years, even decades. The most tantalizing reason why: An ecosystem of other changes has to arise, along with new thinking about how the technology should be used, in order for it to have full impact.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Brynjolfsson, a professor at MIT&amp;#8217;s Sloan School of Management, thinks software-based advances like AI and cloud-style software will find a place faster than many of the earlier advances. For one thing, lower costs mean they can be quickly adopted by startups unencumbered by legacy costs and practices. And, unlike hardware-based advances, the influence this time will be from software &amp;#8212; in particular, what happens when teams throughout the corporation build products and services using what is termed cloud-native software.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;With the cloud, we can replicate processes more quickly,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;But you still need three things to be updated before you fully take advantage: Organizational innovation, trained human capital, and social institutions, like infrastructure and regulation, that accommodate new technologies.&amp;#8221; He added, &amp;#8220;the biggest issue now is that important new technologies are moving ahead, and people aren&amp;#8217;t thinking enough about the big implications.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;The shift to &amp;#8220;cloud native&amp;#8221; organizations&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The way software is conceived of for cloud computing may turn out to be as important as the physical infrastructure of cloud (which is millions of computer servers dispersed around the globe, connected by high speed fiber optic lines.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Cloud native&amp;#8221; software approaches stresses ease of use and low-impact alteration of components of any given software application. Massive applications are subdivided into a series of &amp;#8220;microservices&amp;#8221; that can be tweaked with little effect on a running piece of software.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Traditional complex software often has a series of relationships, called dependencies, with other lines of code, requiring big rewrites for even trivial changes. Think of it as the way a plant&amp;#8217;s roots can grow over a big area, and intermingle with other roots. By orchestrating microservices into highly portable units, called containers, the dependencies are potted.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;That means it is possible to deploy and manage an application globally, from a single location, with relatively little hassle. Kubernetes, the most popular open source software for orchestrating such container usage, was originally developed inside Google to run the company&amp;#8217;s many global applications, and easily alter products and issue software fixes at the greatest possible scale.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Google now runs about 2 billion containers a week on its in-house version of Kubernetes. Open source Kubernetes is managed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, which counts among its members Google Cloud, Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Dan Kohn, the foundation&amp;#8217;s executive director, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;#38;v=C1g9qV1vwFI\"&gt;has predicted&lt;/a&gt; that eventually much the world&amp;#8217;s legacy software, worth about $100 trillion in net GDP, will be ported into Kubernetes, for better servicing.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Blackrock, the world&amp;#8217;s largest asset manager, recently built and released an investor research application using Kubernetes in 100 days, about the time it might normally take simply to procure computer equipment, on the cloud software it runs on its own computers. The team of 20 people represented technology, infrastructure, production operations, development and information security parts of the business.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Michael Francis, who led the project, noted how Kubernetes encouraged collaboration. &amp;#8220;I saw junior developers working directly with senior managers, asking what they were looking for,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;The feedback is much more rapid.&amp;#8221; In addition, there is less fear about taking on a big project, since the thousands of processes involved in a large software project can be transparently managed, and issues resolved quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes works well, in part, because it fits a larger ethos in cloud technology, flexibility. The computer server virtualization in cloud enables more workloads per machine, and sudden influxes of data can &amp;#8220;burst&amp;#8221; onto other machines, even in remote locations. Data and work can also be apportioned in smaller units and dispersed, either for security or to maximize resources. As customers of public clouds typically rent computation instead of buying assets, IT spending moves from a fixed capital commitment to a more flexible operating expense.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Pearson uses Kubernetes to develop, deploy and manage new kinds of online learning systems in developing markets like India and Mexico. About 10 products serve several hundred thousand students a month, and products are designed to fine-tuned all the time, as opposed to an older twice-yearly model.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It forces our internal teams to think about innovating faster,&amp;#8221; said Mr. Jackson. &amp;#8220;Conservatively, we can have 10 times more release activity. The software is designed to watch interactions with students, seeking ways to ensure they&amp;#8217;re learning, and this also requires closer consultation among product people, software developers, and IT executives like Mr. Jackson, who handle resource allocation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He calls it &amp;#8220;a redistribution of accountability&amp;#8221; with the organization, &amp;#8220;changing the perception of what IT is, when it becomes a value enabler.&amp;#8221; The new way of deploying software, he said, also gives him visibility on where and how it is consumed, providing information about future costs. That modifies his job from solely capital expenditure to operating expense, and effectively a collaborator on growth.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In 1967, still early days in the Information Technology revolution, John Culkin had a brilliant insight. &amp;#8220;We become what we behold,&amp;#8221; he wrote. &amp;#8220;We shape our tools and then our tools shape us.&amp;#8221; Five decades on, we have the benefit of much IT history, and can think how we, and our organizations may be shaped by new technology. As our systems and people gain in their capabilities to adapt to changing markets, every aspect of a business will become more responsive.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Fixed job roles, like software engineering or financial planning, may evolve towards domain knowledge, which is shared in collaborative teams, brought together and disassembled for some part of a product lifecycle. Companies may partner more deeply, taking advantage of each other&amp;#8217;s comparative advantage to meet a new market need. Managers will need to concentrate more than ever on skills such as collaboration, empathy, learning, and novel rewards to create an organization hopefully even more adaptive than the cloud computing IT tool it beholds.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=9yqfNC7BeVA:M2EjuUIsmvk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=9yqfNC7BeVA:M2EjuUIsmvk:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/harvardbusiness/~4/9yqfNC7BeVA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content><feedburner:origLink>https://hbr.org/2018/02/how-cloud-computing-is-changing-management</feedburner:origLink></entry></feed>\r\n",
