accurately, media reported.</p><p>The test included tens of thousands of 911 calls over the span of two months in several states in the US and had encouraging results, The Wall Street Journal reported late on Friday.</p><p>The 911 system, which turns 50 this month, has often struggled to locate cellphone callers. </p><p>Saving a minute in response times can save up to 10,000 lives a year, according to the federal regulators.</p><p>With the help of Google's new technology, about 80 per cent of the 911 calls could more accurately locate data within the first 30 seconds.</p><p>The tech giants' data also dramatically reduced the estimated radius of a call's location from 522 feet down to 121 feet and arrived faster than carrier data, the report said.</p><p>This improvment in tracing the location data can also help dispatchers in cases where the caller might not speak English, or in a state of panic, gives the wrong address. </p><p>The test, which included 50 call centres that cover around 2.4 million people in Texas, Tennessee and Florida, was done in conjunction with two companies that have connections into 911 centres, West Corp and RapidSOS. </p><p>For the test, Google sent location data from a random selection of 911 callers using Android phones straight to the people taking those calls. </p><p>Google's location technology is currently available in 14 countries, and the company

Gen. Amit Sharma, former Commander-in-chief, Strategic Forces Command and special address by Sunil Gupta, Secretary, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. ORF Chairman Sunjoy Joshi delivered the welcome address.</p><p>Prof. Suresh said ISRO is now working on building the heavy lift launch vehicle that can lift five to eight tonnes of payload. These vehicles will be backed by highly powerful Cryo Engine Cluster .</p><p>He said the future plans of heavy lift launch vehicles are designed to allow India to launch reusable vehicles, heavy platforms and human space missions.</p><p>Looking at the growing use of small satellites, India is also working on a small satellite launch vehicle also, Prof Suresh said.</p><p>ISRO is also working on to master recovery of the space capsule and developing a reusable launch vehicle that would reduce the cost and allow reuse of the vehicle.</p><p>Prof. Suresh said all of India's launch capabilities are in sync with the civilian programme, but not defence.</p><p>He noted that from a scratch in the 1980s, India's space launch capabilities have improved exponentially to launch 104 satellites in one go.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lt. Gen. V G Khandare, former Director General of Defence Intelligence Agency, delivering another spotlight address on 'Utilisaton of Space for Military Purpose: A roadmap for India', underlined the need for India to develop capabilities to launch heavier space assets, to match China's capabilities.</p><p>He felt that China has an edge over India with more satellites and launch centres.</p><p>He also said India has a long way to go, needs to learn from its adversaries and be able to use its space capability as a deterrent for war and conflict.</p><p>In the inaugural address, Lt. Gen Amit Sharma said while militarisation of space is very difficult to stop, India should take an active role in stopping the weaponisation of space.</p><p>He said right now, there is also no clear clarity on what kind of weapons are prohibited in the space, as the treaty talks of only weapons of mass destruction. \"Are kinetic weapons allowed? Are laser weapons allowed? Unfortunately, there is no clarity on these issues,\" he said.</p><p>Lt. Gen Sharma said with ISRO mastering the job of building satellites, this job should now be left to the private sector, and ISRO should concentrate on newer, tech-advanced areas.</p><p>He also stressed the need to build capability to look after the assets in space.</p><p>In his special address, TRAI Secretary Sunil Gupta said the open sky policies of his organisation is going to be further streamlined, noting that it believes in \"technology neutral\".</p><p>He also made it clear that the TRAI is against putting restrictions on foreign satellites just because they are foreign. \"That is not the right way. We have to see what role these satellites play,\" he said.</p><p>Gupta also underlined the need for making satellite clearances much easier.</p><p>ORF Chairman Sunjoy Joshi noted that while the Indian space programme is already 40 billion dollars, the world commercial space market stands at 380 billion dollars.  And it is expected to go up to at least 2.7 trillion dollars in the next three decades, according to Bank of America's Merrill Lynch.</p><p>Though the US holds more than 40% market share in this industry, the US successes has been coming not from NASA alone but from a dynamic, innovative private sector actively encouraged and promoted by NASA and the DOD, Joshi pointed out.</p><p>\"Goldman Sachs today calls space the next investment frontier. And as this new race heats up, there will as always have winners and losers. Some countries will race to encourage private companies to literally rocket the sector forward far more vigorously and swiftly than would be the case if left to governments alone. Others will struggle with the regulatory frameworks in this area,\" Joshi said.</p><p>The three-day conference will see top scientists, policy-makers, practitioners, and all other stake-holders debate various topics and issues.</p><p>The valedictory address will be delivered tomorrow by Dr. V K Saraswat, now NITI Aayog Member and a former Director General of the DRDO and Scientific Advisor to the Defence Minister.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/isro-technically-ready-for-human-space-missions-news-scitech-scqsKafaajjfg.html]]></link></item><item><guid><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/diamonds-real-estate-and-fixed-deposits-of-nirav-modi-under-ed-scanner-news-crime-scqkElabbjcee.html]]></guid><pubDate><![CDATA[Fri, 16 Feb 2018 14:30:35 +0530]]></pubDate><title><![CDATA[Diamonds, real estate, and fixed deposits of Nirav Modi under ED scanner]]></title><enclosure length=\"100\" type=\"image/*\" url=\"http://static.sify.com/cms/image/scpp6kbjgfbbc.jpg\"/><description><![CDATA[<img src=\"http://static.sify.com/cms/image/scpp6kbjgfbbc_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"900\" data-height=\"600\" data-title=\"Modi Choksi Nirav\"><font size=\"3\"> <b> Highlights: </b> <p> </p><ul><li>Enforcement Directorate acting upon PNB's FIRs.</li><li>Movable and Immovable assets valued at Rs 5100 crore seized</li><li>Raids on properties and offices in Mumbai and Delhi.

The bank in its two complaints has alleged that Modi and his accomplices siphoned off Rs 280 crore.

Not really. This is something which should come as a surprise to the cyber-savvy buyers of gadgets and gizmos.</p><p>A study from Google, published in 2012 but still relevant, says that 70 per cent of Indians decide about the brand and variant during an online search before going to a retail store.</p><p>Although the study was done in major cities and would have sampled a few people researching online before going shopping offline, both the parameters -- the number of people researching online as well as coming prepared with their choices -- must have gone up considerably by now, especially for a category like smartphones.</p><p>Smartphone sales haven't crossed 40 per cent through online channels in any of the best seasons so far in the country. There are still limitations to online channels in India.</p><p>ROPO (Research Online Purchase Offline) is no alien concept to the smartphone industry. This is an established trend how smartphones are purchased across the globe, including in India.</p><p>In 2017, one of the key focus areas for all emerging smartphone brands has been to expand offline (the latest example being Xiaomi which has a great online presence but is now trying to make inroads into the offline segment).</p><p>With smartphone purchases being mostly replacement or upgrades in nature, exposure to online research has increased, making ROPO impact even stronger in India.</p><p>In such a scenario, will the massive offline expansion plans help smartphone manufacturers?</p><p>The biggest challenge in the offline space would be to mirror the exact online availability of models. Online is just a catalogue, be it Flipkart or Amazon, and with a robust logistics back-end, a person can choose any model, variant and colour and that will be delivered as per the shipping policy, irrespective of from which warehouse the online seller has to deliver.</p><p>This is not going to be the case in offline. There are going to be situations, especially when a brand has several variants in specifications and colours, where the particular model and variant for which a buyer visits the store may not be available.</p><p>ROPO could efficiently be taken care of by handful of brands like Apple, Google and OnePlus, where the users are evolved, models and variants are few and inventory can be exactly mapped offline.</p><p>For other mass-market brands, it's going to be challenging. This becomes even more significant in a case where buyers tend to be impatient and would not want to visit the store again till the retailer arranges for the desired model and variant.</p><p>Streamlining the lag between availability of a new launch throughout the length and breadth of the country via offline is also going to be challenging to match the online expectations. This may eventually lead to a different connotation of ROPO with regard to the India market -- Recce Offline Purchase Online.</p><p>What usually stops someone researching online from clicking that 'Buy' button would be an interesting research to undertake.</p><p>As offline expands, should the online players like Flipkart and Amazon be worried? To a certain extent, because the brand that was so far enticing people to purchase online with discounts and other offers would not tell buyers to visit stores.</p><p>Creating smartphone experience zones also won't help much because it wouldn't make sense for someone to experience a smartphone offline and then buy it online.</p><p>What are the options for e-tailers like Flipkart and Amazon?</p><p>What they and others could do is to take the showcase right to the doorsteps. A prospective buyer can select a few models that are in his/her zone of consideration.</p><p>The delivery boy could be doubled up as a brand in-store promoter, answering queries from the buyer. For more technical queries, a video call could be initiated with the technical sales executives. Once the buyer is fully convinced, he or she may purchase the smartphone.</p><p>A single channel won't work for any brand. It has to be an omni-channel approach that is going to bring sales. However, as ROPO is triggering expansion into offline, the online mediums also have to look into reasons why the final call is not made in the cyber domain.</p><p><br></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/can-offline-expansion-bring-growth-for-smartphones-in-india-news-finance-scqmaejdbfbgi.html]]></link></item><item><guid><![CDATA[http://www.sify.com/finance/google-voice-assistant-sees-6-fold-growth-in-jiophones-news-smartphones-scqlEejdbhigg.html]]></guid><pubDate><![CDATA[Fri, 16 Feb 2018 12:23:23 +0530]]></pubDate><title><![CDATA[Google Voice Assistant sees 6-fold growth in JioPhones]]></title><enclosure length=\"100\" type=\"image/*\" url=\"http://static.sify.com/cms/image/rgjvGfjghdbgg.jpg\"/><description><![CDATA[<img src=\"http://static.sify.com/cms/image/rgjvGfjghdbgg_thumb.jpg\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"548\" data-title=\"Commuters are reflected on an advertisement of Reliance Industries' Jio telecoms unit, at a bus stop in Mumbai\"><font size=\"3\"> <p><b>New Delhi</b>: Google Voice Assistant that was made available in Reliance JioPhones in December 2017, has seen a six-fold growth in its usage, the company has announced.</p><p>In a move to empower feature phone users in the country, Google on December 5, announced to bring its Voice Assistant on Reliance JioPhone.</p><p>This was the first time that Voice Assistant was made available in any feature phone.</p><p>\"Since we launched the Google Assistant on the first feature phone in December, the Reliance JioPhones, usage of the Assistant in India has grown six times over the past four weeks,\" Caesar Sengupta, Vice President, Next Billion Users Team at Google, said in a blog post. </p><p>With Google Assistant, the next billion users are fast adopting cutting-edge technology \"astonishingly quickly\".</p><p>\"This isn't just due to many semi-literate or illiterate users, but also the fact that typing is difficult for people who never grew up with a computer keyboard,\" he mentioned. </p><p>There are estimates that web content is more than 50 per cent English.

For those of you interested in buying a smartphone that fits the bill, and provides decent aesthetics, this is the best that money can buy. </p><p> But readers have been posed with more confusion since there is subtle difference between Note 5 and the Note 5 Pro. </p><p> The specs and highlights on both devices are almost similar. <b>Here are highlights: </b></p><ul><li> Processor: Snapdragon 2 Ghz 625 SOC (Octa-core Processor) with Adreno 506 GPU</li><li> Display: 5.99-inch 18:9 resolution.
