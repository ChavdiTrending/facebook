Billed as &#8220;a multi-player submarine rogue-like set in a Verne-inspired underwater universe,&#8221; <em>We Need to go Deeper</em> places you and up to 3 other players in command of a submarine and charges you to work together to plumb the depths in search of riches and glory. </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not a simple matter of pointing and clicking however, as the various roles in the submarine &#8211; taking the helm, firing torpedoes, balancing power, patching leaks, and repelling tentacles &#8211; can&#8217;t be done all at once by a single player. That&#8217;s where your fellow crew members come in, each taking up a station in a frantic attempt at teamwork. As Deli Interactive explains, &#8220;<em>We Need to go Deeper</em> was created under the mindset of having friends scream at each other.&#8221; As your crew makes its way to the bottom, they will come across various caves scattered along the seafloor. Once a cave has been found, the action moves outside the submarine as the players don diving suits and explore the caves in search of gold and other rewards. All the while, both in the submarine and on foot, dangerous creatures of all sizes and shapes swarm and attack.</p>\n<p>Though it has only recently entered Early Access on Steam, <a href=\"http://www.weneedtogodeeper.com/\"><em>We Need to go Deeper</em></a> already offers a wonderful submarine odyssey that you can share with your friends. A lobby system even allows for you to join with strangers, and the developer has set up <a href=\"https://discordapp.com/invite/EFpZzaz\">a Discord server specifically for sole players looking for a crew</a>. </p>\n<p>If the promise of riches, teamwork, and/or painful death in the deep sea appeals to you, you can <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/307110\">grab a copy on Steam</a> or at <a href=\"http://www.weneedtogodeeper.com\">the game&#8217;s official website</a>!</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://www.tigsource.com/2017/02/18/dive-dive-dive-into-early-access-with-we-need-to-go-deeper/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>6</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>A Good Bundle &#8211; This is Fine</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.tigsource.com/2016/11/22/a-good-bundle-this-is-fine/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://www.tigsource.com/2016/11/22/a-good-bundle-this-is-fine/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2016 04:30:26 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Tof Eklund]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.tigsource.com/?p=27298</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[A Good Bundle is a rag-tag alliance of a great many indie game devs, from big dogs to folks with one smallish title to their name.

There are 151 games (&amp; tools) by 115 devs in here, and it&#8217;s all for charity: split 50/50 between Planned Parenthood and the ACLU.</p>\n<p>Tagline: &#8220;A Good Bundle is a bunch of creators sharing their works to combat some of the ugliness in our world.&#8221;</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-27298\"></span></p>\n<p>So, yeah, GamerGate&#8217;s going to be pissed. If you don&#8217;t believe me, scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page: the last game you&#8217;ll see is Zoe Quinn&#8217;s <em>Depression Quest</em>. Gods, I can&#8217;t wait for her collaboration with Chuck Tingle. &lt;3</p>\n<p><em>Depression Quest</em>, of course, is available free, as are a number of the other hundred or-so games in the $2 tier. A Good Bundle, and the folks contributing to it, are making a statement, if that wasn&#8217;t obvious already, and a show of unity.</p>\n<p>At the top of the ticket are a number of groundbreaking titles: you should already own <em>Proteus</em>, <em>Gone Home</em>, <em>The Novelist</em>, and <em>Read Only Memories</em>, but if <em>No Pineapple Left Behind</em>, <em>Catlateral Damage</em>, <em>Panoramical</em>, and/or <em>Sokobond</em> are on your wish list, or if you want to get in on the alpha for <em>Catacomb Kids</em>, giving $20 to charity is a pretty sweet deal. For that matter, if you only make games and don&#8217;t play them, all of GameappMaker Co.&#8217;s graphics extensions for Unity are there too.</p>\n<p>Go, play.

According to Ishi, Leilani&#8217;s Island draws some inspiration from the personality and physics of Wario Land and Donkey Kong Country, but in the animated gifs he&#8217;s posted Leilani promises to be even more intricate than the games from either of those series.

I liked that game.&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.tigsource.com/2009/10/30/hammerfight/\">Hammerfight</a>, released in 2009 by Russian game-maker Konstantin Koshutin, is an action game about piloting flying vehicles armed with medieval weapons like hammers, maces, flails, and swords as well as the occasional long-range cannon. Its dusty Steampunk world was beautifully rendered &#8211; bashing it out with mutant bugs and other pilots was often as lovely as it was brutal, with colorful faction banners streaming about and little people cheering you on in the background. I quite enjoyed knocking my enemies about, too, since a meaty hit could send someone&#8217;s airship smashing into a wall, with bricks flying everywhere. Unfortunately, the physics-based movement also took its toll on my poor wrists and constantly swinging my mouse around in circles became painful and repetitive after awhile.</p>\n<p>Koshutin&#8217;s newest project, Highfleet, seems to share some things in common with Hammerfight: mid-air duels in a dusty, lovingly-rendered world. Instead of floating ships with melee weapons, however, it looks as though you&#8217;ll be piloting more traditional aircraft and engaging in dogfights not dissimilar to Vlambeer&#8217;s Luftrausers (but slower-paced). From browsing the game&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/highfleet\">Facebook page</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/highfleetgame\">Twitter</a>, it looks like there will be a lot more to the game, too, like an overworld map and ship construction. Could be really cool (and a lot easier on my wrists).</p>\n<p>No release date for the game has been announced.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://www.tigsource.com/2016/07/18/preview-highfleet/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>4</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.tigsource.com/2016/07/07/momodora-reverie-under-the-moonlight/</link>\n\t\t<comments>https://www.tigsource.com/2016/07/07/momodora-reverie-under-the-moonlight/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 08 Jul 2016 05:38:41 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Derek Yu]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Highly Recommended]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Metroidvanias]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Platformers]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Steam]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Windows]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[rdein]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.tigsource.com/?p=27192</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[It&#8217;s become a joke to talk about Cave Story and Dark Souls when describing other games, but in the case of Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight, I&#8217;d be remiss not to: the series has never been shy about its influences.

In Reverie, the fourth game of the Momodora series, rdein has done a fantastic job joining the simple charm and tidy aesthetic of Daisuke Amaya&#8217;s little masterpiece with the methodical combat mechanics and level design of From Software&#8217;s Souls games. The result is something of a &#8220;perfect&#8221; Metroidvania, which feels neither meandering nor linear, frustrating nor dull. And it&#8217;s easy to see why rdein considers this to be his best-looking and most polished game yet: out of all the many beautiful animations and effects in the game, there&#8217;s not a single pixel that seems out of place.</p>\n<p>In this bustling age of indie game development, it can be refreshing to see a title that shows restraint in its design without being minimalist or abstract. You&#8217;ll love Reverie if you enjoyed any of its influences.

On the surface, the idea of moving direct control away from the fighting seems like a bad one, but it&#8217;s satisfying to see your training pay off as your character punches, kicks, and blocks on his own. Outside the ring, it&#8217;s all about efficient management of time and money &#8211; you want to spend each day training and sparring to improve your chances of winning, but your character also has to buy food and gym membership, which means taking on construction and pizza delivery jobs to make ends meet. Making things more difficult is the fact that your three main stats &#8211; strength, agility, and stamina &#8211; actually drop a little bit at the end of each day. Just like in real life, it takes sustained work to keep your physique in good shape.</p>\n<p>The biggest problem with Punch Club is the skill system. When I played the game, its three main build paths were very imbalanced. Initially, I went with a strength build, called the Way of the Bear, and found halfway through that I had hit a wall against the agile opponents whom the game heavily favors. The intent behind strength characters is that they get fewer opportunities to punch, but can end matches quickly if they can string some hits together. In practice, unless your agility stat is comparable to your opponent&#8217;s, you probably won&#8217;t land a hit at all. The Way of the Tiger, on the other hand, allows you to focus solely on agility and a little bit of stamina, learning counterattacks that use your opponent&#8217;s strength against them. The supposed weakness of agility &#8211; damage potential &#8211; ends up not feeling like a handicap at all. And the stamina-focused Way of the Turtle is apparently even harder to succeed with than Bear.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a shame, because the interplay between the resource management and fighting works well fundamentally. If you were given more interesting and well-balanced choices in terms of designing your character and his (or even her?) story, it could have found a permanent home on my phone (where I think this game is best-suited). As it is, one time through is enough for me.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://www.tigsource.com/2016/02/24/punch-club/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>5</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Dwarf Fortress 0.42.01: Taverns, Temples, and Troupes.

Troupes, mercenaries, refugees, scholars, and more will now visit your fort. Social interaction will also play a larger role so inns, taverns, and temples have been introduced as social areas. Libraries have also been added for more bookish individuals, collecting the various written works and technological advancements of the world.</p>\n<p>To aid in the new mingling scene, the inhabitants of your world will now compose <a href=\"http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/early_poetic_forms.html\" target=\"_blank\">poetry</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/early_musical_forms.html\" target=\"_blank\">music</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/early_dance_forms.html\" target=\"_blank\">dance forms</a>. While these are currently only described in text, the Dwarf Fortress community has already begun to provide some fantastic real-world interpretations from those descriptions (Listen:<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/mredrum/superior-rampart\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Superior Rampart</em></a>; Listen:<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/nethodsod/the-grasping-oaks\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Grasping Oaks</em></a>). Of course, these features are also available in the game&#8217;s Adventure Mode. Rather than running a fort, players can instead lead a performing troupe on a world tour!</p>\n<p>For a more complete changelog, and to download the latest version of Dwarf Fortress, <a href=\"http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/\">head on over to Bay 12 Games</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://www.tigsource.com/2015/12/01/dwarf-fortress-40-01-taverns-temples-and-troupes-oh-my/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>5</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n",
