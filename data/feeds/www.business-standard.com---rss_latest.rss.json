Three corruption cases were filed against 68-year-old Sharif and some of his family members on September 8 following a Supreme Court verdict that disqualified him as prime minister and ordered the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) for institution of cases against the PML-N leader.  The cases include Avenfield properties, Azizia & Hill Metal Establishment, and Flagship Investments.  In two suplementary references  one pertaining to Flagship Investments Limited and 15 other companies, and the other to Al-Azizia Steel Mills and Hill Metal Establishment  against Sharif and his sons, NAB said the total declared financial worth of assets of the accused persons as per their tax record in 2000-01 was Rs 50,940,870 and USD 64,984 (Rs 7.18 million), the Express Tribune
