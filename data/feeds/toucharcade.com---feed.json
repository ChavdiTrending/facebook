Now, before anyone goes over-thinking this, it doesn't necessarily mean our Game of the Week pick is the highest scoring game in a review, the game with the best graphics, or really any other quantifiable \"best\" thing. Instead, it's more just us picking out the single game out of the week's releases that we think is the most noteworthy, surprising, interesting, or really any other hard to describe quality that makes it worth having if you were just going to pick up <em>one</em>.</p>\n<p>These picks might be controversial, and that's OK. If you disagree with what we've chosen, let's try to use the comments of these articles to have conversations about what game is your game of the week and <strong>why</strong>.</p>\n<p>Without further ado\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h4 style=\"font-size: larger; border-bottom: 1px solid #BBB; font-weight: bold;\">Florence</h4>\n<p>I'm going to admit that I don't even know where to begin with <em>Florence</em> [<a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1297430468&mt=8\">$2.99</a>], the debut title from Mountains Games. It's difficult to put into words. <em>Florence</em> is a game, sure, but it's also more of an interactive story. It tells the tale of Florence Yeoh, a twenty-something young woman dealing with the doldrums of everyday life until she meets her first love, which changes everything. The thing about first loves though is that they're rarely the last. And so it goes as you follow Florence on her journey experiencing life and discovering who she is.</p>\n<p>So, ok. But so what? So is this a game or not? That's what's so fascinating to me. <em>Florence</em> could be a short animated movie, where you passively just sit back and watch it play out, and it would be great. The brilliance here is that it's NOT a passive experience on iOS, and that takes it from great to, well, brilliant. There's a lot of interaction happening throughout <em>Florence</em>, and it's almost entirely the simple, \"micro game\" variety but I can't overstate just how much that adds to the impact of the experience. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/696x696bb-2-2.png\"><img src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/696x696bb-2-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"278\" height=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230827\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/696x696bb-2-2.png 392w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/696x696bb-2-2-300x533.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px\" /></a> <a href=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/696x696bb-3-2.png\"><img src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/696x696bb-3-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"278\" height=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230828\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/696x696bb-3-2.png 392w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/696x696bb-3-2-300x533.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px\" /></a></p>\n<p>For example, when you're on your first date with your first love, the game represents the back and forth of each person's conversation as piecing together fragments of a speech bubble. In the early part of the date nerves are running high and Florence is feeling a little awkward, and the speech bubble pieces are more complex to put together. As the night goes on and both people become more comfortable with each other, the pieces become larger and much simpler shapes, until they're not pieces at all and instead are just one giant speech bubble.</p>\n<p>This is such a fun way of mimicking what it's like to click with another person on a romantic (or even a non-romantic) level. Things can be tricky at first as you try to force words together to make a sentence and carry on a conversation and hopefully not embarrass yourself in the process. But as you grow closer to that person the words just sort of come out naturally. This is really just one example of how \"gameplay\" helps capture a feeling and flesh out the characters in <em>Florence</em> in such an interesting way that's just not always possible in books or film.</p>\n<p>I should also add that there's almost NO text throughout the entire game. Amazingly, <em>Florence</em> is able to create real emotional connections and perfectly convey everything that's happening just by using the visuals, the tiny micro games you play, and by the <strong>absolutely phenomenal</strong> soundtrack. Seriously, don't even DARE play this without headphones or at least with your device's sound turned on. Just don't. It doesn't work without the full audio and visual experience. <em>Florence</em> is a very short ride too, clocking in between 30 minutes and an hour depending on how much you soak in each scene, so do yourself a favor and set aside some free time to fully absorb yourself into the game in one sitting. It's worth it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/696x696bb-4-2.png\"><img src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/696x696bb-4-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"278\" height=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230829\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/696x696bb-4-2.png 392w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/696x696bb-4-2-300x533.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px\" /></a> <a href=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/696x696bb-15.png\"><img src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/696x696bb-15.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"278\" height=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230830\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/696x696bb-15.png 392w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/696x696bb-15-300x533.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>Florence</em> certainly won't be for everyone, but as someone who enjoys artsy games like this I can safely say that that 30 minutes or so will be sticking with me forever, and three bucks for the feelings it gave me while playing feels like I committed a robbery. When people talk about using video games as a medium to tell stories like books or films do, <em>Florence</em> feels like the perfect example of what can be possible. It reminded me in many ways of Simogo's amazing <em>Device 6</em> [<a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=680366065&mt=8\">$3.99</a>] in that it wouldn't be possible to tell the same story or provide the same type of experience in a book or a film, and the interactions with the touchscreen and the way the visuals move with your own movements and guide you through the game provide an experience unlike any other. </p>\n<p>Know what you're going into with <em>Florence</em>, and <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/13/florence-review/\">our review</a> is a good place to start for a little more info, but if this type of thing is up your alley then by all means dive in and enjoy this short but ultimately impactful interactive story.</p>\n<p><strong>Link to Forum Discussion:</strong> <a href=\"http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?t=316899\">Florence (by Annapurna Interactive)</a></p>\n<p></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/16/toucharcade-game-of-the-week-florence/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>6</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>'Dice Brawl: Captain's League' Launching Next Tuesday and Up for Pre-Order Now, Here's a Sneak Peek</title>\n\t\t<link>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/16/dice-brawl-preview/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/16/dice-brawl-preview/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 00:00:09 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrew Fretz]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Upcoming Games]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Dice Brawl: Captain's League]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://toucharcade.com/?p=230767</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Idiocracy, Inc's Dice Brawl: Captain's League is coming next week to iOS.

This colorful free to play game is a swashbuckling adventure with some throwback art that is aiming to distinguish itself from some hefty competition. <em>Dice Brawl</em> is a 1v1 pvp game where you face off against a similarly experienced opponent in a pirate duel. You will construct and destroy buildings, cross swords with boss mobs as well as your opponent, and use a deck of cards to sway the fight in your favor.  As you progress in your career, you will unlock new cards and gain resources to upgrade your current cards. If you are familiar with <em>Clash Royale</em> [<a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1053012308&mt=8\">Free</a>], you basically already know how the card and deck system works. If you are not familiar with <em>Clash Royale</em>, welcome to 2018 and this is a mobile video game website, TouchArcade.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/DiceBrawl2.png\"><img src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/DiceBrawl2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"606\" height=\"299\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230771\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/DiceBrawl2.png 606w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/DiceBrawl2-300x148.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Whether you want to talk about <em>Clash Royale's</em> mass appeal, earnings, or involvement in eSports, there is always something going on with this mobile juggernaut. When it comes to games you may want to emulate, it's hard to find a game that brings the gacha income and competitive gravitas like Supercell's successful follow up on their <em>Clash of Clans</em> universe. Make no mistake, <em>Dice Brawl</em>'s deck management and acquisition system is very strictly modelled after <em>Clash Royale</em> and is definitely hoping to capitalize on the familiarity of that system. Where <em>Dice Brawl</em> is hoping to inject some originality is in the gameplay experience. Instead of a real time strategy-like environment with cards that go back into your hand after being used, <em>Dice Brawl</em> has a finite number of card uses and you'll be duking it out on a game board moving and fighting at the whim of dice rolls.</p>\n<p><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"343\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/LikCFoqrmKc\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:0; padding:0;\">\n<a HEREYES href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/toucharcade?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel</a>\n</div>\n\t\t</p>\n<p>We'll have a review out for <em>Dice Brawl</em> once it releases but in the meantime this is a game that definitely warrants keeping an eye on. The pirate theme, art style that is vaguely reminiscent of <em>Dragon's Lair</em>, and boardgame like gameplay are key points that we think will help this game escape the large shadow cast by the genre's founder and predecessor. You can currently pre-order <em>Dice Brawl</em> by <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dice-brawl-captains-league/id1286987058?mt=8\">clicking this link on an iOS 11 device</a>, if that's a thing you want to do, otherwise look for the full release next Tuesday, February 20th.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/16/dice-brawl-preview/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>What to Do in 'Dissidia Final Fantasy OO' After You've Beaten It</title>\n\t\t<link>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/16/dissidia-final-fantasy-oo-post-game-guide/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/16/dissidia-final-fantasy-oo-post-game-guide/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 22:30:14 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Nick Tylwalk]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Featured]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Free]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Guides]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iPad Games]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iPhone games]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Role-Playing]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://toucharcade.com/?p=230778</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[So you've made it all the way to the end of Dissidia Final Fantasy OO [Free].

First off, congratulations. That means you've watched a ton of cutscenes and battled your way through all five chapters of the story so far, undoubtedly tackling plenty of optional quests along the way. Nevertheless, there's probably some stirring in some corner of the gamer part of your soul, wondering if that's all there is (or maybe the regular part of your soul too, if you're the existential part). The answer is no, because not only is there\u00a0assuredly more to come on the story front\u00a0\u2014 and if you've beaten what the game has laid out to date, you know that there's nothing close to a resolution to its epic tale\u00a0\u2014 there's plenty to do while you wait for the developers to add more to the main quest line. If you want to keep playing, here's what you should be doing every day to make sure your characters are as well-prepared as they can be for what eventually lies ahead.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Play Story Chapters on Hard Mode</h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230803\" src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-hard-mode.jpg\" alt=\"Dissidia Final Fantasy OO\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-hard-mode.jpg 2048w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-hard-mode-300x225.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-hard-mode-768x576.jpg 768w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-hard-mode-620x465.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-hard-mode-624x468.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>What you get:</strong> Gems, crystals, XP for leveling</p>\n<p>While you may not have given it much thought at the time, beating any of the game's story chapters the first time unlocks a Hard difficulty setting that applies to all of the main and side quests therein. It's exactly what it sounds like, as all of the same battles are present, just with tougher enemies.</p>\n<p>It's worth your time to go back through all of them, as you can rack up more Gems by knocking out the mission goals in each fight. As well, Hard mode battles are good sources of base level crystals that you eventually run out of ways to gather as you get into the later chapters of the game's story mode but still need to make your characters stronger.</p>\n<p>Finally, Hard mode can be used to effectively level up some of the characters you don't use as often as your mains, keeping them at least somewhat usable for the new content coming down the pike, some of which is guaranteed to force you to use certain characters to max out on rewards as we've seen so far.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Tackle Character-Specific Events</h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230804\" src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-character-quests.jpg\" alt=\"Dissidia Final Fantasy OO\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-character-quests.jpg 2048w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-character-quests-300x225.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-character-quests-768x576.jpg 768w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-character-quests-620x465.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-character-quests-624x468.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>What you get:</strong> New allies you can't get through draws, 5-star armor, Gems</p>\n<p>Along with the daily cycle quests<em>, Dissidia Final Fantasy OO\u00a0</em>offers time-limited events based on a specific character. The first two introduced Squall (from <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em>) and Vanille (<em>Final Fantasy XIII</em>), and made it fairly easy to recruit them, requiring you to watch just two cutscenes and beat one level 10 quest. Easy peasy.</p>\n<p>They're even more rewarding if you keep playing, though, because they give you a chance to win two pieces of 5-star armor specifically for those characters: one for them to wear and another to level break the first one or give to another character, depending on your preference.</p>\n<p>Since these events are only around for a few weeks, you'll want to keep an eye on the Events tab daily to make sure you don't miss any.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Visit the World of Illusions</h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230805\" src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-world-of-illusions.jpg\" alt=\"Dissidia Final Fantasy OO\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-world-of-illusions.jpg 2048w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-world-of-illusions-300x225.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-world-of-illusions-768x576.jpg 768w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-world-of-illusions-620x465.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-world-of-illusions-624x468.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>What you get:</strong> Summon enhancement materials, Gems, draw tickets, double XP for specific characters</p>\n<p>The World of Illusions only opens up from time to time, so playing daily is the best way to ensure you don't miss out when it's available. The main draw for these quests is to provide enhancement materials to level up your Summons, which is valuable enough. But don't sleep on the Gems they provide either, as some of the quests give you as many as 500 Gems for your first clear.</p>\n<p>Another side benefit to each World of Illusions quest line is that it grants double XP to three different characters. So if you're looking for another way to level up heroes that aren't your mains, this is it\u00a0\u2014 just don't forget that these quests use Stamina Points (SP) that are connected to your overall player rank.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Grind Out Cycle Quests</h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230807\" src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-cycle-quests.jpg\" alt=\"Dissidia Final Fantasy OO\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-cycle-quests.jpg 2048w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-cycle-quests-300x225.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-cycle-quests-768x576.jpg 768w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-cycle-quests-620x465.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-cycle-quests-624x468.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>What you get:</strong> Crystals, Gems, Gil</p>\n<p>This is undoubtedly the least interesting endgame content at the moment, but it still serves a purpose. You're able to clear 10 Cycle Quests per day, which rotate between the different colors of crystals and one where Gil is the main objective.</p>\n<p>The current Cycle Quest schedule is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monday: Black crystals</li>\n<li>Tuesday: Red crystals</li>\n<li>Wednesday: Blue crystals</li>\n<li>Thursday: Green crystals</li>\n<li>Friday: Yellow crystals</li>\n<li>Saturday: White crystals</li>\n<li>Sunday: Gil</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don't feel like waiting? You can unlock any Cycle Quest for 30 minutes by using a Cycle Quest Key. If you run out of those, you can buy more using Dissidia Points. Just tap on the stylized 'D' icon on the game's home screen, and you'll see a pop-up window allowing you to exchange 100 Dissidia Points for one Cycle Quest Key.</p>\n<p>One more thing to remember about Cycle Quests is that while they focus on a particular color, you do earn smaller amounts of crystals of other colors while you clear them. So even if you are well-stocked with that day's color, it's not a bad idea to play your daily allotment of 10 quests regardless.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Team Up for Level 50 Co-Op Quests</h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230809\" src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-co-op.jpg\" alt=\"Dissidia Final Fantasy OO\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-co-op.jpg 2048w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-co-op-300x225.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-co-op-768x576.jpg 768w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-co-op-620x465.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-co-op-624x468.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>What you get:</strong> Gems, crystals, more</p>\n<p>For now, these are the ultimate <em>Dissidia Final Fantasy</em> endgame content. You can't take on a Level 50 Co-Op Quest solo even if you wanted to since the game doesn't give you the option, and you probably don't want to anyway.</p>\n<p>An interesting twist that goes along with these quests is that you can earn additional rewards based on your cumulative score from clearing the Level 50 Co-Op Quest repeatedly, regardless of whether you play as the host or a guest. Among the loot available for the first one, the Dragon of Death is additional Gems, support items, draw tickets and five-digit amounts of Gil.</p>\n<p>Don't forget that while Co-Op Quests use Link Bells to limit how often you play, only the Host uses one. You're free to join as a Guest as often as you like, and the cumulative rewards for Event Missions make it actually worth your while to do so as long as they are running.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Why You Should Be Saving Gems</h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230812\" src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-weekly-draw.jpg\" alt=\"Dissidia Final Fantasy OO\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-weekly-draw.jpg 2048w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-weekly-draw-300x225.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-weekly-draw-768x576.jpg 768w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-weekly-draw-620x465.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dissidia-ff-oo-endgame-weekly-draw-624x468.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /></p>\n<p>In any game with a gacha system like <em>Dissidia Final Fantasy OO</em>, it's tempting to just hit the store and spend your premium currency as soon as you get enough for whatever the best purchase might be. In this case, it's 5000 Gems to get 11 item draws, which is a good deal not only because you get one extra item (which would normally cost you 500 Gems or a draw ticket), but also because you are guaranteed a 5-star weapon.</p>\n<p>Yet there's still another dimension to it beyond that, which is that some of the event draws and weekly draws give you as high as a 90 percent chance of obtaining the 5-star weapon for one of three different characters. Until you have every character on your roster matched up with his or her specific 5-star weapon, that's a powerful incentive to stockpile Gems and spend them only when the draws that benefit you the most come around. It doesn't totally negate the gacha aspect of the game, obviously, but it does mitigate it when you spend wisely.</p>\n<p>Finally, something that only was added shortly before I wrote this guide is the addition of multiple 5-star weapons for some characters. For example, Cloud now has both the Crimson Edge and Ogrenix from <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> as options, both of which have different special abilities. That should be another factor in your mental calculus when deciding when and on what to spend your Gems.</p>\n<p>Still, if you take nothing else away from this entire endgame discussion, it's that there's currently no good reason not to wait until you have 5000 Gems before taking a shot on gear draws, and even after completing all of the game's story quests, there are plenty of opportunities to keep earning them daily to stockpile them for down the road.</p>\n<p></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/16/dissidia-final-fantasy-oo-post-game-guide/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>4</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>'Dragon Lapis' Review - Not Exactly a Gem</title>\n\t\t<link>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/16/dragon-lapis-review/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/16/dragon-lapis-review/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 20:30:22 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Shaun Musgrave]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[$4.99]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[3.5 stars]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Free]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Games]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iPad Games]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iPhone games]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Reviews]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Role-Playing]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Universal]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://toucharcade.com/?p=230763</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[On the one hand, Dragon Lapis [Free / $4.99] is a bog-standard Kemco RPG release, the sort they used to boot out the door on a near-monthly basis.

The only novel thing here is that the game is played in the portrait orientation rather than landscape, a change that makes it resemble Square Enix's iOS <em>Dragon Quest</em> games in what I'm sure is a total coincidence. On the other hand, Kemco hasn't been booting these kinds of games out the door on mobile quite as often as they used to. No one really is, if we're being honest. If nothing else, that makes <em>Dragon Lapis</em> slightly more welcome than it might have been had it dropped in the middle of Kemco's more prolific past.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-10-01.png\"><img src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-10-01.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"278\" height=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230793\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-10-01.png 1242w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-10-01-300x533.png 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-10-01-768x1365.png 768w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-10-01-576x1024.png 576w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-10-01-624x1109.png 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1242px) 100vw, 1242px\" /></a> <a href=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-22-31.png\"><img src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-22-31.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"278\" height=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230794\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-22-31.png 1242w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-22-31-300x533.png 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-22-31-768x1365.png 768w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-22-31-576x1024.png 576w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-22-31-624x1109.png 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1242px) 100vw, 1242px\" /></a></p>\n<p>This one comes to us by way of EXE-Create, seemingly the only developer left from Kemco's hay days that still has any desire to create games like these. The plot is trope-heavy, both in terms of general JRPG tropes and EXE-Create's usual efforts. In ancient times, two dragons battled each other in a terrible conflict that nearly tore the world apart. The two were sealed by a now-legendary hero, and the world went on in peace. Recent events have unsealed the dragons, however, and it's up the descendants of that legendary hero to either break the world or save it. You'll be playing the latter role, of course. As it turns out, one of the dragons was hiding in the humble hamlet the main character was defending, and when the other dragon comes knocking she is forced to reveal herself.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-04-23.png\"><img src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-04-23.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"220\" height=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-230796\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-04-23.png 1242w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-04-23-300x533.png 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-04-23-768x1365.png 768w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-04-23-576x1024.png 576w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-04-23-624x1109.png 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1242px) 100vw, 1242px\" /></a>For one of the most powerful beings in existence, she doesn't seem that bad. More mischievous than anything. She talks a big show about her frightful powers and god-like status, but she can't really back it up for most of the game. In order for the dragons to gain their full power, they need to gather up special gems called Dragon Lapis that are sealed in goddess statues around the world. Due to the nature of the seal, the dragons can't use their powers unless they are near a descendant of the legendary hero, which explains how you get dragged along on this business. You're joined by a down-on-his-luck mercenary and a young witch who has trouble asserting herself. We've seen all of these types of characters in EXE-Create's RPGs before, and they speak with similar voices to those party members of the past.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is the typical stuff in broad strokes. You travel from town to town solving problems that generally involve marching out to a dungeon and killing some sort of big boss. Beating monsters gets you experience points and money, both of which can be used to make your characters stronger. The former increases your level, improving your stats and giving you some valuable EP to spend on your job skills. The latter can be spent in towns to buy items and new gear. I probably don't need to explain all of this, but if Kemco is allowed to repeat as much as they do, I can surely get away with it as well. The battle system is the usual turn-based affair that EXE-Create uses in most of their games, right down to the speed-based turn order meter hanging out at the top of the screen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-19-09.jpg\"><img src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-19-09.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"220\" height=\"\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-230797\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-19-09.jpg 1242w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-19-09-300x533.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-19-09-768x1365.jpg 768w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-19-09-576x1024.jpg 576w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-14-19-09-624x1109.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1242px) 100vw, 1242px\" /></a>Character growth works a little differently in this one compared to some of the developer's other games. Many of your stat gains will come through special items called Growth Plates. These are small multi-node plates that are often connected with a particular job or weapon. Each node will unlock a stat gain, new ability, or rank-up in a job. When you finish the plate, you'll get an extra bonus for completion. Many of these abilities are fixed to certain jobs, but once you've unlocked a job you can switch to it freely whenever you'd like. There are a few jobs that are exclusive to particular characters, but for the most part you're free to make the hero a priest and the witch a warrior if that's your druthers. Besides affecting your stats and which learned abilities you have access to, your job also determines what equipment you can use.</p>\n<p>The Growth Plates can be found in chests or among drops from enemies. They're relatively easy to come across, particularly the ones that grow the basic classes. The EP to unlock the nodes, on the other hand, is a bit more limited. You'll get some when you level up, complete combat challenges the game randomly throws at you, or by using a fairly uncommon item. You can buy those items using premium points that are slowly earned through combat or bought with real money through the game's IAP shop. If you don't resort to buying those items, you're almost certainly going to have tons of plates you can't make use of. It's not a problem for general progress, but if you're the sort that gets bothered by having resources you can't use, you're probably going to be really irritated with it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-18-05-10.png\"><img src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-18-05-10.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"220\" height=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-230798\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-18-05-10.png 1242w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-18-05-10-300x533.png 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-18-05-10-768x1365.png 768w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-18-05-10-576x1024.png 576w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Photo-2018-02-16-18-05-10-624x1109.png 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1242px) 100vw, 1242px\" /></a>The IAP shop also sells the usual assortment of cheat items, and EXE-Create has also included their usual lottery system that gives you a chance to get some cool weapons, items, and accessories using free tickets or premium points. The EP items are included in the free lottery, and those tickets will sporadically drop from enemies, so there is at least a path to earning EP indefinitely so long as you are very patient. The shop also sells keys that are required to open certain treasure room doors. I didn't find any other way to get those keys in the game, but the treasure doesn't include anything terribly important and the keys are cheap enough to buy now and then with your earned premium points. Again, it's annoying but doesn't really affect your progress through the main story.</p>\n<p>In terms of presentation,<em> Dragon Lapis</em> follows the faux-retro style that EXE-Create introduced in <em>Dragon Sinker</em>, and even re-uses some of the enemy sprites from that game. With the novelty gone and the way the style breaks from the period it appears to be emulating in many ways, it ends up feeling like EXE-Create just didn't want to bother with high-res sprites and character portraits. It certainly doesn't feel like an 8-bit or 16-bit game in most respects. Still, I suppose it does the job well enough even if it isn't particularly exceptional or remarkable. One nice touch is that as you advance your job classes, your character's appearance changes in battle. That's a little extra bit of effort that we don't always see put into games with job systems. It's no<em> Final Fantasy 5</em>, but it's still appreciated.</p>\n<p>I also welcome the portrait orientation for whatever reason it was used. There aren't enough JRPGs on iOS that let you play this way, so I'm always happy to see one that does. The various options for virtual buttons don't quite hit the spot the way the <em>Dragon Quest</em> games from Square Enix do, but the options are at least there. Speaking of options, you can also buy this game in a premium or free form. The premium version takes out the in-game ads that you'll see in the free version and gives you a chunk of premium points to start with. In all other respects, the two apps are identical. If you can put up with the ads and don't care about the cheat items, you can play Dragon Lapis start to finish without paying a dime.</p>\n<p><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"343\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/TqzwxsvMTic\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:0; padding:0;\">\n<a HEREYES href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/toucharcade?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel</a>\n</div>\n\t\t</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this is a dance we've seen many times from Kemco and EXE-Create. You probably know what to expect from this pairing by now if you've been paying attention to the iOS JRPG scene at all, and perhaps don't really even need a review to know if you want to play the game or not. That being said, there aren't a lot of traditional single-player JRPGs being released on the App Store anymore, and while this one had the misfortune to drop on the same day as <em>Final Fantasy 15 Pocket Edition</em>, that doesn't necessarily mean that hungry mobile JRPG fans should ignore it. <em>Dragon Lapis</em> is a solid enough game that probably won't stick in your brain for very long but will at least keep you entertained for 20 hours or so.</p>\n<p></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/16/dragon-lapis-review/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Absurd Spear-Throwing Game 'Lichtspeer' Launching March 1st, Up for Pre-Order Now with 50% Discount</title>\n\t\t<link>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/16/lichtspeer-release-date/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/16/lichtspeer-release-date/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 19:15:34 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jared Nelson]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Upcoming Games]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Lichtspeer]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://toucharcade.com/?p=230779</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[It was just about a year ago that we sat down with the good folks from Noodlecake Games to check out four of their upcoming titles at GDC 2017.

While both <em>Invert</em> [<a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1220540830&mt=8\">$2.99</a>] and <em>Flipping Legend</em> [<a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1218046599&mt=8\">Free</a>] released in the time since then, we've still been kicking back waiting for both <em>Summer Catchers</em> and <em>Lichtspeer</em>. Well, after making a pit stop over on the Nintendo Switch with a special <em>Double Speer</em> co-op edition, <em>Lichtspeer</em> is finally ready to make its debut on iOS in just a couple of weeks. In case you're not familiar, <em>Lichtspeer</em> is a side-scrolling game that has your warrior throwing spears at all manner of enemies in an effort to continue progressing forward and eventually \"please the gods and restore balance to the universe.\" It's wrapped up in a psychedelic art style and over the top German stereotypes, as you can see in the latest trailer.</p>\n<p><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"343\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/V1uyTf2HJb0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:0; padding:0;\">\n<a HEREYES href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/toucharcade?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel</a>\n</div>\n\t\t</p>\n<p>Oh yes, I like that trailer very much. <em>Lichtspeer</em> will feature more than 60 levels filled with those wacky enemies and boss battles, and your characters will have 10 upgradeable \"lichtpowers\" to deal out damage to them. While <em>Lichtspeer's</em> official release date is March 1st, the game is actually up for pre-order right now at a discounted price. If you <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/app/lichtspeer/id1332743891?ls=1&mt=8\">click this link</a> on an iOS 11 device you'll be taken to the App Store where you can pre-order <em>Lichtspeer</em> for $1.99, 50% off its intended normal price of $3.99. Not bad, eh! If pre-ordering isn't your thing, then just hang tight for a couple of weeks and grab <em>Lichtspeer</em> when it arrives on iOS March 1st.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/16/lichtspeer-release-date/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>6</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>\u2018Pok\u00e9mon GO\u2019 Honors the Lunar New Year with a Safari Zone Event in Taiwan</title>\n\t\t<link>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/16/pokemon-go-lunar-new-year-safari/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/16/pokemon-go-lunar-new-year-safari/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Mikhail Madnani]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Free]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iPad Games]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iPhone games]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://toucharcade.com/?p=230766</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Pok\u00e9mon GO [Free] is gearing up for the Lunar New Year.

We're going to regularly post about important happenings in the Switch world, since we know a lot of you own the Switch to go along with your mobile devices. We'll be compiling new game and content announcements, new releases you need to know about, and the sales you need to keep track of. Without further ado:</p>\n<p><u><b><font size=\"+2\">Nintendo Switch news</font></b></u></p>\n<p><strong>Subsurface Circular releases on Switch on March 1st</strong></p>\n<p><em>Thomas Was Alone</em> developer Mike Bithell's third noteworthy game, <em>Subsurface Circular</em>, is going to hit the Switch on March 1st. It's described as a single-session story, the first in a series of  \"Bithell Shorts.\" It'll only cost you $5.99 to play it, and you could theoretically save a dollar by buying it on iPad for $4.99 right now, but then you can't play it on your Switch. I do wonder if <em>Volume</em> will ever hit the Switch...</p>\n<p><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"343\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/PuoAd3c8ZMw\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:0; padding:0;\">\n<a HEREYES href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/toucharcade?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel</a>\n</div>\n\t\t</p>\n<p><strong>New <em>Shaq Fu</em> coming to the Switch in spring with physical release</strong></p>\n<p>I don't know if the world really needed <em>Shaq Fu</em> to come back. Shaquille O'Neal's reputation somehow survived. Heck, it being so bad is why we remember it more than <em>Michael Jordan: Chaos in the Windy City</em>, I suppose. Regardless, we're getting <em>Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn</em>, which appears to be more of a side-scrolling beat 'em up starring the Big Diesel rather than a head-to-head fighting game. This hits the Switch and other platforms this spring. Saber Interactive, developer of <em>NBA Playground</em>, also says that anybody who bought that game on the Switch prior to June 10, 2017 will get <em>Shaq Fu</em> for free.</p>\n<p><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"343\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Dyc3eqrlOds\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:0; padding:0;\">\n<a HEREYES href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/toucharcade?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel</a>\n</div>\n\t\t</p>\n<p><u><b><font size=\"+2\">New Switch releases</font></b></u></p>\n<p><b><font size=\"+2\">Bayonetta 1 & 2</font></b></p>\n<p>Several of the Switch's titles in the first year are simply ports or adaptations of great Wii U games that need a new audience. <em>Bayonetta 2</em>, the Wii U exclusive sequel to Platinum Games' action game <em>Bayonetta</em>, sees a second life with a Switch release. The sequel in particular was really well-received. The games are $60 together, and the retail version comes with both games. but are available separately for $30 for the original <em>Bayonetta</em>, and $50 for the sequel, with discounts working out to where you can get both games for a combined $60 regardless of which game you buy first.</p>\n<p><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"343\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/BQNWORoYZXI\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:0; padding:0;\">\n<a HEREYES href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/toucharcade?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel</a>\n</div>\n\t\t</p>\n<p><b><font size=\"+2\">Fe</font></b></p>\n<p>While it looks like an indie game, this title got a publishing deal from EA, of all companies, as part of their EA Originals series. The game is a beautiful 3D adventure, where you splay as the eponymous fox creature, trying to sing to creatures to help save the forest they reside in from evil robotic creatures. While early reviews are not fully positive, the game looks like an amazing visual experience.</p>\n<p><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"343\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/rYX3CjSgE4c\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:0; padding:0;\">\n<a HEREYES href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/toucharcade?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel</a>\n</div>\n\t\t</p>\n<p><b><font size=\"+2\">Joe Dever's Lone Wolf</font></b></p>\n<p>The gamebook and action-RPG series makes its way to Switch after originally releasing on iOS and Android. It's not perfect, but it's got some good ideas going for it to make for an interesting experience, though the game is best experience in bite-sized chunks <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/2014/11/25/joe-devers-lone-wolf-review/\">according to our reviewer, Shaun Musgrave</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"343\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/QV2J3-SlDaI\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:0; padding:0;\">\n<a HEREYES href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/toucharcade?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel</a>\n</div>\n\t\t</p>\n<p><b><font size=\"+2\">Xeodrifter</font></b></p>\n<p>Atooi brings its Steam and 3DS Metroidvania to the Switch. This is a solid few hours of chunky pixel art action, where you do the requisite ability collection as you explore four different planets. The Metroidvania genre is rapidly expanding on the Switch with titles like this and <em>Dandara</em>. It's a solid platformer, especially if you like some of Atooi's other titles like <em>Mutant Mudds</em>, and I do like that high-speed running from <em>Super Metroid</em> is involved here. It's a solid little Metroidvania, and well apt for speedrunning.</p>\n<p><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"343\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/oEFcxOcehX0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:0; padding:0;\">\n<a HEREYES href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/toucharcade?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel</a>\n</div>\n\t\t</p>\n<p><b><font size=\"+2\">Dragon Quest Builders</font></b></p>\n<p>Do you really need another <em>Minecraft</em> clone in your life? Well, the difference here is that there's a major singleplayer campaign to go along with all the creative stuff. That's the thing about <em>Minecraft</em>, it requires a lot of self-direction, or at least the inspiration to go and do something, perhaps in one of the game's many mods. But here, you can enjoy a singleplayer title in the blocky aesthetic, and then play through the Terra Incognita creative mode if your heart desires. There is a demo if you're curious, and a sequel is set to release later this year.</p>\n<p><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"343\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/MKIBurRvtzs\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:0; padding:0;\">\n<a HEREYES href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/toucharcade?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel</a>\n</div>\n\t\t</p>\n<p><b><font size=\"+2\">Owlboy</font></b></p>\n<p>Want to know why this title was so hyped to the point of getting the ultimate tribute: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/arbys/status/793467663041241089\">an Arby's tweet</a>? Just look at that pixel art. Have mercy. If you played <em>Savant: Ascent</em> and wanted more of that kind of art, you'll love what <em>Owlboy</em> has going on. The game was in development for well over a decade, and saw a full release in 2016, with the Switch now getting the game. It's only appropriate for a platformer that draws from the golden age of pixel art to be on a Nintendo system.</p>\n<p><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"343\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/dutS-F6amrE\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:0; padding:0;\">\n<a HEREYES href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/toucharcade?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel</a>\n</div>\n\t\t</p>\n<p><u><b><font size=\"+2\">Noteworthy games on sale</font></b></u></p>\n<p><b><font size=\"+2\">NBA 2K18</font></b></p>\n<p>(Base edition on sale for $38.99 from $59.99 until the 20th) This has become the premier basketball series by far, and is definitely challenging Madden's long-running sports game dominance, thanks in part to the game's custom player mode. That has expanded to such a degree that people are now playing 5-on-5 matches online with their custom characters, and there's even an esports league, the NBA 2K League, in the works. Qualification is underway for that, and the Switch version isn't being played professionally right now, but maybe next year it will? Maybe your esports career starts here. First step: get a microSD card so you can install the game.</p>\n<p><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"343\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/lwBqitrE3ww\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:0; padding:0;\">\n<a HEREYES href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/toucharcade?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel</a>\n</div>\n\t\t</p>\n<p><b><font size=\"+2\">Retro City Rampage DX</font></b></p>\n<p>($9.99 from $14.99, sale ends on the 22nd) Never played this one on any platform, ever? It's on pretty much every platform in existence, and now the Switch too! If you love 1980s references, you'll love this, and there's plenty of gratuitous pixel violence to enjoy as well.</p>\n<p><b><font size=\"+2\">Battle Chef Brigade</font></b></p>\n<p>($17.99 from $19.99, sale ends on the 19th) - It's not a huge discount, but if you're curious to try this fantasy take on competitive cooking from the makers of <em>Color Sheep</em>, well, this is a good chance! The artwork by Eric Huang is absurdly good, and the entire game looks like a hand-drawn painting. </p>\n<p><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"343\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/aZjt0LBipi4\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:0; padding:0;\">\n<a HEREYES href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/toucharcade?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel</a>\n</div>\n\t\t</p>\n<p><b><font size=\"+2\">Axiom Verge</font></b></p>\n<p>($13.99 from $19.99, sale ends on the 22nd) This is <strong>the</strong> Metroidvania that you need to play if you haven't done so. The game definitely skews more <em>Metroid</em> than <em>Castlevania</em> in its art and gameplay. It's more than just a <em>Metroid</em> homage, though: the game definitely makes its own mark on the genre with its design choices, and the soundtrack is quite the unique piece of work. Game developers should play this to know how to perfectly straddle the line between homage and creating a new work that stands on its own merits.</p>\n<p><b><font size=\"+2\">Jackbox Party Pack 4</font></b></p>\n<p>($19.99 from $34.99, sale ends on the 22nd) I love that the makers of the <em>You Don't Know Jack</em> trivia game series from a couple decades ago are not only surviving, but thriving as we get dangerously close to 2020. The <em>Jackbox Party Pack</em> games include a bunch of ridiculous party titles that involve trivia, creatively changing what your opponents say, and more. Everyone gets to play with their phones, so nobody has to touch your Switch. And, you don't have to be near TV now to play these games! This pack on sale is a great starting point for the series. Friends not included.</p>\n<p><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"343\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/uo1WXgBe0rA\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:0; padding:0;\">\n<a HEREYES href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/toucharcade?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel</a>\n</div>\n\t\t</p>\n<p>We want to hear your thoughts and feedback on Switch coverage here on TouchArcade!

Yes <em>Rocket League</em>, the giant-soccer-played-with-cars game which feels like it's on every single platform BUT mobile, is a bonafide smash hit. Now Psyonix is looking to build off their partnership with Mattel and their Hot Wheels brand that saw Hot Wheels cars and cosmetic items added into the game early last year. This time around they're bringing things out of the digital world and into the real world with a <em>Rocket League</em> branded RC car set and play arena. Here's a mockup of what that might look like.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/RL-HW-Standee-V.3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/RL-HW-Standee-V.3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1295\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230751\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/RL-HW-Standee-V.3.jpg 1000w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/RL-HW-Standee-V.3-300x389.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/RL-HW-Standee-V.3-768x995.jpg 768w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/RL-HW-Standee-V.3-620x803.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/RL-HW-Standee-V.3-624x808.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a></p>\n<p>So if <em>Rocket League</em> isn't on mobile why am I talking about this here? Because those little RC cars will be controlled via Bluetooth using your smartphone or tablet. The set will include a little charging base for charging each vehicle as well as a ball equipped with IR sensors so it can keep track of the score whenever it's knocked into one of the goals. Honestly I just want the cars to drive around with using my iPhone, but mimicking the arena of <em>Rocket League</em> is pretty cool too. It's not going to come cheap though, as the set, which is officially called the Hot Wheels Rocket League RC Rivals Set, will cost $179.99 when it arrives this holiday season. In addition, the set will include codes for downloading special in-game items in <em>Rocket League</em>, so that's some added value I guess? </p>\n<p>The set will be shown off this weekend during the New York Toy Fair 2018 so I'm hoping to see what the actual cars are like in action. What do you think, too rich for your blood? Or do you love <em>Rocket League</em> enough that you've <strong>gotta have it</strong> no matter the price?</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/15/rocket-league-hot-wheels-rc-cars/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>2</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Heavy Story-Driven Exploration Game 'Keep in Mind: Remastered' Coming to iOS, Android, and Steam March 8th</title>\n\t\t<link>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/15/keep-in-mind-remastered-release-date/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/15/keep-in-mind-remastered-release-date/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 00:00:16 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jared Nelson]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Upcoming Games]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Keep in Mind: Remastered]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://toucharcade.com/?p=230744</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[While video games are typically lighthearted, fun escapes from reality, sometimes games can attempt to tackle more serious issues and serve to make players think and reflect on something rather than escape it.

This has been even more common in the past few years with the openness of digital marketplaces and the explosion of the indie developer scene. One such game that tackles some tough issues, specifically alcoholism and mental illness, is called <em>Keep in Mind</em> from Little Moth Games. The story follows Jonas, who suffers from alcholism and mental illnesses like depression and grief, as he awakes one night in a strange alternate version of his world and must go on to face the darkest demons of his psyche. Here's the latest trailer.</p>\n<p><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"343\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/jj20G1owZFs\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:0; padding:0;\">\n<a HEREYES href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/toucharcade?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel</a>\n</div>\n\t\t</p>\n<p><em>Keep in Mind</em> originally released back in 2016 as a browser game, but Little Moth has partnered up with Akupara Games to re-release the game as <em>Keep in Mind: Remastered</em> on iOS, Android, and Steam on March 8th. The game is most certainly not a long experience, and can be completed in a half hour or so, but the hope is that the impact of the characters and story will help players deal with their own issues, or at least open their eyes to them. One very cool thing about this new release is that the developers will be donating all the game's profits to the <a href=\"http://childsplaycharity.org\">Child's Play Charity</a>. While it's maybe not as \"fun\" playing games that deal with these serious issues, I'm glad that the medium of video games can branch out into these areas and create awareness and even help people cope through their own problems. If <em>Keep in Mind: Remastered</em> looks interesting to you, then check it out when it launches on March 8th. </p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/15/keep-in-mind-remastered-release-date/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>These New 'Witcheye' Gifs are Getting Me Pretty Excited</title>\n\t\t<link>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/15/witcheye-new-gifs/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/15/witcheye-new-gifs/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 22:30:59 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jared Nelson]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Upcoming Games]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Witcheye]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://toucharcade.com/?p=230738</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Back at the beginning of December we posted about a very cool upcoming game called Witcheye from indie developer Peter Malamud Smith which was sort of a throwback NES-style platformer about a witch who could transform into a flying eyeball.

You know, normal stuff. While Smith had previously released the clever puzzle/avoidance game <em>Sattelina</em> [<a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=951178649&mt=8\">$1.99</a>] and its spinoff <em>Satellina Zero</em> [<a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1086476832&mt=8\">Free</a>] on iOS, he was also part of the team that created the very well-received \"lost\" NES game <em>The Great Gatsby</em> back in 2011, which you can <a href=\"http://greatgatsbygame.com\">play in Flash in your browser</a>. <em>The Great Gatsby</em> felt about as authentic of an NES game as you could get without having it actually be from the NES era, and that's relevant to this discussion as <em>Witcheye</em> is going for that same authentic feel. We hadn't really heard much about <em>Witcheye</em> since that original post, but responding to a progress update query Smith swooped into our upcoming forums like a flying eyeball and posted many new animated gifs of <em>Witcheye</em> in action. Enjoy!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://imageshack.com/a/img924/4250/D9Xs7J.gif\" width=\"638\" height=\"360\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://imageshack.com/a/img924/2003/YgtitR.gif\" width=\"638\" height=\"358\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://imageshack.com/a/img922/5356/qRNxiz.gif\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></p>\n<p>That's just a few examples of the latest look at <em>Witcheye</em>, and you can see many more as well as about a dozen of the original gifs from December if you <a href=\"http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?t=314748\">drop on by the game's forum thread</a>. The game is looking so good I just want to post ALL THE GIFS all in a row right here and now, but I'd feel bad for crashing everyone's browsers. Unfortunately <em>Witcheye</em> doesn't have a firm release date beyond some point in 2018, but maybe if we all ask real nicely and post our enthusiasm for the game in the forum thread that will light a fire under our dear Peter Malamud Smith's behind and get this thing finished up sooner rather than later.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/15/witcheye-new-gifs/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Gamevice Just Launched a $89.95 'Minecraft' Bundle</title>\n\t\t<link>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/15/gamevice-just-launched-a-89-95-minecraft-bundle/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/15/gamevice-just-launched-a-89-95-minecraft-bundle/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 21:00:08 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Eli Hodapp]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://toucharcade.com/?p=230730</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Late last year we posted about a somewhat surprising bundle that popped up on the Apple Store which featured a SteelSeries Nimbus MFi Controller and Minecraft: Apple TV Edition.

(We also <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/2015/11/02/gamevice-for-ipad-mini-hardware-review/\">reviewed</a> an even earlier unit for the iPad mini.) Basically, it's an expandable controller that clips your iOS device in the middle, ending up with an arrangement that's sort of like the Switch. (Amusingly enough, they're <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/2017/08/11/will-nintendo-switch-sales-be-hindered-by-gamevice-lawsuit/\">also suing Nintendo</a>.)</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PRIMARY-GV157-i7P-Front-Angle-MC-Chatacters-min_1024x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-230735\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PRIMARY-GV157-i7P-Front-Angle-MC-Chatacters-min_1024x1024.png 1024w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PRIMARY-GV157-i7P-Front-Angle-MC-Chatacters-min_1024x1024-150x150.png 150w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PRIMARY-GV157-i7P-Front-Angle-MC-Chatacters-min_1024x1024-300x300.png 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PRIMARY-GV157-i7P-Front-Angle-MC-Chatacters-min_1024x1024-768x768.png 768w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PRIMARY-GV157-i7P-Front-Angle-MC-Chatacters-min_1024x1024-620x620.png 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PRIMARY-GV157-i7P-Front-Angle-MC-Chatacters-min_1024x1024-624x624.png 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>If you're curious what other games (besides <em>Minecraft</em>) you can play with MFi controllers, the <em>Gamevice Live</em> [<a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=988584664&mt=8\">Free</a>] app does a great job at aggregating all of them.

When Amazon Web Services had a massive five-hour outage last year it seemed like it took half the internet with it. This afternoon, Google is experiencing issues with Google Cloud, and most (if not all) games and apps that utilize their cloud services are down. This includes <em>Pokemon Go</em> [<a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1094591345&mt=8\">Free</a>], <em>Fire Emblem Heroes</em> [<a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1181774280&mt=8\">Free</a>] and even parts of <em>Snapchat</em> [<a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=447188370&mt=8\">Free</a>].</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/gcphero.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"770\" height=\"385\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-230732\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/gcphero.jpg 770w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/gcphero-300x150.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/gcphero-768x384.jpg 768w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/gcphero-620x310.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/gcphero-480x240.jpg 480w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/gcphero-524x262.jpg 524w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/gcphero-624x312.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></p>\n<p>It's hard to say how long Google Cloud will be having issues, but <em>any</em> sort of significant downtime like this from these massive cloud providers is very abnormal. If your favorite online games and other services aren't working how they usually do this afternoon, chances are everything will be fine as soon as Google fixes things on their end.

It's also the kind of thing that's going to make you sometimes want to throw your smartphone against a wall in frustration.</p>\n<p>To try to ease such stress and save you from diving into the in-app purchases, here are some tips on how best to tackle <em>Mad Skills BMX 2</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230707\" src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/madskills6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1334\" height=\"750\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/madskills6.jpg 1334w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/madskills6-300x169.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/madskills6-768x432.jpg 768w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/madskills6-620x349.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/madskills6-624x351.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1334px) 100vw, 1334px\" /></h3>\n<h3>Treat It Like a Rhythm Game</h3>\n<p><em>Mad Skills BMX 2</em> might look like a racing game but it owes more to the concepts of rhythm action than a regular racing title. Treat it accordingly. Get into the rhythm.</p>\n<p>Always hold down the down arrow when going downhill or on any form of rolling hill, before jumping up to hit the big hills. Soaring through the air? Force your bike back down with the down arrow once more but time it so that you hit the slope at just the right angle to build up some speed. It's all about timing your button presses more so than worrying about the balance of your bike. Don't treat <em>Mad Skills BMX 2</em> like a <em>Trials</em> game, it's completely different.</p>\n<p>As soon as you've stopped going downhill, release the down arrow and come out of your crouch. Don't leave it a second longer than you have to. The more you do this, the more you'll find yourself instinctively reacting correctly. Thinking less does have its advantages.</p>\n<p>Jumping is perfect if you manage to land on a downhill slope so time when you force yourself back down to get the optimal angle. That way, you'll gain more speed. Treat it like a rollercoaster ride but with an aim to keep as low to the ground as possible. After all, you can't pedal furiously if you're not on the ground to start with.</p>\n<p>If you've messed up the timing at any point, it's easy to fall behind your opponent by quite a distance. Hit the restart button and retry. Very rarely can you make up any more than a split second difference between the two of you. This isn't a forgiving game by any means. Work on memorizing the leaps and hills of each track, and expect to have to replay them a few times to nail them.</p>\n<p>There are no tilt buttons for tweaking your positioning so just focus on the main two buttons and directions. <em>Mad Skills BMX 2</em> isn't as physics rich as some bike racing games, so you can just work on your timing rather than landing awkwardly. At least, that is, until you're performing tricks.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230710\" src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/madskills3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1334\" height=\"750\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/madskills3.jpg 1334w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/madskills3-300x169.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/madskills3-768x432.jpg 768w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/madskills3-620x349.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/madskills3-624x351.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1334px) 100vw, 1334px\" /></h3>\n<h3>Tricks</h3>\n<p>When racing, you'll notice your AI opponent tends to perform tricks while taking big jumps. Don't copy him. It's generally not worth it as it'll just waste time. Focus on holding down that down arrow so you make your way down to the ground faster.</p>\n<p>Performed a trick anyhow? Make sure you land correctly. Do so and you'll maintain your current speed. Wipe out and, well, what do you think will happen? Exactly.</p>\n<p>There is an exception to this rule - later stages have you needing to perform specific tricks and stunts. Obviously, in this case, work on those tricks. Anything that's a general race though - it's just not worth wasting your time with. Stick with speed over style.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Work on Defeating Shrimp Quickly</h3>\n<p>Shrimp is the first boss you'll come across and he's not actually that tough. By the time you get to him, you'll have earned plenty of cash to upgrade your starter bike fully. Once you take him on, just work on your timing and he won't be much of a challenge.</p>\n<p>Along the way, you'll almost certainly have leveled up to level 3 which gives you 10 rockets for free. These are premium power-ups that give you a hefty speed boost during a race. It's tempting to use one while dueling Shrimp, but don't bother. There are far more difficult races ahead and Shrimp isn't a big challenge if you've got into the rhythm of the game.</p>\n<p>When you do come to use a rocket, remember that it isn't a 'Get out of Jail free' card. It'll help you but it's no magical fix so you're still going to have to get your timing right and ensure you can close the gap on your opponent. In particular, if your opponent is off screen, you're never going to be able to catch them. Even with a rocket.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230708\" src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/madskills5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1334\" height=\"750\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/madskills5.jpg 1334w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/madskills5-300x169.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/madskills5-768x432.jpg 768w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/madskills5-620x349.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/madskills5-624x351.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1334px) 100vw, 1334px\" /></h3>\n<h3>General Advice</h3>\n<p>Don't be afraid to take a break for a bit. If you've been consistently tested by a track and just can't beat it, a breather can make a big difference. Kind of like with a lot of puzzle games, it gives your brain to catch up and work out a better approach. Brute force isn't always the solution.</p>\n<p>Upgrade as often as possible. Each upgrade is pretty pricey but it'll make a significant difference to your performance. Just don't expect to be able to do it very often.</p>\n<p>As often as possible, replay past completed tracks via the Time Attack mode. You'll earn a few bucks that way with even more offered to you if you watch an advert straight afterwards. It's a quick and easy way of upping your cash for minimal effort.</p>\n<p>Typically, this is your only route to buying new bikes. Simply completing the tracks available doesn't automatically give you enough cash to buy a new bike. <em>Mad Skills BMX 2</em> isn't geared that way. Instead, you're going to have to replay earlier stages or use the game's quick race mode to pick up some extra cash. On the plus side, there's no energy system to limit how often you do this. You can replay stages as much as you want.</p>\n<p>Bear in mind though, that you can only watch so many video ads before waiting a few hours for them to refresh.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230711\" src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/madskills2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1334\" height=\"750\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/madskills2.jpg 1334w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/madskills2-300x169.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/madskills2-768x432.jpg 768w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/madskills2-620x349.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/madskills2-624x351.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1334px) 100vw, 1334px\" /></p>\n<p>Returning to the Forest Stages right at the start is a great place to go. Odds are your previous times have been pretty lousy while you were learning the game, making them rich for improvement. They're also great if you're trying to adjust to a new bike, or you're learning new tricks for later stages that require a certain number of flips.</p>\n<p>Treat the Forest Stages like your training grounds, and you'll reap the benefits.</p>\n<p>Never use your rocket boost when replaying a stage in Time Attack. It's the biggest waste of one of the rarer resources you'll come across. Just work on practicing your methods and see it as a form of training for harder stages.</p>\n<p>Don't waste gold on buying new clothes or repainting your bike. These won't boost your speed. They're just there to look cool. If you're going to spend cash or gold, use it on things like buying a new bike or buying some extra rockets. Not that you're relying on those rockets too much, right?</p>\n<p>Treat everything like a practice run. <em>Mad Skills BMX 2</em> is the perfect example of 'practice makes perfect' as you'll find whenever shaving off precious milliseconds from past sessions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n<div style=\"background: #393949;padding: 20px;line-height: 1em;width: 80%;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #f2a200;font-weight: bold;font-size: 24pt\">\ud83e\udd14 Like this article?</span><span style=\"color: white;line-height: 21px\">We pride ourselves on delivering quality, long-form articles like this one instead of the SEO-driven click bait that is slowly taking over the internet.

That being the case,\u00a0<em>Portal Knights\u00a0</em>[<a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=881900496&mt=8\">$4.99</a>] must really want you to like it, because its brand new Adventurer's Update loads it up with new features and new ways to play.</p>\n<p>For starters, the update helps solve one of the most annoying parts of<em> Portal Knights</em> by introducing relocatable NPCs. Sure, you can zip between islands using portals since that's kind of the point of the game, but why be bothered to even do that when you can simply bring the NPC back to your own island and buy stuff from them right there? Homes can also now house pets, because everyone loves those, and cool mannequins to show off your weapons and armor.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230694\" src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/portal-knights-mannequins.jpg\" alt=\"Portal Knights\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/portal-knights-mannequins.jpg 1920w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/portal-knights-mannequins-300x169.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/portal-knights-mannequins-768x432.jpg 768w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/portal-knights-mannequins-620x349.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/portal-knights-mannequins-624x351.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In terms of new content, you can seek out Fort Finch to meet new characters and undertake new quests. Along with interesting new building items like drawbridges, water pumps and drains, there are a host of additional weapons\u00a0\u2014 more than 20 across all classes, some of which have cool special abilities. Some of the new loot can only be found deep underground, in what the devs are calling \"the deepest, darkest corners of dungeons.\" Scary!</p>\n<p>And there are what you might call quality of life improvements, if you were satisfied with using the same boring phrase that every update tends to lean on. The combat system has been given some\u00a0interesting additions, like being able to do extra damage when hitting enemies from behind. Sleeping through the night allows you to avoid the spawns that come out when the sun is down on some (read: most) islands, a tactic that has served <em>Minecraft</em> players well for years. Perhaps most welcome of all for us mobile gamers is controller support, as there are definitely times the combat in <em>Portal Knights</em> simply seems a little too hectic for the standard touch controls.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230691\" src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/portal-knights-bed.jpg\" alt=\"Portal Knights\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/portal-knights-bed.jpg 1920w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/portal-knights-bed-300x169.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/portal-knights-bed-768x432.jpg 768w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/portal-knights-bed-620x349.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/portal-knights-bed-624x351.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /></p>\n<p>Along with the update, an in-game event to celebrate Chinese New Year is running now through March 5. If you can help the Emperor with his problems, you'll earn items themed for the Spring Festival, new pets like pandas and dragons (those check the Chinese New Year boxes alright) and maybe, just maybe, unlock a new themed island to go with all the ones you've already explored.</p>\n<p>Alas, one of the cooler sounding new features, the ability to create password-protected private servers and thus avoid playing with randos is only available to PC gamers. So we can't have everything, but at least you're now going to be less likely than ever to say, \"There's nothing to do, I'm bored\" while playing <em>Portal Knights</em>, and instead will have to watch out for the paradox of choice. I can think of worse fates.</p>\n<p></p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/15/portal-knights-adventurers-update/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>5</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Share Your 'The Battle of Polytopia' Online Multiplayer Player IDs Here</title>\n\t\t<link>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/15/share-your-the-battle-of-polytopia-online-multiplayer-player-ids-here/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://toucharcade.com/2018/02/15/share-your-the-battle-of-polytopia-online-multiplayer-player-ids-here/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 16:00:12 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Mikhail Madnani]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Free]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iPad Games]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[iPhone games]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://toucharcade.com/?p=230718</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Midjiwan\u2019s The Battle of Polytopia [Free] has quite the cult following.

I only started playing it after a friend constantly spoke about how well it played which was surprising given the genre. <em>The Battle of Polytopia</em> is one of the most approachable turn based strategy games out there.

For one, the online multiplayer games support up to 12 players in each game. Android and iOS users can play together. This update also includes an updated interface and iPhone X support in addition to full resolution support on all devices.</p>\n<p>Midjiwan says that this is the first take on multiplayer in <em>Polytopia</em> and there will be more cool stuff added in the future. The multiplayer mode here is free for anyone who has bought a paid tribe in game. If you haven\u2019t, you\u2019re prompted to buy one if you try and access the online multiplayer here.

After updating <em>Ghost Trick</em> for iOS 11 and iPhone X, Capcom has a big spring sale on for <em>Monster Hunter Freedom Unite</em>. Capcom\u2019s <em>Monster Hunter</em> franchise has been across multiple systems over the years. I got into the franchise on the 3DS but always wanted to play the older games as well. When <em>Monster Hunter Freedom Unite</em> [<a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=744769918&mt=8\">$3.99</a>] released on iOS, it was a no brainer purchase. It is now down to just $3.99 from $14.99 on the App Store which is 74% off and the historic lowest price for this game. It is also a fully premium release with no hidden costs or in app purchases. <em>Freedom Unite</em> is actually an enhanced and expanded release to <em>Monster Hunter Freedom 2</em> which was based on the second mainline <em>Monster Hunter</em> game that never released outside Japan. Watch the trailer for the iOS release below:</p>\n<p><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"343\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/0JoCStLsRq8\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:0; padding:0;\">\n<a HEREYES href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/toucharcade?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel</a>\n</div>\n\t\t</p>\n<p>The iOS version was <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/2016/06/30/monster-hunter-freedom-unite-is-getting-updated-very-soon/\">broken for a bit</a> but Capcom actually went and fixed all the issues. I\u2019ve been playing it quite a bit outside the house because the last few weeks have been a <em>Monster Hunter</em> blur for me with the amount of time I\u2019ve put into <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>. It has been fun revisiting older entries in a franchise I love. </p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve been seeing everyone talk about <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> but wanted to check out the franchise on a portable, this is your cheapest option.

It released pretty late in the life cycle of the console but had great reviews across the board. It even won some awards at the time. I was pretty glad to see it release on iOS a year later. The sad thing is, the game never got the sales it deserved. <em>Ghost Trick</em> on the App Store has had quite the <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/2015/10/05/here-we-go-again-capcom-pulls-ghost-trick-from-purchase-histories/\">rocky history</a> with OS updates. As with many Japanese ports, iOS updates sometimes break things and in a lot of cases, games remain broken for too long. Last year saw a <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/2017/12/11/simogo-is-the-latest-developer-to-pull-out-of-mobile/\">double whammy</a> in updates with iOS 11 dropping support for 32-bit apps with the <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/2017/08/08/best-games-that-will-die-with-ios-11-32-bit-guide/\">Appocalypse</a> and the iPhone X releasing introducing another aspect ratio to design for. Watch the <em>Ghost Trick</em> trailer below: </p>\n<p><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"560\" height=\"343\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/2OxMfwK7XKM\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:0; padding:0;\">\n<a HEREYES href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/toucharcade?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel</a>\n</div>\n\t\t</p>\n<p><em>Ghost Trick</em> got updated for <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/2016/11/25/ghost-trick-ios-10/\">iOS 10 support</a> a while back and today it receives an iOS 11 and iPhone X support update. I tried <em>Ghost Trick</em> on my iPhone 7 running iOS 11.2.5 and could play it without issues before updating. I saw no change post updating either as expected. The screenshots on the App Store are now iPhone X ones and you can tell the \"iPhone X\" support just adds more artwork in the non game portion of the screen on both sides. A lot of old ports saw black bars added on the left and right when iOS moved to 16:9 aspect ratios and <em>Ghost Trick</em> for iPhone X has extended the artwork on the sides (not the game visuals) a bit more to fill up the screen. </p>\n<p>I\u2019m still impressed that Capcom has updated this given it is obviously not super successful. On the other hand <em>Bioshock</em> is still nowhere to be seen. If you haven\u2019t played <em>Ghost Trick</em> yet, now is a great time to check it out. You can play the first two chapters for free as well.

You'll play cards and roll dice to increase conversation points, decrease the threat level, and release hostages. Hostage Negotiator uses a unique \"hand-building\" mechanism that puts cards you purchase directly in your hand for next turn rather than leaving you wondering when the cards will show up like in deck-building games.</p>\n<p>In Hostage Negotiator there are multiple paths to victory, but the hostage taker has other plans. Will you try to calm him and get him to surrender? Will you stall and bide your time before sending in the team for a major extraction? How many hostages will you save?

This afternoon they announced the <a href=\"https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/21513835/answer-the-call-of-the-2018-hearthstone-wild-open\">2018 <em>Hearthstone</em> Wild Open</a>, which will be a real-deal tournament entirely in the Wild format. If you missed the boat on what \"Wild\" is, a few years ago Blizzard introduced card rotation into <em>Hearthstone</em> so if you're playing a \"standard\" <em>Hearthstone</em> game you only need to have cards from the most recent sets. \"Wild\" includes <em>all</em> <em>Hearthstone</em> cards, and watching games in the Wild format can be <em>nuts</em>.</p>\n<p>Typically card games like <em>Hearthstone</em> are balanced around just making sure the meta is standard is good, leaving formats like Wild to just sort of exist in a state of broken combos and other hilarious decks. In the world of <em>Magic the Gathering</em> the equivalent format is \"Legacy\" which is stupendously broken to the point that some games can be decided based solely on who goes first. (There's more to it than that, but, just to give you an idea of how broken combos can get.) <em>Hearthstone's</em> Wild isn't <b>that</b> bad, but, needless to say, watching matches will be very entertaining.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/4ZWIFK1238511518142418736.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"760\" height=\"270\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-230638\" srcset=\"http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/4ZWIFK1238511518142418736.jpg 760w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/4ZWIFK1238511518142418736-300x107.jpg 300w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/4ZWIFK1238511518142418736-620x220.jpg 620w, http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/4ZWIFK1238511518142418736-624x222.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px\" /></p>\n<p>Players have until February 18th <a href=\"https://battlefy.com/2018-hearthstone-wild-open\">to sign up to compete</a> in your specific regional open qualifiers which will take place between February 22nd and 25th, then March 1st through 4th.
