It&rsquo;s hard to be cavalier about a time of life defined by loss of vigor, increasing frailty, rising disease risk and falling cognitive faculties. Then there&rsquo;s the unavoidable matter of the end of consciousness and the self&ndash;death, in other words&ndash;that&rsquo;s drawing closer and closer. It&rsquo;s the rare person who can confront the final decline with flippancy or ease. That, as it turns out, might be our first mistake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Humans are not alone in facing the ultimate reckoning, but we&rsquo;re the only species&ndash;as far as we know&ndash;who spends its whole life knowing death is coming. A clam dredged from the ocean off Iceland in 2006&ndash;and inadvertently killed by the scientists who discovered it&ndash;carried growth lines on its shell indicating it had been around since 1499. That was enough time for 185,055 generations of mayfly&ndash;which live as little as a day&ndash;to come and go. Neither clam nor fly gave a thought to that mortal math.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Humans fall somewhere between those two extremes. Globally, the average life span is 71.4 years; for a few lucky people, it may exceed 100 years. It has never, to science&rsquo;s knowledge, exceeded the 122 years, 164 days lived by Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who was born when Ulysses S. Grant was in the White House and died when Bill Clinton lived there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of us would like a little bit of that Calment magic, and we&rsquo;ve made at least some progress. Life expectancy in the U.S. exceeds the global average, clocking in at just under 79 years. In 1900, it was just over 47 years. The extra decades came courtesy of just the things you&rsquo;d expect: vaccines, antibiotics, sanitation and improved detection and treatment of a range of diseases. Advances in genetics and in our understanding of dementia are helping to extend our factory warranties still further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None of that, however, changes the way we contemplate the end of life&ndash;often with anxiety and asceticism, practicing a sort of existential bartering. We can narrow our experiences and give up indulgences in exchange for a more guardedly lived life that might run a little longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what if we could take off some of that bubble wrap? What about living longer and actually having some fun? A Yale University study just this month found that in a group of 4,765 people with an average age of 72, those who carried a gene variant linked to dementia&ndash;but also had positive attitudes about aging&ndash;were 50% less likely to develop the disorder than people who carried the gene but faced aging with more pessimism or fear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There may be something to be said then for aging less timidly&ndash;as a sort of happy contrarian, arguing when you feel like arguing, playing when you feel like playing. Maybe you want to pass up the quiet of the country for the churn of a city. Maybe you want to drink a little, eat a rich meal, have some sex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The most important advice we offer people about longevity is, &lsquo;Throw away your lists,&#39;&rdquo; says Howard Friedman, professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside, and co-author of The Longevity Project. &ldquo;We live in a self-help society full of lists: &lsquo;lose weight, hit the gym.&rsquo; So why aren&rsquo;t we all healthy? People who live a long time can work hard and play hard.&rdquo; Under the right circumstances, it increasingly seems, so could all of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marie Ashdown, 90, has lived in New York City for nearly 60 years, in an apartment on the east side of Manhattan. New York has beaten down younger people than her, but Ashdown, executive director of the Musicians Emergency Fund, loves city life. &ldquo;I have a fire in my belly,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not one minute of the day that I don&rsquo;t learn.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a classical-music connoisseur, Ashdown organizes two concerts a year at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. When she&rsquo;s not working, she takes weekend trips outside of the city, and spends her free time binding old books. Like many New Yorkers several decades her junior, she often orders takeout rather than bother with cooking. &ldquo;We have the best and worst here,&rdquo; says Ashdown. &ldquo;We learn to cope, live on the defensive and conquer fear.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She&rsquo;s hardly the only senior who loves city living. In the U.S., 80% of people ages 65 and older are now living in metropolitan areas, and according to the World Health Organization, by 2030, an estimated 60% of all people will live in cities&ndash;many of them over age 60. You may lose a little sidewalk speed and have to work harder to get up and down subway stairs, but cities increasingly rank high on both doctors&rsquo; and seniors&rsquo; lists of the best places to age gracefully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every year, the Milken Institute Center for the Future of Aging (CFA) ranks the best metropolitan places for successful aging, and most years, major cities sweep the top 10 spots. No wonder: cities tend to have strong health systems, opportunities for continued learning, widespread public transportation and an abundance of arts and culture. That&rsquo;s not to say that people can&rsquo;t feel isolated or lonely in cities, but you can get lonely in a country cottage too. In cities, the cure can be just outside your door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We all long to bump into each other,&rdquo; says Paul Irving, the chairman of the Milken Institute CFA. &ldquo;The ranges of places where this can happen in cities tend to create more options and opportunities.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s that aspect&ndash;the other-people aspect&ndash;that may be the particularly challenging for some, especially as we age and families disperse. But there are answers: a 2017 study in the journal Personal Relationships found that it can be friends, not family, who matter most. The study looked at 270,000 people in nearly 100 countries and found that while both family and friends are associated with happiness and better health, as people aged, the health link remained only for people with strong friendships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;[While] in a lot of ways, relationships with friends had a similar effect as those with family,&rdquo; says William Chopik, assistant professor of psychology at Michigan State University and the author of the study, &ldquo;in others, they surpassed them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the primacy of family has been oversold as a key to long life, so has the importance of avoiding conflict or emotional upset. Shouting back at cable news is no way to spend your golden years, but passion, it&rsquo;s turning out, may be more life-sustaining than apathy, engagement more than indifference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a study published by the American Aging Association, researchers analyzed data from the Georgia Centenarian Study, a survey of 285 people who were at least (or nearly) 100 years old, as well as 273 family members and other proxies who provided information about them. The investigators were looking at how the subjects scored on various personality traits, including conscientiousness, extraversion, hostility and neuroticism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a group, the centenarians tested lower on neuroticism and higher on competence and extraversion. Their proxies ranked them a bit higher on neuroticism, as well as on hostility. It&rsquo;s impossible to draw a straight line between those strong personality traits and long life, but the authors saw a potential one, citing other studies showing that centenarians rank high on &ldquo;moral righteousness,&rdquo; which leads to robust temperaments that &ldquo;may help centenarians adapt well to later life.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<drupal-entity data-embed-button=\"ti_media_oembed\" data-entity-id=\"719850\" data-entity-label=\"Ti Media Oembed\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" data-view-mode=\"oembed_display\"></drupal-entity>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time that crankiness, judiciously deployed, can be adaptive, its polar opposite&ndash;cheerfulness and optimism&ndash;may be less so. Worried people are likelier to be vigilant people, alert to a troubling physical symptom or a loss of some faculty that overly optimistic people might dismiss. Friedman and his collaborator Leslie R. Martin, a professor of psychology at La Sierra University in Riverside, Calif., base their book on work begun in 1921 by Stanford University psychologist Lewis Terman, who recruited 1,500 boys and girls born around 1910 and proposed to follow them throughout their lifetimes and, when he died&ndash;which happened in 1956&ndash;to have successors continue the work. Friedman and Martin have been two of those successors, and they&rsquo;ve learned a lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our research found that the more cheerful, outgoing children did not, for the most part, live any longer than their more introverted or serious classmates,&rdquo; says Friedman. &ldquo;Excessively happy people may ignore real threats and fail to take precautions or follow medical advice. It is O.K. to fret&ndash;if in a responsible manner.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One tip for long life that is not coming in for quite so much revisionist thinking is exercise&ndash;and some seniors are achieving remarkable things. Take Ginette Bedard, 84, of Howard Beach, N.Y.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a drizzly morning last Nov. 5, but that didn&rsquo;t stop Bedard from crossing the New York City Marathon finish line first in her age group. Bedard picked up running decades ago as a way to keep fit, but she didn&rsquo;t run her first marathon until she was 69 years old. &ldquo;I was watching the marathon runners on TV and I was so envious,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I was thinking, I cannot do that, they are all superhumans.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So she decided to become one of them. She began training daily until she could run the full 26.2 miles, and she&rsquo;s run nearly every New York City Marathon since. &ldquo;It takes discipline and brainpower and dedication,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;The running is hard, but the finish line is euphoria.&rdquo; She now runs three hours every day along the beach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Few physicians would recommend that all octogenarians pick up a three-hour-a-day running habit, but adding even a small amount of movement to daily life has been repeatedly shown to be beneficial, for a whole range of reasons. &ldquo;Exercise likely works through several mechanisms,&rdquo; says Dr. Thomas Gill, director of the Yale Program on Aging. &ldquo;Increasing physical activity will improve endurance; it benefits muscle strength and balance and [reduces] occurrence of serious fall injuries. It also provides a benefit to psychology, by lifting spirits.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exactly how much&ndash;or how little&ndash;exercise it takes to begin paying dividends has been one of the happy surprises of longevity research. A 2016 study found that elderly people who exercised for just 15 minutes a day, at an intensity level of a brisk walk, had a 22% lower risk of early death compared to people who did no exercise. A 2017 study found that exercising even just two days a week can lower risk for premature death. Researchers from McMaster University in Canada even found that breaking a sweat for just 60 seconds may be enough to improve health and fitness (as long as it&rsquo;s a tough workout).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Healthy eating is something else that may have a lot more wiggle room than we&rsquo;ve assumed, and if there&rsquo;s such a thing as a longevity diet, there may be more on the menu than seniors have been told. &ldquo;I have my wine and ice cream,&rdquo; says Bedard without apology. Similarly, 90-year-old Ashdown phones her takeout orders into Tal Bagels on First Avenue, not some trendy vegan joint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It really is an issue of moderation,&rdquo; says Peter Martin, a professor of human development and family studies at Iowa State University, who runs an ongoing study of centenarians. Martin notes that while most centenarians eat different but generally healthy diets, one consistent thing he has picked up from work with his 100-plus crowd is breakfast. &ldquo;They rarely skip breakfast,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s often at a very specific time, and the routine is important.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alcohol has its place too. An August 2017 study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that light to moderate alcohol use (14 or fewer drinks per week for men and seven or fewer for women) is associated with a lower risk of death compared to people who don&rsquo;t drink at all. If you&rsquo;re a nondrinker, that&rsquo;s no reason to start, and if you drink only infrequently, it&rsquo;s no reason to drink more. Still, among the more than 333,000 people in the study, light and moderate drinkers were 20% less likely to die from any cause during the study period compared with their completely abstemious peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s also an argument for letting go of diet obsessiveness, especially if you&rsquo;re at a reasonably healthy weight already. A 2016 study found that women over age 50 who were categorized as normal weight, but reported fluctuating (dropping more than 10 lb. and gaining it back at least three times) were 3&frac12; times more likely to experience sudden cardiac death than those whose weight stayed the same. The takeaway: simply stay in a healthy range; striving for a smaller size isn&rsquo;t necessarily doing you any longevity favors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, as long as seniors are enjoying themselves with some indulgent food and drink, they may as well round out the good-times trifecta with a little sex. It&rsquo;s no secret that remaining sexually active has been linked to life satisfaction and, in some cases, longer life. One celebrated study, published in the British Medical Journal in 1997, followed 918 men in a Welsh town for 10 years and found that those with a higher frequency of orgasm had a 50% reduced risk of mortality. Friedman and his colleagues, working with the Terman group, found something similar&ndash;though not quite as dramatic&ndash;for women. A 2016 study from Michigan State University was less sanguine, finding that older men who had sex once a week or more were almost twice as likely to suffer a cardiovascular event than men who had less sex; that was especially so if the more active men were satisfied with the sex, which often means they achieved orgasm. For older women, sex seemed to be protective against cardiovascular event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem for the men was likely overexertion, but there are ways around that. &ldquo;Older adults have to realize that it&rsquo;s intimacy that&rsquo;s important,&rdquo; says Dr. Gary Kennedy, director of geriatric psychiatry at Montefiore Medical Center in New York. &ldquo;If the focus is on pleasure rather than achieving orgasm each time, it can be fulfilling.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this and other dimensions of aging, Kennedy cites pianist Vladimir Horowitz, who died at age 86 and was still performing into his 80s. Conceding the limitations of age, he left the most demanding pieces out of his performances; of those that remained, he would play the slower ones first, making the faster ones seem faster still by comparison. &ldquo;He would optimize, not maximize,&rdquo; says Kennedy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is an admitted bumper-sticker quality to dictum like that, but compared with the familiar age-related wisdom&ndash;take it slow, watch your diet, stay cheerful&ndash;it&rsquo;s bracing. There are, Kennedy says, no truly healthy centenarians; you can&rsquo;t put 100 points on the board without getting worn out and banged up along the way. But there are independent centenarians and happy centenarians and centenarians who have had a rollicking good ride. The same is true for people who will never reach the 100-year mark but make the very most of the time they do get. The end of life is a nonnegotiable thing. The quality and exact length of that life, however, is something we very much have the power to shape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;With reporting by AMANDA MACMILLAN</p>\r\n]]>  </content:encoded>\n  <media:group>\n    <media:content url=\"http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/200x150/public/field/image/longevity-strategy-maciek-jasik-2.jpg?itok=301PX6oX\" type=\"image/jpeg\" isDefault=\"false\" expression=\"sample\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" />\n    <media:thumbnail url=\"http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/75x75/public/field/image/longevity-strategy-maciek-jasik-2.jpg?itok=mttIzcqh\" type=\"image/jpeg\" isDefault=\"false\" expression=\"sample\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\">\n    </media:thumbnail>\n    <media:keywords/>\n    <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><p>Maciek Jasik</p>\r\n</media:credit>\n  </media:group>\n</item>\n\n<item>\n  <title>\n    <![CDATA[Two-Month-Old Baby Allegedly Suffers 35 Broken Bones; Foster Father Charged\r\n]]>  </title>\n  <link>\n  <![CDATA[http://www.health.com/syndication/foster-father-allegedly-injured-baby-with-35-broken-bones]]>  </link>\n  <pubDate>\n    <![CDATA[Tue, 13 Feb 2018 12:18:52 -0500]]>  </pubDate>\n  <dc:creator>\n    <![CDATA[Health]]>  </dc:creator>\n  <section><![CDATA[ ]]></section> \n  <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">\n    <![CDATA[http://www.health.com/syndication/foster-father-allegedly-injured-baby-with-35-broken-bones]]>  </guid>\n  <description>\n    <![CDATA[A 26-year-old foster father is facing neglect and battery charges in Indianapolis.\r\n]]>  </description>\n  <content:encoded>\n    <![CDATA[<drupal-entity data-embed-button=\"ti_media_oembed\" data-entity-id=\"719001\" data-entity-label=\"Ti Media Oembed\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" data-view-mode=\"oembed_display\"></drupal-entity>\r\n\r\n<p>A 26-year-old foster father is facing neglect and battery charges in Indianapolis, where he is accused of squeezing the limbs of a 2-month-old girl.

After years of abuse, she now advocates for the safety of athletes.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love gymnastics with all my heart. It&rsquo;s a beautiful sport and has been part of my life as far back as I can remember. It&rsquo;s that very deep appreciation for the art of gymnastics and the athletes who perform it that drove me to do what was once considered a cardinal sin in my sport: Criticize it in public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To clarify, it wasn&rsquo;t the sport of gymnastics itself that I criticized&mdash;it was the system and the people running it. About a decade ago, with the U.S. national women&rsquo;s team at the top of its game, and with the linchpins of gymnastics, Bela and Marta Karolyi&mdash;owners of the Texas ranch where the Olympic team trained&mdash;basking in public adulation, I chose to speak out about what was wrong. I knew that what I had to say was going to be unpopular with many, including my former coaches and fans of our sport. But I also knew that there were hundreds of young girls dreaming of Olympic gold who deserved to train in safe environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-entity data-embed-button=\"ti_media_oembed\" data-entity-id=\"718755\" data-entity-label=\"Ti Media Oembed\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" data-view-mode=\"oembed_display\"></drupal-entity>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.instyle.com/syndication/olympic-gymnast-aly-raisman-reveals-sexual-abuse-by-team-doctor-larry-nassar\"><strong>RELATED: Olympic Gymnast Aly Raisman Reveals Sexual Abuse By Team Doctor</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coming up through the system and being personally coached and trained by the Karolyis, I knew first-hand what a scary and unhealthy place the famed Karolyi Ranch could be. I knew what it was like to be grabbed by the scruff of my neck and dragged across the room by Marta. I knew what it was like to be so scared to ask to use the bathroom that I peed in my leotard in practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was in this unhealthy environment that at the age of 14, while training for the 1996 Olympics, I was told to continue practicing through severe, nagging leg pain. As punishment for complaining, I was made to do my routine an increased number of repetitions, performing it over and over until I literally collapsed on the mat. Only then was I was given a closer look, leading to the discovery that I had been training on a fractured leg.</p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-entity data-embed-button=\"ti_media_oembed\" data-entity-id=\"718758\" data-entity-label=\"Ti Media Oembed\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" data-view-mode=\"oembed_display\"></drupal-entity>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.instyle.com/celebrity/aly-raisman-body-shaming-airport-experience\"><strong>RELATED: Aly Raisman Had the Perfect Response to a Body-Shaming Airport Experience</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With child athletes living at the ranch for weeks at a time without the supervision of their parents or any adults other than USA Gymnastics (USAG) employees, an atmosphere was created where verbal and emotional abuse became commonplace. I believe this, coupled with fear of retribution for saying anything negative about the Karolyis or their ilk, made abuse possible. It later came out that the ranch was the site where numerous young gymnasts were <a href=\"http://www.instyle.com/news/aly-raismain-larry-nassar-court-testimony\">molested by team doctor Larry Nassar</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2006, after a career that included being part of the first U.S. Women&rsquo;s Gymnastics team to bring home gold and being the youngest gymnast to win a U.S. National Championship, I left the competitive gymnastics world. I was moving on, building a family life, working as a coach to young gymnasts. But I couldn&rsquo;t stomach the thought of these girls having to go through what I had experienced. With the support of my husband Mike and very few others, I made it a mission to warn people that the gymnastics system under USAG and the Karolyis was not safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-entity data-embed-button=\"ti_media_oembed\" data-entity-id=\"718761\" data-entity-label=\"Ti Media Oembed\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" data-view-mode=\"oembed_display\"></drupal-entity>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.instyle.com/syndication/mckayla-maroney-metoo-molested\"><strong>RELATED: Olympic Gymnast McKayla Maroney Alleges Sexual Abuse by U.S. Team Doctor</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I spoke out&mdash;first to HBO. For the first time, in an interview in 2008, I didn&rsquo;t sugar coat anything. I shared my experiences and was honest. It was liberating and challenging at the same time. I was speaking my truth, which was tremendously rewarding, but I was also shunned, blacklisted, and criticized by the community I had been a part of for so long. Hate mail came&mdash;from former fans who didn&rsquo;t want to hear what I had to say and from high-ranking coaches in the system who accused me of stabbing gymnastics in the back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To USAG, I became a non-person. I stopped receiving financial opportunities and referrals, I was no longer invited to speak at and attend many events, and very few athletes came to my defense or chose to corroborate what I had to say, even though they had seen what I had seen. It hurt, but I had made a decision and I stuck to my guns. I did more interviews. Then, in 2012, I released my memoir, <em><a data-ecommerce=\"true\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Off-Balance-Memoir-Dominique-Moceanu/dp/152263522X?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=152263522X&amp;tag=instycom00-20&amp;ascsubtag=9d7d3c461415f49c78ae0d139004f902\" target=\"_blank\">Off Balance</a>,</em> where I went into greater detail about my experiences. The haters continued to hate, but I couldn&rsquo;t, I wouldn&rsquo;t, let them stop me. The safety of young gymnasts was too important. The neglectful and inhumane treatment they often received had gone on too long, and I promised I would never stop sharing my story with anyone who would listen.</p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-entity data-embed-button=\"ti_media_oembed\" data-entity-id=\"718764\" data-entity-label=\"Ti Media Oembed\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" data-view-mode=\"oembed_display\"></drupal-entity>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.instyle.com/news/meghan-markle-personal-essay-being-enough\">RELATED: Meghan Markle&rsquo;s Personal Essay on Being &quot;Enough&quot; Is What You Need Today</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was fortunate in that I have never been sexually assaulted by Dr. Nassar, but when the first brave women came forward to tell me about having been horrifically abused by him, it was heartbreaking and gut-wrenching&mdash;though not surprising. The total lack of regard for athlete safety and wellbeing, the culture of fear, and the never-question-the-Karolyis-or-their-staff mentality created a perfect storm in which a monster like Nassar could thrive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, he was one of the very few adults who was actually &ldquo;nice&rdquo; to us. (We&#39;ve since learned that this is typical grooming behavior, to provide a false sense of security when so many other adults were being either neglectful or abusive: Be a friendly, sympathetic voice to build trust but not offer any actual help or assistance.) That Nassar could engage in his disgusting behavior unchecked for years, sexually assaulting hundreds of young girls, may sound impossible to most, but not to me. You don&rsquo;t speak out, you never complain, and nobody is looking out for you. How tragically easy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Testifying about this warped culture before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year was one of the proudest moments of my life. I felt that after shouting in a vacuum for so long, I was finally being heard and actual change was being made. And with the passing of <a href=\"http://www.instyle.com/celebrity/dianne-feinstein-athlete-sexual-assault-bill\">resulting legislation this year</a>, we can now confidently say that future generations of children participating in sports will be safer. It&rsquo;s a vindication, but there is still much work to be done. While new standards and legislation are set, it is more imperative than ever that we work to protect athletes and provide safe environments for them. Weeding out the abusers, bad actors, and their enablers is a major part of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It hasn&rsquo;t been easy. But I learned long ago that being a champion of anything isn&rsquo;t easy. I&rsquo;m honored to have had a voice, to have been able to help bring about positive change, and I know that better days are ahead. I am hopeful that we can now begin to develop safer practices for all youth sports, including the beautiful sport of gymnastics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>The Dominique Moceanu Gymnastics Center with open its doors in Medina, Ohio, this May.</i><i> </i></p>\r\n]]>  </content:encoded>\n  <media:group>\n    <media:content url=\"http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/200x150/public/field/image/020818-dominique-monceanu-bela-karoly-lead.jpg?itok=ci6jRqjL\" type=\"image/jpeg\" isDefault=\"false\" expression=\"sample\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" />\n    <media:thumbnail url=\"http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/75x75/public/field/image/020818-dominique-monceanu-bela-karoly-lead.jpg?itok=e8ONIsQ_\" type=\"image/jpeg\" isDefault=\"false\" expression=\"sample\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\">\n    </media:thumbnail>\n    <media:keywords/>\n    <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><p>Dave Black</p>\r\n</media:credit>\n  </media:group>\n</item>\n\n<item>\n  <title>\n    <![CDATA[Gigi Hadid Slams Weight Commenters: 'I Will Not Further Explain the Way My Body Looks'\r\n]]>  </title>\n  <link>\n  <![CDATA[http://www.health.com/syndication/gigi-hadid-slams-weight-commenters-fashion-week-twitter]]>  </link>\n  <pubDate>\n    <![CDATA[Mon, 12 Feb 2018 10:19:58 -0500]]>  </pubDate>\n  <dc:creator>\n    <![CDATA[Health]]>  </dc:creator>\n  <section><![CDATA[ ]]></section> \n  <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">\n    <![CDATA[http://www.health.com/syndication/gigi-hadid-slams-weight-commenters-fashion-week-twitter]]>  </guid>\n  <description>\n    <![CDATA[The model took to social media on&nbsp;to shut down Twitter trolls&nbsp;criticizing&nbsp;her weight.\r\n]]>  </description>\n  <content:encoded>\n    <![CDATA[<p>[brightcove:5706903173001 default]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://people.com/tag/gigi-hadid/\">Gigi Hadid</a>: 1, cyberbullies: 0.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With New York Fashion Week in full swing, the 22-year-old model <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GiGiHadid?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" target=\"_blank\">took to social media</a> on Sunday to shut down Twitter trolls who are criticizing her for her weight on the catwalk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;For those of you so determined to come up w why my body has changed over the years, you may not know that when I started @ 17 I was not yet diagnosed<a href=\"http://people.com/bodies/what-is-hashimotos-disease-gigi-hadid-thyroid/\"> w/Hashimoto&rsquo;s disease</a>; those of u who called me &lsquo;too big for the industry&rsquo; were seeing inflammation &amp; water retention due to that,&rdquo; Hadid began.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She continued, &ldquo;Over the last few years I&rsquo;ve been properly medicated to help symptoms including those, as well as extreme fatigue, metabolism issues, body&rsquo;s ability to retain heat, etc &hellip; I was also part of a holistic medical trial that helped my thyroid levels balance out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-entity data-embed-button=\"ti_media_oembed\" data-entity-id=\"718584\" data-entity-label=\"Ti Media Oembed\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" data-view-mode=\"oembed_display\"></drupal-entity>\r\n\r\n<drupal-entity data-embed-button=\"ti_media_oembed\" data-entity-id=\"718587\" data-entity-label=\"Ti Media Oembed\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" data-view-mode=\"oembed_display\"></drupal-entity>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Although stress &amp; excessive travel can also affect the body, I have always eaten the same, my body just handles it differently now that my health is better.

In a statement the airline said, &ldquo;we can say confidently that at no point did any of our agents suggest this Guest (or any other for that matter) should flush or otherwise injure an animal. It is incredibly disheartening to hear this Guest reportedly decided to end her own pet&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aldecosea&rsquo;s lawyer, Adam Goodman, tells TIME that Aldecosea called Spirit Airlines to confirm she could bring her dwarf hamster Pebbles with her on her flight. After arriving at Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport on Nov. 21, everything seemed to be going as planned until a Spirit Airlines employee approached her saying the animal was not allowed, Goodman says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The employee allegedly suggested Aldecosea, who was studying at Wilson College 100 miles away, set the hamster free outside or flush it down the toilet, according to the Florida-based attorney.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aldecosea eventually flushed Pebbles down the toilet after she was unable to find someone to take the hamster or rent a car to drive instead of flying, the attorney says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spirit admits an employee initially incorrectly told her the hamster would be allowed to fly with her. However, the airline says it arranged for Aldecosea to board a flight nine hours later so that she could find accommodation for Pebbles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spirit&rsquo;s support animal guidelines say that the airline does not accept rodents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goodman tells TIME that he and Aldecosea are planning to sit down and &ldquo;discuss the legal remedies available,&rdquo; including a possible lawsuit. Aldecosea reportedly got the support hamster after she developed benign, but painful golf-ball size growth in her neck, <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article198971069.html\" target=\"_blank\">according to the Miami </a><em><a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article198971069.html\" target=\"_blank\">Herald</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The news follows airlines like <a href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/delta-air-lines/\" target=\"_blank\">Delta</a> and United <a href=\"http://time.com/5110495/delta-airlines-support-animals/\">cracking down on support animal</a> and a customer who was denied entry onto a flight because of their <a href=\"http://www.thedrive.com/news/18135/united-airlines-refuses-to-let-woman-fly-with-emotional-support-animal-peacock\" target=\"_blank\">support peacock</a>.

In fact, research suggests dropping the f-bomb comes with some legit mind-body benefits. Here, Byrne highlights four surprising ways curse words can boost your well-being.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Unleashing expletives might actually raise your pain threshold</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For a 2009&nbsp;<a href=\"http://journals.lww.com/neuroreport/Abstract/2009/08050/Swearing_as_a_response_to_pain.4.aspx\">study</a>&nbsp;done at Keele University in the UK, researchers&nbsp;asked college students to plunge&nbsp;a hand in ice-cold water. They found that when the participants repeated a swear word out loud during the chilly experience, they were able to keep their digits submerged for longer, and reported feeling less pain than when they repeated a neutral word. &quot;Their subjective experience of how bad [their hand] hurt&nbsp;was&nbsp;incredibly different when they were&nbsp;swearing,&quot; says Byrne. &quot;When they were swearing, it didn&rsquo;t feel as bad.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One theory is that cursing helps <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/smarter-living/the-case-for-cursing.html\">trigger&nbsp;your &quot;fight or flight&quot; response</a>, which raises your heart rate and pumps more adrenaline through your body&mdash;two physiological responses that make us more tolerant of pain. So the next time you stub your toe, go ahead and&nbsp;curse out your couch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>RELATED: </b><a href=\"http://www.health.com/stress/3-stress-busting-yoga-poses\"><b>3 Stress-Busting Yoga Moves</b></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Well-timed curses can&nbsp;help relieve&nbsp;stress</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Struggling to get through a tough task? Go ahead and say how you<em> really</em> feel about it. &ldquo;Studies show that when you put people in stressful situations and tell them they cannot swear, their performance goes down and their experience of stress is much greater,&rdquo; explains Byrne. She points to research done in airplane cockpits&nbsp;and operating rooms:&nbsp;Pilots and surgeons who are allowed to swear on the job are better able to <a href=\"http://www.health.com/syndication/most-stressful-life-events\">recover</a> from stressful events (think: tricky takeoffs, or close calls in surgery) compared to pilots and surgeons who aren&#39;t permitted to curse.&nbsp;The takeaway: a string of expletives can be&nbsp;a useful way to blow off some f*cking steam and get the job done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>RELATED: </b><a href=\"http://www.health.com/stress/6-times-celebrities-got-angry-in-public-and-how-they-handled-it\"><b>6 Times Celebs Got Angry in Public (and How They Handled It)</b></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>To get our top wellness tips in your inbox, <a href=\"https://pages.email.health.com/newsletters/\">sign up for the HEALTH newsletter</a>!</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Using swear words can help you&nbsp;cope with health issues</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;For people recovering from cancer, or who have a long-term chronic illness, swearing is really helpful in terms of processing their emotions,&rdquo; Byrne says. &quot;With respect to cancer patients, the work particularly on male patients&mdash;specifically testicular cancer survivors&mdash;shows that [swearing] is&nbsp;a way to talk about sadness and loss without losing face as &quot;masculine,&quot; by crying or admitting to fear, for example.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Swearing while you sweat may&nbsp;make you physically stronger</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You know those grips you can squeeze to build finger, hand, and forearm strength? Well, they work much better if you curse while you squeeze, according to researchers. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen that you can exercise much more force on those objects and also do it for longer if you&rsquo;re swearing while you hold them,&rdquo; explains Byrne. &ldquo;It increases your <a href=\"http://www.health.com/mind-body/resilient-person\">resilience</a> and strength temporarily.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Give it a try! As you bang out reps at the gym, repeat a few choice words and see what that does for you. And if you ever find yourself in a situation in which you need to summon extreme strength&mdash;say, to lift a heavy object off someone trapped beneath&nbsp;it&mdash;swear with all your might, says Byrne.</p>\r\n]]>  </content:encoded>\n  <media:group>\n    <media:content url=\"http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/200x150/public/styles/main/public/woman-swearing-gettyimages-607954294.jpg?itok=lhd9pioy\" type=\"image/jpeg\" isDefault=\"false\" expression=\"sample\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" />\n    <media:thumbnail url=\"http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/75x75/public/styles/main/public/woman-swearing-gettyimages-607954294.jpg?itok=2P_8vF3p\" type=\"image/jpeg\" isDefault=\"false\" expression=\"sample\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\">\n    </media:thumbnail>\n    <media:keywords/>\n    <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><p>Francesco Carta fotografo/Getty Images</p>\r\n</media:credit>\n  </media:group>\n</item>\n\n<item>\n  <title>\n    <![CDATA[7 Best White Noise Machines for a Good Night's Sleep\r\n]]>  </title>\n  <link>\n  <![CDATA[http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20961823,00.html]]>  </link>\n  <pubDate>\n    <![CDATA[Mon, 08 Feb 2016 09:05:00 -0500]]>  </pubDate>\n  <dc:creator>\n    <![CDATA[Health]]>  </dc:creator>\n  <section><![CDATA[ ]]></section> \n  <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">\n    <![CDATA[http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20961823,00.html]]>  </guid>\n  <description>\n    <![CDATA[These soothing, noise-masking gadgets are designed to help you drift off to the land of nod, and stay there all night long.\r\n]]>  </description>\n  <content:encoded>\n    <![CDATA[]]>  </content:encoded>\n  <media:group>\n    <media:content url=\"http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/migration/img/web/2015/10/white-noise-opener-200x150.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" isDefault=\"false\" expression=\"sample\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" />\n    <media:thumbnail url=\"http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/migration/img/web/2015/10/white-noise-opener-75x75.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" isDefault=\"false\" expression=\"sample\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\">\n    </media:thumbnail>\n    <media:keywords/>\n    <media:credit role=\"photographer\"></media:credit>\n  </media:group>\n</item>\n\n<item>\n  <title>\n    <![CDATA[11 Letter Board Quotes That Will Inspire You\r\n]]>  </title>\n  <link>\n  <![CDATA[http://www.health.com/mind-body/inspiring-letter-board-quotes]]>  </link>\n  <pubDate>\n    <![CDATA[Fri, 02 Feb 2018 18:03:37 -0500]]>  </pubDate>\n  <dc:creator>\n    <![CDATA[Health]]>  </dc:creator>\n  <section><![CDATA[ ]]></section> \n  <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">\n    <![CDATA[http://www.health.com/mind-body/inspiring-letter-board-quotes]]>  </guid>\n  <description>\n    <![CDATA[Totally perfect for Pinterest.\r\n]]>  </description>\n  <content:encoded>\n    <![CDATA[<p>[brightcove:2202873082001 default]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Introducing our latest obsession: <a href=\"http://www.health.com/mind-body/february-new-years-resolutions\">letter boards</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From motivational mantras to relatable phrases, these letter board quotes add a classic, subtle piece of inspiration to our day.

That&#39;s the premise behind self-care&mdash;a buzzy term you&#39;ve probably heard a lot about or even tried to practice. The trick to making self-care pay off&nbsp;is to incorporate it into a regular part of your life. With 2018 upon us, make this the year you do just that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Self-care is something we tend to forget about because it can almost seem as if you&rsquo;re being selfish,&quot;&nbsp;says Apryl Zarate Schlueter, author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Finding-Success-Balance-Journey-Cheerful/dp/0998320307\"><i>Finding Success in Balance: My Journey to the Cheerful Mind</i></a>.&nbsp;&quot;But we need to give to ourselves. Otherwise, you can run low on energy and put negativity out there instead of positivity.&rdquo; These are the expert-backed self-care&nbsp;suggestions&nbsp;to take on this year&mdash;and find more happiness over the next 12 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"http://www.health.com/food/12-superfoods-for-stress-relief\">10 Superfoods for Stress Relief</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Take vacations</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You always tell yourself you&#39;re going to do it&mdash;pack a bag, book a flight, and head somewhere exotic or so&nbsp;far off the beaten path, you can breathe and just be. In 2018, start planning. &ldquo;People forget to take advantage of having a vacation from work,&quot; says Schlueter. &quot;It allows you to slow down so you can speed back up when you get back.&quot; No paid time off at your company? Steal away for a long holiday weekend, then and milk every minute of your time away so you&nbsp;come back refreshed and restored.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Try workouts outside of your comfort zone</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&#39;t have to tell you about all the benefits of regular sweat sessions. And while you might have found a specific routine that works for you, stretching your boundaries with something new&nbsp;can fill you with pulse-pounding adrenaline, challenge your skill set, and give you another reason to make it to the gym every day.&nbsp;For&nbsp;Schlueter,&nbsp;checking out a flying trapezes class was her fitness self-care. &ldquo;That was my zen place where I could socialize, work out, and have fun,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"http://www.health.com/sex/celebrities-talking-about-masturbation\">6 Times Celebrities Got Real About Masturbation</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Masturbate more</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Sexual activity and orgasms have lots of legit&nbsp;health benefits, from easing stress to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0333102413476374\">relieving headaches</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28986148\">boosting brain activity</a>. Considering that just 20% of women reported masturbating in the past month, according to research in <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743609515332070?_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_origin=gateway&amp;_docanchor=&amp;md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb\"><i>The Journal of Sexual Medicine</i></a>, you may find that you have some catching up to do in the self-love department. No disrespect to sex with a partner, but sometimes going solo is the simplest way to snag those body benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Start saying&nbsp;&#39;no&#39;</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This one&nbsp;little word has&nbsp;a whole lot of power over your mood and happiness. &ldquo;Saying no to someone or something is a great form of self-care. Not only is it allowing you to avoid something&nbsp;you don&rsquo;t want to do, but it gives space in your life to say yes to something you do,&rdquo; says Schlueter. While it may be difficult at first, you&rsquo;ll notice it gets easier to speak up and voice your needs as time goes on.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Splurge on more events or&nbsp;experiences</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Sure you&rsquo;ve heard that money can&rsquo;t make you happy. But actually, there is a way that it can, according to research:&nbsp;Spend your dough on experiences rather than stuff. That&rsquo;s why a great self-care move is to plunk down cash on something that feels indulgent yet&nbsp;you&rsquo;ve always wanted to do or see. Maybe it&rsquo;s finally catching&nbsp;<i>Hamilton</i>, booking a luxurious spa day, or signing up for a yoga retreat. It&rsquo;s completely up to you as long as you know it will bring you joy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20478472,00.html\">Big Perks: Coffee&#39;s Health Benefits</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Wake up with gratitude</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Maintaining a happy, lighthearted perspective on the day can be tough, especially when there&rsquo;s a million things going on. But a positive outlook is a gift you can give yourself by pledging to start or end each day&nbsp;reminding yourself about all that&#39;s good in your life. &ldquo;Thinking about one thing you&rsquo;re grateful for reinforces a positive mindset, which prevents you from defaulting to the negative,&rdquo; says Schlueter.

But Olivera died only this week, as the world&#39;s oldest man, at an impressive 113 years of age. And he claimed that the secret of his longevity was a diet &quot;based on vegetables&quot; and a daily glass of red wine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"http://www.cookinglight.com/healthy-living/healthy-habits/more-vegetables-dining-out\" target=\"_blank\">9 Ways to Get More Veggies When Dining </a><a href=\"http://www.cookinglight.com/healthy-living/healthy-habits/more-vegetables-dining-out\" target=\"_blank\">Out</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Olivera&#39;s family and community have come forward to share the story of his full and happy life, and just how he managed to achieve such an old age. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5329251/Worlds-oldest-man-dies-age-113.html\" target=\"_blank\">According to the <em>Daily Mail</em></a>, Olivera was born and raised in southwest Spain, and having lived there all his life, his extended family chalked up his long life to the land, where he grew his own vegetables. Something must be in the water, because Olivera was one of 32 people over the age of 90 among the 2,200 people who call the small village home.</p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-entity data-embed-button=\"ti_media_oembed\" data-entity-id=\"716274\" data-entity-label=\"Ti Media Oembed\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" data-view-mode=\"oembed_display\"></drupal-entity>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Daily</em> <em>Mail</em> explains that Spain has one of the highest life expectancies in the world, which many experts and health professionals credit to the fact that Spaniards stick to the <a href=\"http://www.cookinglight.com/eating-smart/nutrition-101/what-is-the-Mediterranean-diet\" target=\"_blank\">Mediterranean diet.</a> The Mediterranean diet is characterized by <a href=\"http://www.cookinglight.com/cooking-101/mediterranean-diet-essentials\" target=\"_blank\">many plant-based dishes</a>, unprocessed whole grains, and healthy fats, as well as the occasional glass of red wine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"http://www.cookinglight.com/eating-smart/nutrition-101/mediterranean-diet-guide\" target=\"_blank\">This Is How to Do the Mediterranean Diet </a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1200303\" target=\"_blank\">2013 study by the University of Barcelona</a> linked the Mediterranean diet to a healthy heart after studying 7,000 Spanish participants who switched to the diet for 5 years. The researchers behind the study discovered that there was a 30 percent decrease of cardiovascular disease among these high-risk participants following the change of diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While red wine is an important aspect of the Mediterranean diet, Cynthia Sass, MPH, RD, says that<a href=\"http://www.cookinglight.com/healthy-living/weight-loss/healthy-wine-serving-size\" target=\"_blank\"> the key to reaping health benefits is moderation</a>&mdash;women should enjoy a single 5-ounce glass, and for men, it&#39;s two glasses of the same amount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Olivera&#39;s daughter Antonia says that her father enjoyed great health throughout his entire life: despite having reached 113 years of age, Olivera only went to the hospital twice. He rarely experienced pains, aches, or serious illnesses, and up until the age of 107, he enjoyed a daily walk into the fields where he often harvested his own vegetables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While there&#39;s not a single solution to enjoying <a href=\"http://www.cookinglight.com/healthy-living/fitness/more-energy-50-years-old\" target=\"_blank\">health at an older age</a>, Olivera&#39;s own life just might be a clue of how to get there. In 2015, he told Spain&#39;s El Mundo that he wanted to live longer even though his friends had passed, adding: &quot;I know I&#39;m old, but I don&#39;t feel old.&quot;</p>\r\n]]>  </content:encoded>\n  <media:group>\n    <media:content url=\"http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/200x150/public/field/image/1801w-old-man.jpg?itok=Z7hDK_00\" type=\"image/jpeg\" isDefault=\"false\" expression=\"sample\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" />\n    <media:thumbnail url=\"http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/75x75/public/field/image/1801w-old-man.jpg?itok=4nfRZ6gC\" type=\"image/jpeg\" isDefault=\"false\" expression=\"sample\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\">\n    </media:thumbnail>\n    <media:keywords/>\n    <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><p>Getty: Thomas Koehler / Contributor</p>\r\n</media:credit>\n  </media:group>\n</item>\n\n<item>\n  <title>\n    <![CDATA[This Letterboard Is Going Viral for Its Refreshingly Honest Take on New Year&rsquo;s Resolutions\r\n]]>  </title>\n  <link>\n  <![CDATA[http://www.health.com/mind-body/february-new-years-resolutions]]>  </link>\n  <pubDate>\n    <![CDATA[Wed, 31 Jan 2018 13:28:38 -0500]]>  </pubDate>\n  <dc:creator>\n    <![CDATA[Health]]>  </dc:creator>\n  <section><![CDATA[ ]]></section> \n  <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">\n    <![CDATA[http://www.health.com/mind-body/february-new-years-resolutions]]>  </guid>\n  <description>\n    <![CDATA[Is it February yet?!\r\n]]>  </description>\n  <content:encoded>\n    <![CDATA[<drupal-entity data-embed-button=\"ti_media_oembed\" data-entity-id=\"716157\" data-entity-label=\"Ti Media Oembed\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" data-view-mode=\"oembed_display\"></drupal-entity>\r\n\r\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a new year for you to turn over a new leaf.

Nassar&nbsp;<a href=\"http://people.com/sports/larry-nassar-pleads-guilty-sexual-abuse-gymnasts/\">pleaded guilty in November to several counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct</a>. On Wednesday, Judge Rosemarie Aquilina of Michigan&rsquo;s Ingham County Circuit Court sentenced the 54-year-old to up to 175 years in prison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stephens said in court that, as a young child, her interests were <em>Clifford the Big Red Dog</em> and the Junie B. Jones book series. She still had not lost all of her baby teeth when she was forced into her first sexual act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Years later, when she was 12, Stephens told her parents about the abuse and her mother and father confronted their friend Nassar. Stephens said Nassar denied the abuse and &ldquo;my parents chose to believe Larry Nassar over me.&rdquo; She said her parents made her speak with Nassar about the allegations, and the predator allegedly told her, &ldquo;No one should ever do that, and if they do, you should tell someone.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After that, Stephens said in court that her relationship with her parents deteriorated, especially her connection to her father.</p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-entity data-embed-button=\"ti_media_oembed\" data-entity-id=\"715308\" data-entity-label=\"Ti Media Oembed\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" data-view-mode=\"oembed_display\"></drupal-entity>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;His belief that I lied seeped into the foundation of our relationship,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Every time we got into a fight, he would tell me, &lsquo;You need to apologize to Larry&rsquo; &hellip; I started to question whether the abuse ever happened. &rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As time passed, the Nassars began pressuring Stephens into babysitting their children, she said. When she was at their home, the family acted as if she never accused Nassar at all. Disconnected from her family, Stephens said she began doing all she could to pay for her own counseling, as she knew she could not ask her parents for help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She ended up confronting her father about Nassar again when she was 18, before leaving for college. Her father, who later killed himself, finally believed her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;My father and I did our best to patch up our tattered relationship before he committed suicide in 2016,&rdquo; Stephens told the court through tears. &ldquo;Admittedly, my father was experiencing debilitating health issues, but had he not had to bear the shame and self-loathing that stemmed from his defense of Larry Nassar, I believe he would have had a fighting chance for life.&rdquo;</p>\r\n]]>  </content:encoded>\n  <media:group>\n    <media:content url=\"http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/200x150/public/styles/main/public/kyle-stephens-larry-nassar-abuse-gettyimages-905651698.jpg?itok=4odnU_k-\" type=\"image/jpeg\" isDefault=\"false\" expression=\"sample\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" />\n    <media:thumbnail url=\"http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/75x75/public/styles/main/public/kyle-stephens-larry-nassar-abuse-gettyimages-905651698.jpg?itok=M5xEptee\" type=\"image/jpeg\" isDefault=\"false\" expression=\"sample\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\">\n    </media:thumbnail>\n    <media:keywords/>\n    <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><p>GEOFF ROBINS/Getty Images</p>\r\n</media:credit>\n  </media:group>\n</item>\n\n<item>\n  <title>\n    <![CDATA[8-Year-Old Dies From Rare Flesh-Eating Bacteria: Doctors 'Kept Cutting and Hoping', Mother Says\r\n]]>  </title>\n  <link>\n  <![CDATA[http://www.health.com/syndication/flesh-eating-bacteria-kills-boy]]>  </link>\n  <pubDate>\n    <![CDATA[Fri, 26 Jan 2018 10:41:50 -0500]]>  </pubDate>\n  <dc:creator>\n    <![CDATA[Health]]>  </dc:creator>\n  <section><![CDATA[ ]]></section> \n  <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">\n    <![CDATA[http://www.health.com/syndication/flesh-eating-bacteria-kills-boy]]>  </guid>\n  <description>\n    <![CDATA[A wound the boy suffered after falling off his bike became effected.&nbsp;\r\n]]>  </description>\n  <content:encoded>\n    <![CDATA[<drupal-entity data-embed-button=\"ti_media_oembed\" data-entity-id=\"715233\" data-entity-label=\"Ti Media Oembed\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" data-view-mode=\"oembed_display\"></drupal-entity>\r\n\r\n<p>When Sara Hebard&rsquo;s 8-year-old son suffered a minor injury after falling off his bicycle, she never expected her boy would be fighting for his life just days later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as he&rsquo;s done so many weekends before, Liam Flanagan spent January 13 playing on his bicycle in the driveway of his family&rsquo;s home in&nbsp;Pilot Rock, Oregon. But as he was careening down the hill that Saturday, Liam crashed into the dirt, and his bike&rsquo;s handlebar&nbsp;cut through his jeans, causing a deep laceration on his&nbsp;thigh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was quickly taken by family to a nearby emergency room, where doctors gave the second-grader seven stitches to close his wound and sent him on his way. Though the cut was painful, doctors felt it was minor enough not to give Liam antibiotics,&nbsp;Hebard says, and they fully expected for him to recover.&nbsp;Still, Hebard said her son kept complaining about a continuous ache around the area of his gash in the days that followed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;He said it hurt, but it was his very first&nbsp;accident&nbsp;and he never had&nbsp;stitches&nbsp;before,&rdquo; Hebard, 37, tells PEOPLE of Liam, who she says always had a smile that made others smile. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he was complaining any more than other kid would when they had their first stitches.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-entity data-embed-button=\"ti_media_oembed\" data-entity-id=\"715236\" data-entity-label=\"Ti Media Oembed\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" data-view-mode=\"oembed_display\"></drupal-entity>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://people.com/human-interest/california-dad-two-dies-flesh-eating-bacteria/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">California Dad of 2 Dies From Flesh-Eating Bacteria After Fishing with His Son</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hebard and Liam&rsquo;s step-father,&nbsp;Scott Hinkle, gave Liam Tylenol to soothe his discomfort over the next three days, but the pain grew increasingly unbearable for the young boy. That&rsquo;s when the couple examined Liam&rsquo;s thigh and groin-area and saw they had become gravely discolored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;My husband instantly freaked,&rdquo; Hebard recalls. &ldquo;He immediately said Liam had gangrene and he needed to go to the emergency room &mdash; and straight to the emergency room we went.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The couple rushed Liam to the hospital where he underwent emergency surgery to remove the infected tissue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next morning, Liam was airlifted from the small town hospital to&nbsp;Doernbecher Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Portland, where doctors performed multiple surgeries, amputating more and more of the boy&rsquo;s body to stay ahead of the infection that was making its way through his tissue.</p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-entity data-embed-button=\"ti_media_oembed\" data-entity-id=\"715239\" data-entity-label=\"Ti Media Oembed\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" data-view-mode=\"oembed_display\"></drupal-entity>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Each time they did a surgery, they kept telling us that they thought they got it,&rdquo; Hebard says. &ldquo;He was on three of the highest doses of antibiotics that you could get. They were pouring everything at them that they could, but they just kept cutting and hoping. Cutting and hoping.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctors discovered Liam had contracted a rare flesh-eating bacteria known as <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/features/necrotizingfasciitis/index.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">necrotizing fasciitis</a>, which they believe entered Liam&rsquo;s body through his wound from the soil he landed on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Necrotizing fasciitis quickly kills the body&rsquo;s soft tissue found around&nbsp;muscles, nerves, fat, and blood vessels and it can turn lethal in a short period of time, according to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/features/necrotizingfasciitis/index.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Centers For Disease Control</a>.&nbsp;Since 2010, about&nbsp;600 to 1,200 Americans are diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis each year, though the CDC notes this may be an underestimate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The infection can be successfully treated with antibiotics&nbsp;and surgery to remove infected tissue if it&rsquo;s caught early, which is important to a patient&rsquo;s survival. According to an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19385468\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NCBI</a>&nbsp;study, the infection has about a 27 percent mortality rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-entity data-embed-button=\"ti_media_oembed\" data-entity-id=\"715242\" data-entity-label=\"Ti Media Oembed\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" data-view-mode=\"oembed_display\"></drupal-entity>\r\n\r\n<p>Liam&rsquo;s doctors worked hard to control the infected area that stretched from ankle to armpit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The pain was so bad that he was screaming,&rdquo; Hebard says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s horrific. It is a horrific&nbsp;torture,&nbsp;that&rsquo;s&nbsp;what it is. The last&nbsp;things I got to hear from my son was him screaming because it hurt so bad.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctors soon placed Liam under sedation and life support, and&nbsp;on January 21, they transferred him to&nbsp;Randall Children&rsquo;s Hospital to be examined by another medical team. About a half-hour later, doctors informed Hebard that they had &ldquo;done everything that they could do,&rdquo; and Liam passed away later that day. Before the accident, Liam&mdash;who Hebard says was a &ldquo;ray of sunshine&rdquo; who was loved by so many&mdash;was a completely healthy boy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, Hebard is warning other families to watch for the symptoms of necrotizing fasciitis, such as chills, fever, fatigue and vomiting. A key sign, she says, is if a cut or a swollen area on the body is more painful than what is expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://people.com/human-interest/mom-of-three-with-flu-diagnosis-is-now-hospitalized-with-flesh-eating-disease/\"><strong>RELATED ARTICLE: Mom of Three with Flu Diagnosis Is Now Hospitalized with Flesh-Eating Disease</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The family set up a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/liam-flanagan-medical-fundraiser\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GoFundMe account</a> to help with expenses, and it has raised $16,000 so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Even though this is my worst nightmare, I want to&nbsp;believe&nbsp;his death had a reason, it had a purpose. Maybe it&rsquo;s to save other&rsquo;s lives, because no one deserves to go through what we went through,&rdquo; Hebard says through tears. &ldquo;Hold your babies&nbsp;tight and listen to them.

The alignment of the full moon will make it look like a <a href=\"http://time.com/4570604/supermoon-views-video/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;supermoon&rdquo;</a> due to its increased proximity to Earth, causing the satellite to appear slightly larger and brighter than usual. Additionally, it will mark the second full moon of the month, an event often described as a &ldquo;blue moon.&rdquo; And third, this full moon happens to fall during a total lunar eclipse, which is sometimes called a &ldquo;blood moon&rdquo; due to the reddish-orange light totally eclipsed moons emit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;A lot of things are happening at once,&rdquo; said Dr. Noah Petro, a planetary geologist at NASA&rsquo;s Goddard Space Flight Center. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cool event.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to miss the blue moon eclipse, here&rsquo;s everything you need to know about when it&rsquo;s happening, where it&rsquo;s happening, and how to watch it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>When is the blue moon eclipse happening?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The blue moon eclipse will occur on Wednesday, Jan. 31. For people in the United States, totality will begin around 7:51 a.m. EST, or 4:51 a.m. PST, with the period of totality expected to last roughly 1 hour and 16 minutes. Observers on the West Coast will enjoy a better view since the sky will still be dark when the total eclipse begins. Which brings us to&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Where is the best place to watch the blue moon eclipse?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted, people in California and the rest of the West Coast can enjoy prime views of the blue moon eclipse if they wake up early. Those in Mountain Time states like Colorado should get a decent look as well because they&rsquo;re only an hour ahead. By the time totality begins on the East Coast, the sun will have started to rise while the moon will have begun to set. Depending on weather conditions, East Coasters may still be able to see the blood moon, but the sight will be less impressive without a dark, contrasting sky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Petro also said that residents in Australia and Asia will get a &ldquo;really good view&rdquo; of the blue moon eclipse.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How should you watch the blue moon eclipse?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike a <a href=\"http://time.com/4843775/total-solar-eclipse-2017-facts/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">total solar eclipse</a>, a total lunar eclipse cannot damage your eyes, making it safe to look at without any special glasses or equipment. The key is just to wake up early enough to view the spectacle and to get in a prime position to observe it without obstruction. That means it may be worth it for city dwellers to head out to more rural areas or open spaces without light pollution or tall buildings to get in the way of the blue moon eclipse.</p>\r\n]]>  </content:encoded>\n  <media:group>\n    <media:content url=\"http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/200x150/public/field/image/04437056.jpg?itok=zN75OUey\" type=\"image/jpeg\" isDefault=\"false\" expression=\"sample\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" />\n    <media:thumbnail url=\"http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/75x75/public/field/image/04437056.jpg?itok=YtxyBidn\" type=\"image/jpeg\" isDefault=\"false\" expression=\"sample\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\">\n    </media:thumbnail>\n    <media:keywords/>\n    <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><p>NARENDRA SHRESTHA\u2014EPA</p>\r\n</media:credit>\n  </media:group>\n</item>\n\n<item>\n  <title>\n    <![CDATA[These 6 Tweets Perfectly Sum Up Our Thoughts on the Larry Nassar Trial\r\n]]>  </title>\n  <link>\n  <![CDATA[http://www.health.com/mind-body/tweets-larry-nassar-trial]]>  </link>\n  <pubDate>\n    <![CDATA[Thu, 25 Jan 2018 16:25:33 -0500]]>  </pubDate>\n  <dc:creator>\n    <![CDATA[Health]]>  </dc:creator>\n  <section><![CDATA[ ]]></section> \n  <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">\n    <![CDATA[http://www.health.com/mind-body/tweets-larry-nassar-trial]]>  </guid>\n  <description>\n    <![CDATA[&quot;Little girls don&#39;t stay little forever.

He worked at a clinic in Oldenburg from 1999 to 2002 and in nearby Delmenhorst from 2003 to 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hoegel was convicted in 2015 of two murders and two attempted murders in Delmenhorst and was given a life sentence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his trial, Hoegel had said he intentionally brought about cardiac crises in about 90 patients in Delmenhorst because he enjoyed the feeling of being able to resuscitate them. He later told investigators that he also killed patients in Oldenburg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those statements prompted investigators to carry out toxicological examinations on dozens of other patients who died at the hospitals, leading to the new charges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t immediately clear when a new trial at the state court in Oldenburg might start. Additional convictions could affect Hoegel&rsquo;s possibility of parole, but there are no consecutive sentences in Germany. In general, people serving life sentences are considered for parole after 15 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the new cases, 62 involve patients who died in Delmenhorst and 35 patients in Oldenburg. Prosecutor Martin Koziolek said that, in three further cases investigators viewed as suspicious, tests didn&rsquo;t produce enough evidence to add them to the charge sheet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hoegel used a variety of drugs in his resuscitation attempts, Koziolek said. He added that prosecutors believe Hoegel &ldquo;in all cases at least accepted the death of the patients as a result of the effect of the drugs.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of a wider investigation involving both hospitals, police and prosecutors reviewed more than 500 patient files and hundreds more hospital records. They also exhumed 134 bodies from 67 cemeteries, and questioned Hoegel six times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Police have said if local health officials hadn&rsquo;t hesitated in alerting authorities, Hoegel could have been stopped earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Authorities are already pursuing criminal cases against former staff at the medical facilities.</p>\r\n]]>  </content:encoded>\n  <media:group>\n    <media:content url=\"http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/200x150/public/field/image/niels-hoegel-germany-nurse-patients-murder.jpg?itok=r-65zNyl\" type=\"image/jpeg\" isDefault=\"false\" expression=\"sample\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" />\n    <media:thumbnail url=\"http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/75x75/public/field/image/niels-hoegel-germany-nurse-patients-murder.jpg?itok=gQ5QXgaN\" type=\"image/jpeg\" isDefault=\"false\" expression=\"sample\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\">\n    </media:thumbnail>\n    <media:keywords/>\n    <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><p>Carmen Jaspersen\u2014AP</p>\r\n</media:credit>\n  </media:group>\n</item>\n  </channel>\n</rss>\n",
